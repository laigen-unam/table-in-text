Abstract . 
The effects of berberine on growth , arylamine N-acetyltransferase ( NAT ) activity , and gene expression in Salmonella Typhi ( Typhi ) were described . 
The growth inhibition of Typhi was determined by measuring absorbance by optical density ( OD at 650 nm ) . 
The NAT activity was determined by measuring the levels of 2-aminofluorene ( AF ) and N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene ( AAF ) by high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography . 
The results demonstrated that 24-h berberine treatment decreased bacteria growth and amounts of AAF in Typhi . 
Western blotting and flow cytometry were used for examining the levels of NAT after bacteria were cotreated with or without various concentrations of berberine , and results indicated that berberine decreased the levels of NAT in Typhi . 
Polymerase chain reaction was used for examining the gene expression of NAT ( mRNA NAT ) , and results indicated that berberine affects mRNA NAT1 expression in Typhi . 
Arylamine N-acetyltransferases ( NATs ) are widely distributed in many species including eukaryotes and prokaryotes , with more than 20 NATs identified [ 11 , 15 , 18 ] . 
Many arylamine chemicals require N-acetylation to form metabolites before leading to carcinogenesis . 
N-Acetylation is the first step for arylamine metabolites , and it is catalyzed by cytosolic NAT using acetyl coenzyme A as a cofactor [ 26 ] . 
Individuals can be classified into slow and rapid acetylator phenotypes based on liver cytosolic NAT activity [ 9 ] . 
After individuals were exposed to these arylamines , the slow or rapid acetylator phenotype can influence both therapeutic response and toxicity [ 26 ] . 
NAT polymorphism has pharmacogenetic implications , leading to different rates of inactivation of drugs , including the anti-tuber-cular agent isoniazid and the anti-hypertensive drug hydralazine [ 22 , 23 ] . 
Berberine , an isoquinoline alkaloid , has a wide range of pharmacological effects , including anti-inflammation [ 17 ] , with a long history of being used as a tonic remedy for liver dysfunction in some populations [ 25 ] . 
Many studies have demonstrated that berberine , a yellow benzylisoquinoline alkaloid , is conventionally used as an antidiarrhetic , bitter stomachic , and antimalaria drug in many countries [ 27 ] . 
They often show strong cytotoxicity to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells ; for example , vincristine inhibits microtubule formation , and berberine inhibits DNA and protein synthesis [ 10 ] . 
Because of these activities , alkaloids are presumed to play an important role as a biological barrier to protect the plant tissue from pathogens . 
Indeed , berberine shows strong antimicrobial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as other microorganisms [ 15 ] . 
NAT activities had been demonstrated to exist in some human gastrointestinal flora [ 18 ] . 
There is no available information that addresses the effects of berberine on NAT activity ( N-acetylation of 2-AF ) and gene expression ( mRNA NAT in Typhi . 
We report herein whether berberine could affect growth in Typhi and in vitro evaluation of the activity as inhibitor of bacterial NAT .

Materials and Methods
The Bio-Rad protein assay kit was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories ( Hercules , CA ) , and all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich ( St. Louis , MO ) and Merck Co. ( Darmstadt , Germany ) . 
Berberine affects the growth of Salmonella Typhi . 
Typhi was collected in the Department of Clinical Laboratory , China Medical University Hospital , in mid-Taiwan . 
The isolate was identified on the basis of routine microbiologic methods and was confirmed using the VITEK system ( BioMerieux Vitek Inc. , Hazelwood , MO ) . 
About 1 · 108 bacteria were placed in individual tubes containing 1 mL tryptic soy broth with or without different concentrations of berberine ( 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 25 , and 50 lM ) . 
The control reactions had 10 lL DMSO in place of berberine . 
The culture tubes were incubated at 35 C with 5 % CO2 and checked for growth after 24 h . 
The determination of the effects of berberine on the Typhi was described previously . 
Growth inhibition ( % ) was determined using the equation described previously [ 19 ] . 
Preparation of Salmonella Typhi cell lysates . 
An amount of 1 · 1010 colony-forming units ( cfu ) of Typhi was washed twice in cold phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and was then immediately placed in 1 mL of lysis buffer [ 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 ( at 4 C ) , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 50 lM PMSF , and 10 lM leupeptin ] . 
The cell suspensions were disrupted in a sonicator ( Hert Systems , Inc. , Farmingdale , NY ) and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 g ; the supernatant was kept on ice until assayed for NAT activity ( n-acetylation of AF ) and protein determination [ 19 ] . 
NAT activity determination . 
The determination of total amounts of acetylated and nonacetylated AF were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) as described by Chung et al. in 1998 [ 5 ] . 
Protein determination . 
Protein concentrations of the bacterial cell lysates were determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard [ 2 ] . 
All of the samples were assayed in triplicate . 
Berberine affects NAT activity in Salmonella Typhi cell lysates . 
Berberine was dissolved in DMSO at various concentrations ( 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 25 , and 50 lM ) . 
The reaction mixtures consisted of 50 lL cell lysates ( Typhi ) , 20 lL of recycling mixture containing 22.5 lM AF , and 10 lL of berberine . 
The reactions were started by the addition of Ac-CoA . 
The control reactions had 20 lL of distilled water in place of Ac-CoA . 
After these steps , the NAT activity was determined as described above [ 19 ] . 
Berberine affects NAT activity in intact bacterial cells . 
For the intact cell studies , 1 · 109 cfu of bacteria in 1 mL trypticase soy broth were incubated with 22.5 lM AF with or without various concentrations ( 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 25 , and 50 lM ) of berberine for 24 h . 
After incubation , the media suspensions were removed and centrifuged . 
The supernatant was immediately extracted with ethylacetate/methanol ( 95:5 ) , the solvent evaporated under speed vacuum , and the residue dissolved in methanol and assayed by HPLC [ 19 ] . 
All samples were run in triplicate . 
Berberine affects kinetic constants of NAT from Salmonella Typhi cell lysates . 
Cell lysates of Typhi cotreated with or without 25 lM berberine and selected concentrations ( 5.625 , 11.25 , 22.5 , 45 , and 90 lM ) of AF were performed for NAT activity as described above [ 19 ] . 
Berberine effect on NAT protein levels and was examined by SDS ¬ 
PAGE and Western blot . 
About 1 · 109 cfu of bacteria were cotreated with or without various concentrations of berberine for 24 h. Typhi were then harvested and centrifuged to remove and discard the medium , while the cells were washed with PBS . 
The cells were lysed in 100 lL of triple detergent buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 8.0 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0.02 % NaN3 , 0.1 % SDS , 1 % NP-40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 100 lg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 lg/mL aprotinin , 1 lg/mL leupeptin , and 1 lg/mL pepstatin A ) . 
The samples were then sonicated , incubated on ice for 20 min , and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 C . 
The supernatants were collected and the Bradford assay was performed to determine the protein concentration . 
Proteins ( 50 lg/lane ) were separated on 12 % SDS -- polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinyliene difluoride membranes . 
The membrane was incubated with 5 % bovine serum albumin and primary antibody ( anti-NAT ) at 4 C overnight . 
The blots were washed three times in PBS with 0.04 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 5 min , then incubated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibody at 1:1000 dilution in PBST containing 5 % milk for 2 h at room temperature . 
The membranes were washed with PBST and visualized using an ECL detection system ( Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) and quantitated by densitometry using ImageQuant image analysis . 
Berberine affects NAT gene expression and was examined by 
PCR . 
The total RNA was extracted from Typhi by using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit at 24 h afterwards with or without co-treatment of 25 lM berberine . 
Total RNA ( 1.5 lg ) , 0.5 lg of oligo-dT primer , and DEPC ( diethyl pyrocarbonate ) - treated water were combined into a microcentrifuge tube to a final volume of 12.5 lL . 
The entire mixture was heated at 70 C for 10 min and chilled on ice for at least 1 min . 
The subsequent procedures for conducting reverse transcription were exactly the same as those in the instruction manual ( First-strand cDNA synthesis kit , Novagen ) [ 14 ] . 
The reverse transcription products from total RNA served as a template for PCR . 
When amplifying target cDNA , components in 50 lL of solution were as follows : 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 0.2 mM dNTP mix , 20 pmol of each primer ( B-MDIEA-NAT1 & VPKHGD-X-NAT1 for NAT1 , FP1-NAT2 & RP1-NAT2 for NAT2 , Act b1 & Act b2 for beta-actin ) , cDNA template corresponding to the amount synthesized from 50 ng of total RNA and 2 units of DyNAzyme DNA polymerase .

The kinetic constants were calculated with the Cleland HYPER Program [ 6 ] that performs linear regression using a least-squares method 
Results Berberine affects the growth of Salmonella 
Typhi . 
The data from intact bacteria cells culture cotreated with or without various concentrations of berberine on the growth of inhibition from Typhi is given in Fig. 1 . 
The growth of Typhi was inhibited by berberine in a dose-dependent manner . 
Therefore , the concentration of berberine for IC50 value is 18 lM for Typhi . 
Berberine affects the NAT activity of Salmonella 
Typhi . 
The effects of berberine on the NAT activity in Typhi in cell lysates and intact bacteria were examined by HPLC , assessing the percentage of N-acetylation of AF ( AAF production ) . 
Cell lysates or suspensions of Typhi with or without various concentrations ( 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 25 , and 50 lM ) of berberine cotreatment showed different percentages of AF acetylation ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The data indicated that berberine induced dose-dependent effect in both cell lysates and intact bacteria . 
Berberine affects the kinetic constants of NAT of 
Salmonella Typhi . 
NAT activity was found in the cell lysates of the bacterial Typhi . 
A double reciprocal plot of the data for 25 lM berberine inhibition to NAT activity in Typhi was prepared and given in Table 1 . 
Clearly , when 25 lM berberine was added to the reaction mixtures , the apparent values of Km and Vmax were decreased 46.6 % and 52.7 % for cell lysates of Typhi . 
Berberine affects the enzyme expression of NAT from Salmonella Typhi . 
The expression of NAT protein was measured by the ability of NAT antibody to form an antigen -- antibody complex . 
The result from SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiment are given in Fig. 3A and 3B . 
The results demonstrated that 25 lM berberine inhibited NAT enzyme expression in Typhi . 
Berberine affects the gene expression of NAT ( mRNA 
NAT ) from Salmonella Typhi . 
To investigate whether berberine affects the gene expression of NAT , we performed reverse transcription -- polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on Typhi RNA using specific primers for NAT1 , NAT2 , and b-actin . 
The result from the PCR experiment is given in Fig. 4A . 
The mRNA levels of NAT and b-actin on gel electrophoresis were quantified by densitometric analysis of gel photographs and expressed as NAT/b-actin ( Fig. 4B ) . 
The results demonstrated that 25 lM berberine did inhibit NAT mRNA expression in Typhi . 
Discussion
In human populations , arylamine-induced neoplasms within target organs may indicate differential risks in NAT activities that are genetically mediated variations [ 11 ] . 
However , it is reported that enteric bacteria contain enzymes that are known to contribute to the metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens in animal studies [ 16 ] . 
The intestinal microflora have been revealed to contain NATs which acetylated arylamines from the animal studies [ 18 ] . 
The first three-dimensional NAT structure was resolved for NAT from Salmonella typhimurium , and subsequently the structure of NAT fro

Effect of berberine on the growth of Typhi . 
The bacteria cells ( 1 · 109 ) in each tube cotreated with 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 25 , and 50 lM berberine for 24 h . 
The percents of inhibition are the mean $ SD ; n = 3 as described in the text . 
Mycobacterium smegmatis has been elucidated [ 22 ] . 
In addition to the identification of NAT in prokaryotes , there has been considerable interest in the identification of homologous NAT sequences in eukaryotes . 
Our previous studies have shown that many kinds of enteric bacteria such as K. pneumoniae , Salmonella group B , Staphylococcus aureus , Shigella sonnei , and Helicob-acter pylori exhibit NAT activity [ 5 , 19 , 24 ] . 
Therefore , the present study was focused on the effect of berberine on growth and NAT activity of Typhi . 
The results clearly demonstrated that berberine inhibited growth , NAT activity , protein levels , and gene expression ( mRNA NAT1 ) on Typhi . 
These effects occurred in a dose-dependent manner . 
Berberine can be used as a bacerticidal to Typhi . 
Based on the decreased 
Values are mean $ S.D. n = 3 . 
The acetyl CoA and berberine concentrations were 0.1 mM and 0.25 mM , respectively and the kinetic constants were calculated from the modified HYPER Program of Cleland . 
All experiments and controls were run in triplicate . 
a Different between 25 lM berberine and control ( P < 0.05 ) . 
value of kinetic constant of NAT , it was suggested that berberine might act as an uncompetitive inhibitor . 
It i well known that the enzyme inhibitor can be divided into competitive , uncompetitive , and noncompetitive inhibitor . 
A competitive inhibitor competes with the substrate for binding at the same site on the active enzyme . 
An uncompetitive inhibitor binds to a different site but blocks the conversion of the substrate to the products that lead to change Vmax while Km maintains the same . 
A noncompetitive inhibitor binds only to the enzyme -- substrate complex , which leads to changing both values of Km and Vmax [ 28 ] . 
Apparently , further investigations are needed for the mechanism of berberine effects on the growth of Typhi . 
The reason for our selection of AF for N-acetylation of Typhi is that 1 ) human intestinal bacteria exhibit different N-acetylation activity for AF ; 2 ) AF is the common substrate for NATs [ 12 ] ; 3 ) AF is a kind of arylamine carcinogen [ 13 ] ; 4 ) it is more convenient for the determination by HPLC of the quantity of AF and AAF . 
The intestinal microflora in mice play an important role in the metabolic activation and absorption of 1-nitropyrene , and human microflora also can metabolize 1-nitropyrene to form 1-aminopyrene and N-formyl-1-aminopyrene [ 23 ] . 
NAT enzyme of human enteric bacteria may contribute to the metabolic activation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [ 4,5-fluroquinoline [ 20 , 22 ] . 
Our results indicate that Typhi may be involved in the metabolic activation or the detoxification of the arylamine carcinogens in humans . 
Although we discovered the reducing of NAT mRNA in these bacteria after cotreatment with berberine , it is still unclear how these compounds get into the bacteria cells , how bacteria react to this chemical , and what kind of enzymes are involved in this mechanism . 
Apparently , further work is required to explain the mechanism of berberine inhibition of AF N-acetylation . 
However , our findings may offer some information on the possibility of decreasing arylamine carcinogens in induced carcinogenesis , because the increased levels of NAT activity may be associated with increased sensitivity to the mutagenic effects of many arylamines [ 9 ] . 
Furthermore , breast and bladder cancers have been demonstrated to be associated with the attenuation of NAT activity in the liver [ 13 , 26 ] . 
The differences in NAT activity may be dependent on interindividual genetic variations and are potential sources of toxicological/pathological susceptibilit among human populations [ 7 , 8 ] . 
However , substrate-dependent downregulation [ 1 , 3 ] and oxidative-depen-dent inactivation [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] may also regulate NAT activity . 
Apparently , it appears that the overall NAT activity in cells or tissues may depend on both genetic and environmental factors .
