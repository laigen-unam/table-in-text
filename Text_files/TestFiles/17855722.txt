Objectives : To study how disinfectants affect antimicrobial susceptibility and phenotype of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 . 
Methods : Wild-type strain SL1344 and its isogenic gyrA mutant were passaged daily for 7 days in subinhibitory concentrations , and separately for 16 days in gradually increasing concentrations of a quaternary ammonium disinfectant containing formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde ( QACFG ) , an oxidizing compound blend ( OXC ) , a phenolic tar acids-based disinfectant ( TOP ) and triclosan . 
The MICs of anti-microbials and antibiotics for populations and representative isolates and the proportion of cells resistant to the MICs for the wild-type were determined . 
Expression of acrB gene , growth at 378C and invasiveness of populations in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells were assessed . 
Results : QACFG and triclosan showed the highest selectivity for variants with reduced susceptibility to chloramphenicol , tetracycline , ampicillin , acriﬂavine and triclosan . 
Populations treated with the above biocides had reduced invasiveness in Caco-2 cells , and altered growth kinetics . 
Resistance to disinfectants was observed only after exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of triclosan , accompanied with a 2000-fold increase in its MIC . 
Growth in OXC and TOP did not affect the MICs of antibiotics , but resulted in the appearance of a proportion of cells resistant to the MIC of acriﬂavine and triclosan for the wild-type . 
Randomly selected stable variants from all populations , except the one treated with TOP , over-expressed acrB . 
Conclusions : In vitro exposure to QACFG and triclosan selects for Salmonella Typhimurium cells with reduced susceptibility to several antibiotics . 
This is associated with overexpression of AcrAB efﬂux pump , but accompanied with reduced invasiveness . 
Keywords : quaternary ammonium , triclosan , AcrAB 
Introduction
Non-typhoidal Salmonella caused over 12 000 reported cases of enteritis in England and Wales in 2006 , and over 65 000 across 1 Europe in 2004 , resulting in signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality . 
2 While most cases require only simple bed rest and re-hydration , a proportion , particularly among the more vulnerable , may require antibiotic therapy . 
Clinically signiﬁcant resistance to multiple antibiotics in Salmonella has been increasing and over 30 % of isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reported to the Enter-net surveillance network in 2004 were resistant to three or more antibiotics resulting in reduced therapeutic options . 
Recent regulations preventing the use of 2 antibiotics as growth promoters in animals have been introduced in an attempt to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the food chain . 
This has necessitated an increase in the use of 3 biosecurity measures that include the application of disinfectants to reduce microbial contamination of animal houses . 
In addition , antiseptics and disinfectants are used extensively by all industrial components of the food-chain . 
Resistance to a disinfectant is thought unlikely to occur because most disinfectants are often complexes of antimicrobials 4 that inactivate multiple cellular targets . 
A single mutation would be unlikely to confer resistance . 
However , resistance to a disin-4 ,5 fectant such as triclosan which inactivates a speciﬁc cellular target , does occur as a result of speciﬁc mutations altering the target , in this case fabI . 
Resistance to antiseptics and disinfec-6 ,7 tants associated with plasmids and integrons carrying efﬂux-related transporters , such as qacE , and also antibiotic resistance determinants has been well-studied . 
Reduced susceptibility to 8 speciﬁc agents including quaternary ammonium compounds , chlorhexidine , diamidines and acridines is also known to occur . 
4,9 This phenomenon has been implicated as a possible cause for the selection and persistence of bacterial strains with reduced suscep-4 tibility to a range of agents , including antibiotics and it has been speculated that these bacteria could pass along the food chain . 
10 Efﬂux , together with membrane impermeability , is an import-ant non-speciﬁc defence mechanism that can confer multiple antibiotic resistance ( MAR ) in S. enterica and Escherichia coli and a better understanding of the genes mediating this phenom-enon and the pressures favouring selection of the MAR phenotype is urgently required . 
Efﬂux pumps are membrane 11,12 proteins that actively export a wide range of toxic substrates , including antibiotics , dyes and disinfectants thereby preventing accumulation of toxic agents and mediating resistance . 
13,14 Various studies in E. coli and S. enterica have demonstrated that efﬂux pumps play an important role in intrinsic resistance to unrelated antibiotics such as ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracycline , or disinfectants including quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan . 
They also seem to be important for viru-10 -- 12,14,15 lence . 
The wide spectrum of substrates recognized by efﬂux 16 -- 18 systems has prompted concern that exposure of a bacterium to 19,20 one substrate could confer resistance to others . 
Thus exposure to disinfectants could result in selection of efﬂux mutants with reduced susceptibility to unrelated antibiotics and biocides , not previously encountered by the bacterium . 
In the present study , we investigated the hypothesis that disinfectants can select MAR strains of Salmonella Typhimurium . 
The aim was to examine the effects of sequential growth of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 and its isogenic gyrA mutant for 7 days in subinhibitory concentrations of different disinfectants on the antimicrobial resistance , invasiveness and growth . 
In addition , we assessed the expression of the acrB gene as a marker for increased efﬂux .

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 and its isogenic 21 mutant ( L696 ) carrying the substitution Asp-87 ! 
Gly within GyrA were used throughout . 
Puriﬁed cultures of strains were stored in microbank tubes ( Pro-lab Diagnostics , Neston , UK ) at 2808C and were grown routinely in Luria Bertani ( LB ) broth and on LB agar ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , Hampshire , UK ) with or without disinfectants at 378C with shaking at 160 rpm for the broth . 
Chemicals
Dyes and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( Poole , UK ) , except for ciproﬂoxacin , which was obtained from Fluka Chemie ( Buchs , Switzerland ) and triclosan which was obtained from Ciba Geigy ( Basel , Switzerland ) . 
The disinfectants used were : an oxidizing compounds blend containing an inorganic peroxygen compound , inorganic salts , organic acid , anionic detergent , fragrance and dye ( OXC ) ; a quaternary ammonium disinfectant containing formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde ( QACFG ) ; a phenolic biocide composed of tar acids , organic acids and surfactants ( TOP ) ; and a dairy quaternary ammonium sterilizer containing non-ionic surfactant and excipients ( DQACS ) . 
Disinfectant exposure experiments
Two types of experiments were performed : type 1 , where cultures were sequentially grown in LB broth containing no agent or 0.2 % OXC , 0.025 % TOP , 0.006 % QACFG , 0.06 mg/L triclosan for up to 7 days . 
Each day , an inoculum of 1 % ( v/v ) from the overnight culture was used to prepare the culture of the following day in LB supplemented with the same concentration of the corresponding disinfectant . 
In type 2 experiments , cultures were transferred daily for up to 16 days to gradually increasing concentrations of disinfectants . 
Concentrations were increased daily by 1 mg/L for triclosan and 25 % of the MIC for the other disinfectants . 
On day 6 , for sequential growth in constant disinfectant concentrations and day 15 , for sequential growth in gradually increasing concentrations , one milli-litre samples from cultures were harvested and stored in microbank tubes at 2808C for subsequent antibiotic susceptibility testing . 
Before exposure to antibiotics and antimicrobials , cultures were removed from storage and grown overnight in fresh LB with the corresponding subinhibitory concentrations of the disinfectants . 
Ten-fold serial dilutions of these cultures were prepared in sterile saline solution ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) and transferred in triplicate onto LB agar plates ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) , with or without different antimicrobials at the MIC of the disinfectant or antibiotic for SL1344 , or L696 . 
These were : 0.06 mg/L of triclosan , 400 mg/L of acriﬂavine , 2 mg/L of ampicillin , 8 mg/L of chloramphenicol , 0.003 mg/L ciproﬂoxacin , 2 mg/L of kanamycin and 2 mg/L of tetracycline . 
Agar plates were incubated at 378C for 24 h and numbers of cfu determined . 
Determination of MICs
The minimal inhibitory concentrations of a range of antibiotics , dyes and disinfectants were determined using the agar doubling dilution method according to the recommendations of the BSAC . 
21 
Gentamicin protection assay (invasiveness)
The gentamicin protection assay was performed for the wild-type strain and all populations derived from it , as described previously by Elsinghorst . 
In brief , Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma 22 cells ( ECACC number 86010202 ) were maintained in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) containing 2 mM glutamine , 1 % non-essential amino acids and 10 % FBS . 
Penicillin/streptomycin ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) was used at a concentration of 100 U/mL in DMEM until 3 days before cells were used for infection studies . 
Culture medium was changed every 2 -- 3 days . 
Just before experiments , Caco-2 cells were washed three times with sterile PBS and subsequently 2 mL antibiotic-free DMEM was added to each well . 
The OD600 of stationary phase bacterial cultures of the populations and the wild-type was measured and all cultures were adjusted to similar OD600 value . 
We previously conﬁrmed that there was a good correlation between OD600 measurements and cell numbers for all strains , assessed by comparing cfu and OD values . 
Fifty microlitres of the adjusted bacterial suspension was added to the well , resulting in 10 cfu per well and yielding an estimated 6 ratio of bacteria to cells ( multiplicity of infection ) of 2.5:1 . 
Cells were incubated for 1 h at 378C and subsequently washed twice with PBS and suspended in PBS containing 100 mg/L of gentamicin . 
After 2 h at 378C , Caco-2 cells exposed to gentamicin were rinsed twice with sterile PBS and lysed with 2 mL of 1 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 in PBS . 
Following incubation for 5 min at 378C cell lysates were serially diluted and plated on COLBA to quantify the number of intracellular bacteria . 
The t-test for two samples assuming equal variances was used to determine statistical differences between the means in invaded cells of each population and of the wild-type . 
P values ,0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant . 
Analysis of growth kinetics
Growth characteristics of all populations were assessed at 378C with shaking ( 160 rpm ) . 
Five microlitres from an overnight culture of each population was inoculated into 200 mL of fresh LB broth . 
Samples were placed in a microtitre plate and bacterial growth was assessed by measuring the OD600 of the samples in a Bioscreen C microplate reader ( Labsystems , Helsinki , Finland ) . 
Growth curves were constructed in triplicate . 
Isolation of variants from populations
In order to investigate the composition and the possible mechanisms conferring any antimicrobial resistance observed in the populations , individual isolates TOP R1 and R2 , QACFG R1 and R2 , OXC R1 and R2 and TRIC R1 and R2 were obtained from each of the corresponding wild-type-derived populations TOP 7d , QACFG 7d , OXC 7d and 16TRIC 16d , respectively . 
Individual isolates from populations QACFG 7d and 16TRIC 16d were obtained by streaking a sample from each of the parent cultures on LB agar plates containing no antimicrobials , as these populations contained mainly var-iants with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobials . 
However , in order to obtain such variants from populations OXC 7d and TOP 7d , a selective pressure had to be applied , as the majority of their cells demonstrated a wild-type phenotype regarding anti-microbial resistance ( Figure 1 ) . 
A sample from the OXC 7d population was streaked on an agar plate containing 400 mg/L of acriﬂavine , and 10 randomly selected colonies were screened for decreased antibiotic susceptibility . 
The same procedure was followed for TOP 7d , and two colonies were isolated on an agar plate containing 6 mg/L of chloramphenicol . 
All isolates were identiﬁed as Salmonella spp . 
after growth on XLD agar plates , Gram staining , multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats ( VNTR ) analysis and molecular subtyping by PFGE , as described below . 
Stability of phenotype and typing of individual isolates
All individual isolates were assessed for phenotypic stability . 
They were subcultured for 10 consecutive days using 0.3 % ( v/v ) inocula in fresh LB medium in the absence of any disinfectant at 378C . 
On day 10 , cultures were tested for their antibiotic and disinfectant resistance as described earlier . 
The individual isolates were typed by multiple-locus VNTR analysis using the method of Lindstedt et al. , and molecular sub-23 typing by PFGE . 
PFGE was performed following XbaI digestion of genomic DNA according to the standard 1 day protocol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
24 
RT – PCR analysis of expression of acrB
The expression of acrB in all representative isolates that demonstrated the MAR phenotype was investigated using comparative RT -- PCR . 
Three separate cultures for each isolate were used to 25 obtain RNA . 
Mid-exponential phase cultures grown in LB broth were harvested and pellets re-suspended in one-ﬁfth volume of ice-cold 95 % ethanol and 5 % phenol . 
Cultures were harvested during mid-exponential growth . 
Suspensions were kept on ice for 30 min before cells were re-harvested by centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 min at 48C . 
Pellets were resuspended in 100 mL of TE buffer containing 50 mg/mL lysozyme and incubated at room temperature for 5 min . 
RNA was puriﬁed using the Promega SV total RNA puri-ﬁcation kit ( Promega , Southampton , UK ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
The quality and quantity of RNA extracted was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by analysis using a NanoDrop apparatus ( NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , USA ) . 
cDNA was synthesized from 2 mg of total RNA for each sample in triplicate , using the SuperScript III system ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) with random primers according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
RT -- PCR reactions and DHPLC analysis for 16S rRNA and acrB ( Transgenomic Ltd , Crewe , UK ) were performed as previously described . 
Data were 25 normalized to the expression of 16S rRNA to minimize cell densitydependent errors , by calculating the mean 16S expression from all RNA preparations . 
Subsequently , the ` area under the curve ' for acrB from the same biological repeat were normalized as described previously . 
The mean and standard deviation of the nine repeats 25 for each data set were calculated , followed by two-tailed , two-sample , equal variance Student 's t-tests to compare gene expression relative to SL1344 . 
Results
Disinfectant exposure experiments
In general , sequential growth of SL1344 and L696 in the pre-sence of QACFG for type 1 experiments and triclosan for type 2 resulted in the appearance of a proportion of cells in each population with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobials . 
Results for SL1344 and L696 were similar throughout . 
In addition , exposure to all disinfectants had no effect on the susceptibility of the ﬁnal populations to kanamycin ( Table 1 ) . 
Except for triclosan , reduced susceptibility to increased concentrations of disinfectants and biocides was not achieved . 
In type 1 experiments , sequential growth in a subinhibitory concentration of OXC resulted in 0.03 and 0.02 % of the cells of the ﬁnal population being resistant to the MICs of the control parent strain for triclosan ( Figure 1a ) and acriﬂavine ( Figure 1b ) , respectively . 
In type 1 experiments with TOP , the ﬁnal population had 7 and 100 % of its cells resistant to the MICs of the control parent strain for triclosan ( Figure 1a ) and acriﬂavine ( Figure 1b ) , respectively . 
Extended growth in QACFG and in gradually increasing concentrations of triclosan ( maximum : 16 mg/L ) resulted in 100 % of the cells of these populations being resistant to the MICs of the control parent strain for triclosan , acriﬂavine , tetracycline , chloramphenicol and ampicillin ( Figure 1a -- e ) . 
In parallel , the MICs for all populations were determined ( Table 1 ) . 
Growth of cultures for 7 days in LB without antimicrobials did not have any effect on the MICs with one exception , that of triclosan which increased 4-fold . 
For all populations , the MICs of all disinfectants , except triclosan , remained stable , indicating that growth with or without disinfectants for seven daily subcultures did not have any effect . 
MICs of OXC , TOP , QACFG and DQACS were 0.2 % , 0.4 % , 0.03 % and 0.2 % , respectively . 
Sequential growth in OXC increased the MIC of ampicillin by 4-fold . 
Sequential growth in TOP did not signiﬁcantly affect the MICs of any agent . 
However , sequential growth in QACFG increased the MICs of tetracycline , ampicillin and triclosan by 4 - , 8 - and 16-fold , respectively . 
Extended growth in 0.06 mg/L triclosan did not result in reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials ( data not shown ) . 
However , the population grown in gradually increasing concentrations of triclosan had an increased MIC of ampicillin and triclosan by 8 - and 1000 -- 2000-fold , respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
Gentamicin protection assay (invasiveness)
All populations demonstrated reduced ability to invade Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells compared with the wild-type ( Figure 2 ) . 
However , only for populations QACFG 7d and 16TRIC 16d was this difference statistically signiﬁcant ( P , 0.05 ) compared with the wild-type . 
QACFG 7d and 16TRIC 16d demonstrated numbers of invaded cells by 1.3 and 
Figure 1 .

16TRIC 16d was obtained by sequential growth for 16 days at rising concentrations of triclosan reaching a maximum of 16 mg/L . 
Experiments were performed in triplicate and error bars represent the SD . 
2.2 logarithmic cycles lower than those of the wild-type . 
Similar results were obtained with L696 ( data not shown ) . 
Analysis of growth kinetics
As the S. enterica populations were a mix of different strains , growth curves did not show the classical growth pattern of monocultures and did not allow us to calculate values like mmax . 
However , all OD600 values for 16TRIC 16d were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the wild-type ( P , 0.05 ) during exponential phase denoting impaired growth . 
This population also showed an increased lag phase but its cell density at stationary phase was the same as wild-type ( Figure 3 ) . 
QACFG 7d showed increased cell density at stationary phase compared with the wild-type , but OXC 7d and TOP 7d showed growth patterns similar to the wild-type . 
Isolation of variants from the populations
Ten isolates were obtained from the OXC 7d population by growth on LB containing 400 mg/L acriﬂavine . 
Nine , including isolate OXC R2 , did not show any reduced susceptibility to anti-biotics . 
The MIC of triclosan was unchanged or increased by

MICs of ciproﬂoxacin ( CIP ) , chloramphenicol ( CHL ) , tetracycline ( TET ) , kanamycin ( KAN ) , ampicillin ( AMP ) and triclosan ( TRIC ) are presented in mg/L , while those of OXC , TOP , QACFG and DQACS are presented in % . 
Populations are named as follows : parent strain , if not mentioned it is the wild-type ; disinfectant and concentration if it is not close to the MIC , from which population was isolated ; days of sequential growth in disinfectant . 
For example , population OXC 7d is derived from wild-type , was isolated from LB broth containing OXC and was sequentially grown for 7 days .

2-fold . 
One isolate ( OXC R1 ) demonstrated a 4-fold increase in the MICs of all antibiotics except that of kanamycin which remained unchanged ( Table 2 ) . 
From two randomly selected isolates obtained from the QACFG 7d population , only one , QACFG R2 , showed reduced susceptibility to multiple antibiotics ( Table 2 ) . 
For this isolate , the MICs of ciproﬂoxacin , chloramphenicol and ampicillin were increased by 4-fold , and that of tetracycline by 8-fold . 
The MIC of kanamycin remained unchanged . 
However , the MICs of TOP and DQACS were reduced by 4 - and 2-fold , respectively . 
QACFG R1 showed similar resistance to the wild-type with the exception of 4-fold increases in the MICs of ampicillin and triclosan . 
TOP R2 showed a 4 - and 8-fold increase in the MICs of triclosan and tetracycline , respectively ( Table 2 ) . 
This strain also had a 2-fold reduction in its susceptibility to DQACS . 
TOP R1 had similar phenotype to the wild-type regarding antimicrobial resistance . 
TRIC R1 and R2 had the same susceptibilities as 16TRIC 16d population from which they were isolated .

Stability of phenotype and typing of individual isolates
All isolates had a stable phenotype following growth in fresh LB for 10 days in the absence of disinfectants . 
VNTR ( Table 3 ) and 
PFGE ( data not shown ) analysis results for all variants were similar to those of the wild-type . 
acrB expression of representative isolates from the populations 
The mRNA levels for the acrB transcript were determined for variants OXC R1 , QACFG R2 , TOP R2 , TRIC R1 and TRIC R2 and compared with those of the parent strain SL1344 . 
TOP R2 demonstrated levels of expression for acrB similar to those of the wild-type ( P . 
0.05 ) , while QACFG R2 , OXC R1 , TRIC R1 and TRIC R2 demonstrated a 3 - to 4-fold higher expression ( P , 0.05 ) as shown in Figure 4 . 
Discussion
In the present study , the ability of several commonly used disinfectants to select for populations and isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics or biocides was assessed . 
Stable variants were isolated , indicating that such exposures were responsible for the reduced susceptibility observed and that this phenomenon was not due to transient stress responses of wild-type cells . 
The gyrA mutation did not affect any of the phenotypic characteristics , apart from reduced susceptibility to ﬂuoroquinolones .

Although sequential growth in subinhibitory concentrations of triclosan did not result in any phenotypic alterations in the population , it was the only disinfectant where its MIC was increased by sequential growth in gradually increasing concentrations of the compound in the growth medium . 
This resulted in a population that was highly triclosan resistant ( 1000 -- 2000-fold increase in the MIC ) . 
This is probably because , unlike most disinfectants , triclosan inactivates a speciﬁc cellular target , FabI which is involved in lipid synthesis . 
Population 16TRIC 6,26 -- 28 16d comprised only variants with reduced susceptibility to multiple antibiotics , acriﬂavine and triclosan . 
This phenomenon was associated with overexpression of acrB , as found in two randomly selected isolates ( TRIC R1 and R2 ) . 
Overexpression of efﬂux pumps including AcrAB can confer resistance to triclosan and acriﬂavine in E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium , as well as low-level resistance to several antibiotics including b-lactams ( ampicillin ) , tetracycline and chloramphenicol . 
The ease by 26,29 which triclosan-resistant variants can occur in a pure culture , even in the absence of selective pressure is demonstrated by the 4-fold increase in the MIC of this compound following sequential growth in LB alone for 7 days . 
QACFG selected for populations with a similar phenotype to 16TRIC 16d and reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials which was also linked to overexpression of acrAB as demonstrated in the randomly selected QACFG R2 variant . 
This conﬁrms the important role of AcrAB in tolerance of Salmonella Typhimurium to quaternary ammonium compounds as previously shown in E. coli . 
The 8-fold increase in the MIC of tri-8 closan for QACFG 7d might be linked with a similar action of AcrAB against both disinfectants , although such increase was not observed with individual isolates derived from this population . 
Interestingly , QACFG R2 was highly sensitive to TOP ( 4-fold decrease in MIC ) and its MIC of DQACS , which was the other quaternary ammonium disinfectant , was reduced by 2-fold , although it was isolated after exposure to a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant . 
It is possible that the surfactants present in both TOP and DQACS , but not in QACFG were highly active against this variant . 
These data indicate that rotational use of different disinfectants in premises might prevent the selection of antibiotic resistant strains . 
Despite the above results with QACFG , it is important to note that the concentration used ( MIC ) was around 166 times lower than the recommended in-use concentration of 1 % , suggesting that adhering to the manufacturer 's recommendations for usage of the disinfectant should prevent the development of strains with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobials . 
OXC and TOP had a lower potential for selection of S. enterica cells with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobials compared with triclosan and QACFG . 
Exposure to OXC and TOP had no major effects on the MICs of the antibiotics . 
However , both disinfectants resulted in the appearance of cells resistant to the antibiotics at the MICs of the control parent strain , and more markedly to those of acriﬂavine and triclosan . 
This was more pronounced with TOP than with OXC and all cells of TOP 7d were resistant to the MIC of acriﬂavine for the control parent strain . 
The randomly selected isolate TOP R2 also had an increased MIC of tetracycline and chloramphenicol . 
Although this was not seen in the TOP 7d population , there was a small proportion of cells resistant to the MICs of these anti-biotics for the control parent strain , probably associated with the presence of variants like TOP R2 . 
The expression of acrB in TOP R2 was similar to that of the wild-type , suggesting that alternate mechanisms like overexpression of other efﬂux pumps or reduced permeability might be responsible for the above phenomena . 
TOP R2 was also more susceptible to DQACS compared with the wild-type , again supporting the rotational use of different disinfectants . 
Under the experimental conditions used in this study , OXC showed the lowest potential for selection of reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobials resulting in lower than 0.1 % proportion of cells resistant to the MIC of the wild-type for all antimicrobials . 
Since OXC 7d probably comprised mainly wild-type-like cells , isolate OXC R1 was not a representative isolate of the population as it was obtained by plating on acriﬂa-vine . 
Like most isolates described in this study , OXC R1 demonstrated reduced susceptibility to chloramphenicol and ampicillin probably associated with increased efﬂux mediated by AcrAB . 
Together with QACFG R2 they were the only isolates with increased MIC of ciproﬂoxacin , which could also be attrib-uted to the latter mechanism , as described previously . 
30,31 Populations QACFG 7d and 16TRIC 16d that demonstrated the lowest reduced susceptibility to multiple antibiotics , also showed statistically signiﬁcant reduced invasiveness in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells . 
The other S. enterica populations also showed lower invasiveness , but the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant . 
These results were also conﬁrmed with the populations obtained in the gyrA mutant background . 
To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report demonstrating that triclosan and quaternary ammonium compounds select for strains with impaired invasiveness . 
Invasiveness of cells in QACFG 7d might have been even lower if an overnight growth in fresh LB without antimicrobials was not included . 
During this step , wildtype cells might have increased their proportion in the population raising its overall invasiveness . 
However , we had to include this step to alleviate any stress responses of S. enterica cells due to the presence of disinfectants in the medium that could possibly affect invasiveness . 
Presence of wild-type cells in the populations obtained with constant concentrations of disinfectants is certain since the concentrations used were subinhibi-tory . 
These ﬁndings might explain the discrepancies between in vitro studies clearly linking the use of certain disinfectants with antibiotic resistance , and epidemiological data that do not point to this direction . 
Triclosan is known to down-regulate viru-5 ,32 lence factors in E. coli , but this is a transient stress response and 33 not a permanent phenotypic change . 
Whether the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are involved in impairment of invasiveness warrants further investigation . 
Previous work in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has suggested that overexpression of the Mex efﬂux pumps resulted in reduced expression of viru-34 lence determinants . 
Population 16TRIC 16d had impaired growth during exponential phase but its ﬁnal population density was similar to that of the wild-type . 
In contrast , QACFG 7d reached a higher cell density than the wild-type . 
It has previously been shown that cells of E. coli overexpressing AcrAB grow to lower cell densities at stationary phase but no adverse effects on virulence have been reported . 
35 Our work demonstrates that subinhibitory concentrations of disinfectants , which might occur during poor disinfection and cleaning procedures , can lead to selection of strains with reduced susceptibility , or even resistance to antibiotics . 
These effects were more pronounced with a quaternary ammoniumbased biocide and with the use of high concentrations of triclo-san . 
However , the dissemination of these strains might be low due to impaired virulence . 
In further work , we studied the phenotype ( e.g. virulence ) of several isolates obtained from these populations and analysed their proteomes , identifying alterations in the expression of several proteins . 
Further research on this is important , to reveal the genetic basis of disinfectant tolerance , its contribution to antibiotic resistance and the possible role of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in virulence .
