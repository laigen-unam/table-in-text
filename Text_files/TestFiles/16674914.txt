Abstract 
The ﬂagellum-speciﬁc export system is a specialized type III export machinery . 
Terminally truncated fragments of ﬂagellin ( FliC ) were used to identify the secretion signal in the main component of ﬂagellar ﬁlaments . 
The ﬁrst 13 residues were not essential for export , but removal of 29 or more residues destroyed export ability . 
When an 8 kDa human protein domain was fused to various N-terminal fragments of FliC , the 26 -- 47 sequence alone was suficient to mediate secretion of this protein module through the ﬂagellum speciﬁc export pathway . 
Neither half of this segment was enough to direct export of the attached protein domain . 
Our results demonstrate that the 22-residue long 26 -- 47 segment within the disordered N-terminal region of Salmonella ﬂagellin contains the recognition signal for the ﬂa-gellar export machinery .

Flagella are the locomotion organelles of bacteria . 
These supramolecular surface structures extend from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior , and are composed of three major structural elements , the basal body , the hook , and the ﬁlament [ 1 ] . 
The major part of the ﬂagellum is the helical ﬁlament , which works as a propeller rotated by a membrane-embedded molecular motor at its base part . 
Each ﬁlament may comprise as many as 20000 ﬂagellin subunits . 
External ﬂagellar proteins , lying beyond the cytoplasmic membrane , are synthesized in the cell and exported by the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc export apparatus from the cytoplasm to the site of assembly at the distal end of the growing ﬁlament [ 2,3 ] . 
They are assumed to move through the narrow -- 25 to 30 Å wide -- central channel of the ﬂagellum

Since only the axial ﬂagellar proteins and some controlling factors are transported through the central channel , some kind of gating apparatus has been thought to exist at the cytoplasmic face of the FliF ring complex of basal body to distinguish ﬂagellar proteins from other cytoplasmic proteins and to facilitate their transportation . 
It is unclear how the axial proteins are recognized by the export system since they have no cleavable signal sequences or any common signals at the primary sequence level [ 4 ] . 
The ﬂagellar export system shows close similarity to the family of type-III export systems [ 2,5 ] . 
The export substrates of type-III secretion systems do not contain cleavable signal sequences and they do not share common sequence motifs responsible for export . 
In the known cases they contain a segment of 15 -- 30 amino acids in the N-terminal region which directs exports [ 6 -- 8 ] . 
The recognition signal for ﬂagellar export also seems to lie within the N-terminal region of export substrates . 
Previous experiments made in Escherichia coli have shown that 
183-residue N-terminal fragment , which is just a little over one-third the size of the wild-type protein , can be recognized by the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc export apparatus and exported from the cell [ 9 ] . 
Information essential for hook protein secretion is also located in the N-terminal portion of the molecule [ 10 ] . 
Nonetheless , comparison of the sequences of the exported ﬂagellar proteins failed to identify candidates for the recognition signal at the primary sequence level , implying that recognition of a protein for export by the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc system may involve recognition of a structure at higher levels [ 11 ] . 
Terminal disorder is a common structural feature of the axial proteins of the bacterial ﬂagellum [ 12 -- 14 ] . 
The disordered regions assemble into helical bundles upon polymerization of ﬂagellar ﬁlaments [ 3 ] and belong to the most conserved part of these molecules . 
It has been speculated that this terminal disorder may serve as the recognition signal for the ﬂagellum speciﬁc export apparatus [ 13 ] . 
The objective of this work was to localize the export signal in Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin and to demonstrate the role of the disordered N-terminal region of the molecule in controlling recognition and translocation by the ﬂagel-lum-speciﬁc export machinery . 
Materials and methods
DNA constructs . 
Three N-terminally truncated ﬂagellins , consisting of the amino acids 66 -- 494 ( FliC66 -- 494 ) , 30 -- 494 ( FliC30 -- 494 ) , and 14 -- 494 ( FliC14 -- 494 ) , were made by mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene Phagemid kit from Bio-Rad ( discontinued product ) . 
These three DNA constructs , which contained the natural promoter-operator and ribosome-binding sequence , were placed into the pBR322 vector . 
FliC fragments corresponding to the amino acids 1 -- 192 ( FliC1 -- 192 ) , 14 -- 192 ( FliC14 -- 192 ) , 14 -- 99 ( FliC14 -- 99 ) , 14 -- 65 ( FliC14 -- 65 ) , 26 -- 47 ( FliC26 -- 47 ) , 26 -- 36 ( FliC26 -- 36 ) , and 37 -- 47 ( FliC37 -- 47 ) of S. typhimurium FliC were ampliﬁed by PCR using the proofreading advantage 2 DNA polymerase enzyme ( BD Bioscience Clontech ) and the full length ﬂiC gene template . 
The PCR products were gel-puri-ﬁed , digested with HindIII and BamHI enzymes , and were cloned into the pGFP expression vector ( BD Bioscience Clontech ) under the control of the lac promoter . 
The resulting constructs had the N-terminus of MTMITPSL followed by the ﬂagellin sequence . 
FliC1 -- 192 and FliC14 -- 192 were made in two versions one set had a stop codon after the ﬂagellin sequence , the other set , just like the other constructs , allowed to create fusion proteins using the BamHI site . 
The gene encoding CCP2 ( human C1r 375 -- 447 ) [ 15 ] was inserted in-frame after each of the ﬂagellin fragments . 
The CCP2 forward primers incorporated a BamHI restriction site while the reverse primers incorporated a stop codon and a KpnI site . 
Each resulting PCR product was gel-puriﬁed , digested with BamHI/KpnI , and ligated into the same sites of the ﬂagellin-pGFP plasmid . 
The resulting fusion constructs contained a 6 bp sequence between the ﬂagellin part and the CCP2 domain . 
All plasmids were sequenced to conﬁrm the desired DNA sequence and the correct reading frame . 
Electroporation , protein expression . 
The DNA used for electroporation was prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure . 
About 1 lg of circular DNA fragment was electroporated into the ﬂagellin-deﬁcient S. typhimurium strain SJW2536 [ 16 ] . 
The transformants were selected on Luria -- Bertani medium plates containing ampicillin . 
For each protein construct one selected colony was grown at 37 C in LB containing ampicillin to the late log phase . 
The supernatant was concentrated on 5 kDa cut-off spin concentrators and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate -- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting . 
In order to check potential cell lysis or leakage , we carried out Western blot analysis of cellular fraction and growth medium supernatant using monoclonal antibodies against the periplasmic maltose binding protein . 
SDS -- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting . 
The samples were separated on 15 % polyacrylamide gels , and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . 
The membranes were treated with 5 % nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with polyconal anti-ﬂagellin antibody raised in rabbit , or antihuman C1r antibody raised in goat provided by Bio-Rad ( C1r CCP2 containing samples ) . 
Signals were developed with alkaline-phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit/goat immunoglobulin G ( Sigma ) . 
Results
Secretion of truncated ﬂagellin fragments
To identify sequences essential for secretion of the S. typhimurium ﬂagellin protein ( FliC ) across the cell envelope , we constructed various deletion mutants of ﬂagellin . 
The role of the deleted segments in secretion was analyzed by testing for the extracellular accumulation of the truncated ﬂagellins by Western blot assay of the culture medium . 
Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin is a 51 kDa protein with 494 amino acid residues . 
The terminal regions of the ﬂagellin chain ( about 66 N-terminal and 44 C-terminal res-idues ) are unfolded in the monomeric form in solution [ 12 ] . 
In order to explore the contribution of the disordered Nterminal region of ﬂagellin to the export mechanism we constructed several deletion mutants designated as FliC66 -- 494 , FliC30 -- 494 , and FliC14 -- 494 ( Fig. 1A ) which lacked 65 , 29 , and 13 N-terminal residues , respectively . 
All three fragments had an intact C-terminus . 
These DNA constructs which contained the natural ﬂagellin promoter were introduced into ﬂagellin deﬁcient Salmonella SJW2536 cells , and protein expression was monitored . 
We detected the recombinant proteins by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-ﬂagellin antibody . 
Both the cellular and the cell culture supernatant fractions were analyzed . 
All three N-terminal deletion mutant ﬂagellins could be detected inside the Salmonella cells , while only the FliC14 -- 494 mutant appeared in the cell culture supernatant ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This means that all three mutant proteins were synthesized inside the cells but only FliC14 -- 494 contained the necessary signal for secretion . 
Truncation of 29 resi-dues , or more , destroyed secretion ability . 
A fragment containing only the N-terminal 183 residues of the 497-residue long wild-type E. coli ﬂagellin had been reported to be exported by the ﬂagellar export apparatus [ 9 ] . 
We constructed a similar deletion mutant of Salmonella ﬂagellin , the FliC1 -- 192 fragment , which comprised the ﬁrst 192 amino acid residues , and also the FliC14 -- 192 fragment which lacked additional 14 N-terminal residues ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The corresponding gene constructs were inserted into the pGFP plasmid under the control of lac promoter and the proteins were expressed in SJW2536 cells . 
In these and subsequent experiments we used the non-natural lac promoter to see whether the secretion signal lies in the N-terminal region of the polypeptide chain or the 50 untranslate region of ﬂiC mRNA is required to promote export , as has been suggested by Majander et al. [ 17 ] . 
Both the FliC1 -- 192 and FliC14 -- 192 mutants appeared inside the cells and also in the cell culture supernatant ( Fig. 2B ) . 
From the experiments with truncated FliC fragments we can draw the conclusion that the export signal in Salmonella ﬂagellin resides between Thr14 and Ala192 .

Directed export of CCP-fusions
Precise localization of the export signal required investigation of the secretion ability of small N-terminal fragments of ﬂagellin . 
To avoid dificulties accompanying detection and identiﬁcation of small fragments , we fused them to the 74-amino-acid long complement control protein 2 ( CCP2 ) module of human complement protein C1r [ 15 ] . 
This non-bacterial fusion partner is unlikely to interfere with the bacterial secretion systems . 
The fusion constructs were produced at the DNA level , expressed in SJW2536 cells , and the secretion ability of the fusion proteins was studied . 
Immunoblotting was applied to identify the recombinant proteins in the culture medium or in the cell fraction using antibodies raised against the CCP2 domain . 
The following constructs were designed and produced : FliC14 -- 192-CCP2 , FliC14 -- 99-CCP2 , and FliC14 -- 65-CCP2 ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The latter fusion contained a segment located exclusively within the disordered N-terminal part of ﬂagellin . 
DNA constructs encoding the fusion proteins were inserted into the pGFP expression vector , and protein expression experiments were carried out . 
As shown in Fig. 1B and 3 , all of these constructs were secreted into the culture medium . 
Secretion eficiency of fusion proteins was similar to that of wild-type FliC , producing protein yields of 10 -- 15 mg/l as estimated from Coomassie stained SDS -- PAGE of concentrated cell culture supernatants . 
In all cases , the periplasmic maltose binding protein could not be detected in the same culture supernatant preparations , showing that the presence of fusion polypeptides in this fraction was not a result of a bacterial cell lysis or non-speciﬁc leakage ( data not shown ) . 
Our observations clearly indicate that the export signal is situated in the disordered N-terminal region of ﬂagellin . 
Comparison of the N-terminal part of ﬂagellin sequenc-es from various bacteria shows ( Fig. 4 ) that the 26 -- 47 segment is highly conserved which implies important structural or functional roles . 
We checked whether the export signal is contained within this conserved region . 
The fusion protein FliC26 -- 47-CCP2 was constructed and found to be secreted into the culture medium with high eficiency ( Fig. 3C ) . 
The concentration of secreted FliC26 -- 47-CCP2 was 10 -- 12 mg/l in the culture supernatant . 
When the ﬁrst or second half of the highly conserved 26 -- 47 segment was used to create the FliC26 -- 36-CCP2 or FliC37 -- 47-CCP2 constructs , the fusion proteins remained inside the cell ( Fig. 3C ) . 
These experiments demonstrate that the 26 -- 47 segment is required for ﬂagellar secretion . 
Discussion
The most elusive part of ﬂagellar export is the recognition of export substrates . 
We attempted here to localize the export signal in S. typhimurium ﬂagellin . 
Using N-termina truncated fragments we demonstrated that the ﬁrst 13 residues are not essential for export , but removal of 29 or more residues destroys export ability . 
When various N-terminal fragments of ﬂagellin were fused to the CCP2 domain of human complement protein C1r [ 15 ] , the FliC26 -- 47 fragment was found to be the smallest segment of ﬂagellin which was suficient to cause secretion of the CCP2 module through the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc export pathway . 
Our results demonstrate that the 22-residue long FliC26 -- 47 segment contains the recognition signal for the ﬂagellar export machinery . 
Neither half of this segment was enough to direct export of the attached CCP2 domain , indicating that secretion of FliC26 -- 47-CCP2 is not a result of overloading the ﬂagellar export apparatus with a protein product overexpressed by a high copy number artiﬁcial plasmid . 
Recently Majander et al. [ 17 ] reported that N-terminal FliC polypeptides lacking the C-terminus were eficiently secreted when the corresponding gene fragments were expressed from the ﬂiC promoter , but remained within the cell when non-natural promoters were used . 
They concluded that the 50 untranslated region ( UTR ) of ﬂiC mRNA mediates secretion of ﬂagellin in E. coli . 
However , our results clearly show that the 50 UTR of Salmo-nella ﬂagellin gene is not essential for export and the polypeptide signal contains enough information to direct secretion of ﬂagellin or other fusion proteins . 
In our secretion experiments with CCP2 fusions , the non-ﬂagel-lar lac promoter was used without any natural upstrea or downstream DNA sequences of the ﬂiC gene , but the secretion eficiency of fusion proteins was very similar to that reported in Ref . 
[ 17 ] . 
Moreover , truncated ﬂagellin molecules having large N-terminal deletions ( FliC66 -- 494 and FliC30 -- 494 ) were not secreted even under the control of their natural promoter ( Fig. 2B ) and remained inside the cells . 
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of ﬂagellins from various bacterial sources revealed that the segment containing the export signal corresponds to the most conserved part of the disordered N-terminal region ( Fig. 4 ) . 
On the other hand , this segment does not show signiﬁcant sequence homology to the previously identiﬁed ﬂagellar export signals of hook protein [ 10 ] or the anti-sigma factor FlgM [ 18 ] . 
However , there are common features : all of the known signal sequences were mapped to the disordered N-terminal portions of the export substrates . 
It is worth noting that disordered terminal regions of all ﬂagellar axial proteins as well as FlgM show high propensity for formation of amphipathical helical structure [ 11,12,18 ] . 
It is tempting to speculate that the recognition process by the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc export apparatus is accompanied by inducing a stable amphipathic helical conformation in the largely different sequences of ﬂagellar export signals .
