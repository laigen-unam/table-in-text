Objectives : This study was aimed at characterizing the gyrA locus and determining its impact on fluoroquinolone susceptibility , DNA supercoiling degree and growth rate of Salmonella Typhimurium live vaccine strain vacT in comparison with its parent M415 . 
Furthermore , the role of multiple drug resistance efflux in the susceptibility of vacT to fluoroquinolones and macrolides was investigated . 
Methods : DNA sequences were determined for genes gyrA , gyrB , parC and parE of M415 and three consecutive mutants Nal2ori , Nal2passage and vacT . 
The impact of gyrA mutations on the fluoroquinolone susceptibilities and relative DNA supercoiling degrees was investigated by a complementation assay using wild-type gyrA ( gyrA ) and a reporter gene system , respectively . 
Doubling times of the strains and MICs of + different antibiotics in the absence and presence of an efflux pump inhibitor ( EPI ) were determined . 
Results : Besides the gyrA mutation D87G , two novel mutations ( G75A and A866S ) were identified in the three mutants and a third novel mutation W59R in vacT . 
Fluoroquinolone susceptibilities and DNA supercoiling degrees of all three mutants were reduced compared with those of M415 . 
Introduction of the gyrA + allele restored fluoroquinolone susceptibilities of the two intermediate strains to the wild-type level ; however , for vacT , MICs of fluoroquinolones were reduced below those of M415 . 
VacT had a higher susceptibility to macrolides and the EPI compared with M415 . 
Conclusions : The data point to a combination of at least one non-gyrA mutation and novel gyrA mutation ( s ) as the basis for the unusual fluoroquinolone susceptibility of vacT .

Introduction
Contaminated food from animal sources is a major cause of enteric salmonella infections . 
To combat zoonotic salmonella infections 1,2 the application of protective live vaccines for food-producing animals is a promising approach to reduce the risk of development of antibiotic resistance inevitably following antibiotic treatment . 
3,4 Several attenuated live vaccine strains of Salmonella have been developed either by random or by site-directed mutagenesis of genetic loci associated with basic metabolic pathways , but 5 only a few such strains have proven to be safe and effective . 
One example is the attenuated live vaccine strain ` TAD Salmonella Typhimurium vacT ' ( vacT ; Lohmann Animal Health , Cuxhaven , Germany ) licensed for use in chicken . 
Three genetic loci have been described for vacT which are thought to contribute to attenuation and/or to serve as epidemiological markers . 
However , their molecular basis remains to be elucidated . 
These loci include : ( i ) rtt ( reversion to tensid 6 tolerance ) , a poorly characterized mutation associated with increased susceptibility to macrolides ; ( ii ) rpoB , which encodes a mutated b subunit of RNA polymerase conferring rifampicin resistance to vacT ; and ( iii ) nalA , an allele of gyrA , which codes for a quinolone-resistant A subunit of DNA gyrase . 
A GyrA and a GyrB homodimer form DNA gyrase holoenzyme , a type II topoisomerase which , together with the topA gene product topoisomerase I , plays an essential role in maintaining a balanced superhelicity of covalently closed circular double-stranded DNA . 
For both rpoB and gyrA mutations , a reduction of fitness as an effect of antibiotic resistance have been described in Salmonella ( for review see ref . ) . 
Moreover , the accumulation of gyrA 7 mutations in laboratory mutants of Escherichia coli has been associated with reductions in DNA supercoiling degree and fitness , determined as growth rate . 
Thus , it is tempting to speculate that 8 gyrA mutation ( s ) play ( s ) a role in the attenuation of virulence and fluoroquinolone resistance of vacT . 
An additional factor contributing to quinolone resistance in Salmonella as well as in E. coli is the increased expression of the multiple drug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps . 
Among 9 these the tripartite RND-type efflux pump AcrAB-TolC , which shares high homologies to MDR efflux pumps in other enterobacterial species and consists of the MDR efflux pump AcrB , the membrane fusion protein AcrA and the outer membrane porin TolC , seems to play a major role in Salmonella . 
In vitro 10,11 mutants lacking either a functional acrB or tolC gene show reduced MICs of different antibiotics including fluoroquinolones . 
Moreover , in fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants , increased expression of acrAB genes was detectable together with target mutation ( s ) . 
However , so far no mutation affecting the regulation of either acrAB or tolC has been identified in clinical isolates . 
Instead , a soxR-constitutive mutation has been reported in a clinical isolate of Salmonella Typhimurium to be associated with a multiple antibiotic resistance ( mar ) phenotype including fluoroquinolones , but the underlying resistance mechanism in Salmonella has not yet been elucidated . 
In contrast , the susceptibility of vacT to macrolides 12 and fluoroquinolones is increased , suggesting a role of reduced efflux pump activity as an alternative or additional mechanisms leading to fluoroquinolone susceptibility . 
Recently , the rtt phenotype has been suggested to be associated with the cpxA locus coding for a global response regulator involved in the control of cell wall permeability . 
However , no DNA sequence data supporting this 13 hypothesis of a cpxA-mediated increase in fluoroquinolone susceptibility have been presented . 
Thus , the unique drug resistance phenotype of vacT showing low-level resistance exclusively to nalidixic acid while retaining susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has led us to investigate the role of target mutations .

Material and methods
Antibiotics
Antibiotics used were ciprofloxacin ( Bayer AG , Leverkusen , Germany ) , sparfloxacin ( Rhone-Poulene-Rorer , Cologne , Germany ) , erythromycin and clarithromycin ( Abbott , USA ) , obtained from the manufacturers , and ampicillin , kanamycin , nalidixic acid , norfloxacin , rifampicin and tetracycline , purchased from Sigma , Munich , Germany . 
Tylosin was a gift from Dr Stefan Schwarz ( FAL , Celle , Germany ) . 
Bacterial strains
Bacterial strains are summarized in Table 1 . 
These include Salmonella Typhimurium DT009 strain M415 ( obtained from Dr W. Rabsch , German National Reference Centre for Salmonella , Robert-Koch-Institute , Branch Wernigerode , Germany ) as the parent for the vaccine strain ` TAD Salmonella Typhimurium vacT ' ( Lohmann Animal Health , Cuxhaven , Germany ) and mutants Nal2ori and Nal2passage isolated in intermediate selection steps ( kindly provided by Dr J. Beer , University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany ) , as well as Salmonella ATCC 14028 . 
Single-step gyrA mutant M415-87 ( gyrA D87Y ) was selected from M415 on agar containing 0.125 mg/L ciprofloxacin . 
Recombinant plasmids used are summarized in Table 2 . 
All plasmids are derivatives of plasmid pPB507 , a broad-host-range vector based 14 upon plasmid RSF1010 . 
Plasmid pBP517 contains the wild-type 15 allele gyrA of E. coli . 
Plasmids pPHB94 and pPHB95 were derived + from plasmids pBP521 and pBP522 described previously by replacing 8 an 400 bp NsiI-fragment of the pBP507 part with an 2 kb PstI fragment . 
These fragments carry a gene fusion of the reporter gene luc for luciferase from Photinus pyralis with either promoter ptopA of topoisomerase I ( ptopA-luc in pPHB94 ) or promoter pgyrA of gyrase A subunit ( pgyrA-luc in pPHB95 ) . 
Susceptibility testing
The MICs were determined in the absence and presence of efflux pump inhibitor ( EPI ) phenylalanyl-arginyl-b-naphthylamide ( Sigma-Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany ) by a micro-broth dilution method in unsupplemented Mueller -- Hinton broth ( Difco , Detroit , MI , USA ) according to guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) either by using prefabricated microtitre plates ( Micro-16 naut-S , Merlin-Diagnostika , Germany ) or by manually preparing twofold dilutions . 
Owing to the strain-specific susceptibility to EPI alone , susceptibility tests for the different antibiotics were performed in the presence of EPI at 0.25 Â· MIC . 
Assuming a methodological variation in the MIC determination of -- 1 dilution step an MIC increase of > 1 dilution step determined in the presence of EPI was taken as an indicator for an active efflux system . 
For the complementation assay , susceptibility testing was performed in the presence of kanamycin at a final concentration of 50 mg/L to maintain selective pressure for the plasmids pBP507 and pBP517 . 
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing
Chromosomal DNA for PCR amplification was isolated by rapid boiling lysis . 
The primers used are listed in Table 3 . 
The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick-spin PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen , Duesseldorf , Germany ) . 
Cycle sequencing was performed in a total volume of 20 mL containing 4 mL of Ready Reaction Mix ( Perkin Elmer , Foster City , A , USA ) , 10 -- 100 ng of purified PCR product and 10 pmol of the respective primer . 
PCR products were loaded onto an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer ( Perkin Elmer ) for separation . 
Complementation assay
This test is based on the genetic dominance of the gyrA gene of a + quinolone-susceptible strain of E. coli over the respective quinolone-resistant allele gyrA from E. coli and many other Gram-negative 17 bacteria including Salmonella . 
Recombinant plasmids pBP517 14 ( gyrA ) and pBP507 ( vector control ) were transferred separately by + conjugational mobilization from an E. coli donor ( C600SN/RP1H ) to the respective Salmonella strain ( recipient ) . 
Transconjugants were 14 selected on M9 minimal medium containing glucose ( 0.2 % ) and kanamycin ( 50 mg/L ) . 
Supercoiling assay
The relative degree of supercoiling was determined as the supercoiling quotient Qsc defined as the luciferase activity determined for a strain 8 containing pPHB94 divided by that of the same strain containing plasmid pPHB95 . 
Thus , luciferase expression from plasmid pPHB94 increases with increased supercoiling degree , but decreases with reduced supercoiling degree from plasmid pPHB95 . 
18 
Doubling time
Stationary phase cells grown in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) medium were diluted 1 : 1000 and incubated at 37 C under agitation ( 225 rpm ) . 
Every 15 min , samples were taken for determining the viable cell count by plating aliquots of serial 10-fold dilutions on LB agar . 
IncQ , plasmid incompatibility group Q ; amiR , amikacin resistance mediated by an aminoglycoside ( 60 ) acetyltransferase ; genR , gentamicin resistance mediated by an aminoglycoside ( 200 ) adenyltransferase ; mob + , mobilizable by IncP plasmids such as RP1 . 
Doubling times during log phase were determined from the linear part of a semi-logarithmic plot of the number of cfu/mL against time . 
Results
Susceptibilities to different antibiotics
The vaccine strain vacT and its ancestors M415 , Nal2passage and Nal2ori were characterized phenotypically for their susceptibilities to different antibiotics . 
The results are summarized in Table 4 . 
Compared with its parent M415 , strain vacT has a reduced susceptibility to nalidixic acid and rifampicin , but is susceptible to ciprofloxacin , sparfloxacin ( Table 4 ) and many fluorinated quino-lones ( data not shown ) as well as to the macrolides erythromycin , clarithromycin and tylosin , the latter licensed for veterinary use ( Table 4 ) . 
The intermediate derivatives Nal2ori and Nal2passage have slightly reduced susceptibilities to sparfloxacin , but are fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin . 
For comparison , the single-step gyrA mutant M415-87 shows an increase in the MICs of nalidixic acid 
( four dilution steps ) , ciprofloxacin ( three dilution steps ) and spar-floxacin ( one dilution step ) , but not of macrolides or tetracycline ( Table 4 ) . 
The strains show different susceptibilities to the EPI ( Table 4 ) . 
Strain vacT is inhibited by 16 mg/L EPI whereas its parent M415 and mutant M415-87 are inhibited by 256 mg/L . 
Thus , for determining the impact of EPI on antibiotic susceptibilities under comparable conditions the inhibitor was used at 0.25-fold of the respective MIC . 
For the strains M415 , M415-87 , Nal2ori and Nal2-passage the presence of EPI resulted in reductions in the MICs of macrolides ( by 4 -- 10 dilution steps ) and nalidixic acid and cipro-floxacin ( by up to 2 dilution steps ) . 
The respective reductions for vacT were 3 -- 4 dilution steps ( macrolides ) , three dilution steps ( nalidixic acid ) and one dilution step ( ciprofloxacin and sparflox-acin ) . 
MICs of tetracycline were generally less affected ( Table 4 ) .

Identification of target mutations leading to quinolone resistance
Determination of the DNA sequences of the entire gyrA genes and 80 % of other quinolone target genes gyrB , parC and parE ( data not shown ) including the quinolone resistance-determining regions ( QRDRs ) revealed four gyrA mutations in vacT compared with 19,20 M415 : TGG!AGG ( W59R ) , GGT!GCT ( G75A ) , GAC!GCC ( D87G ) and GCG!TCG ( A867S ) ( Table 1 ) . 
In strains Nal2ori and Nal2passage only the last three gyrA mutations were detected . 
Mutant M415-87 contains a single gyrA mutation GAC!TAC ( D87Y ) . 
The DNA sequences of the QRDRs of the other target genes were identical in all strains . 
Complementation assay
Conjugational transfer of the recombinant plasmid pBP517 ( gyrA ) + into M415 and its mutants resulted in a reduction of the MICs of fluoroquinolones for all mutants compared with the gyrA-free control plasmid pBP507 . 
A gyrA allele in mutant M415-87 + restored the fluoroquinolone susceptibility of the parent M415 ( Table 5 ) .

Supercoiling assay
To investigate whether the accumulation of up to four gyrA mutations affects the supercoiling activity of gyrase , the global supercoiling degree of the DNA was determined for the different mutants by use of the supercoiling-sensitive luc reporter gene system . 
The results of the Qsc determination revealed a reduction of the Qsc of strains Nal2ori , Nal2passage and vacT to 60 % ( Table 1 ) compared with parent strain M415 . 
Qsc of mutant M415-87 was close to that of M415 ( Table 1 ) . 
Doubling time
The doubling times of three mutant strains investigated differed by factors between 0.5 ( Nal2passage ) and 3.1 ( Nal2ori ) ( Table 1 ) . 
In comparison with its parent M415 , vacT had a nearly twofold longer doubling time . 
Discussion
Use of attenuated live vaccine strain Salmonella Typhimurium vacT has proven to be an efficient measure to reduce the prevalence of contaminated food from chicken . 
In view of the increasing 13 incidence of quinolone resistance among salmonellae the presence of a nalA genotype in vacT might be a cause of concern . 
However , vacT displays an unexpected high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones similar to parent strain M415 , despite a reduced susceptibility to nalidixic acid . 
This resistance phenotype is reminiscent of a GGC!GAC mutation ( G81D ) mediating resistance to nalidixic acid , but not to fluoroquinolones , while all 21 known gyrA mutations within the QRDR including those affecting serine-83 and aspartate-87 result in complete cross-resistance to all quinolones in Salmonella . 
22 -- 24 DNA sequence analysis of gyrA revealed a combination of four mutations in vacT compared with M415 . 
These include two mutations outside ( W59R and A867S ) and two within ( G75A and D87G ) the QRDR . 
That a mutation affecting aspartate-87 is associated with quinolone resistance is known from single-step mutants of different Salmonella serotypes described by Hansen et al. , Reyna et al. and Griggs et al. and from mutant 22 24 25 M415-87 for the specific strain M415 ( Table 1 ) . 
The other three mutations are novel mutations . 
Considering the applied strategy of random mutagenesis to isolate vacT the accumulation of several 6 mutations in gyrA is not unexpected ; however , the complete lack of

mutations in > 80 % of other target genes gyrB , parC and parE including the QRDRs of any mutant strain points to a prominent role of the gyrase A subunit for the selection of vacT . 
While in highlevel fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of Salmonella a combination of specific target mutations affecting subunits A ( gyrA , parC ) of both DNA gyrase and topo IV , respectively , as well as subunit B of DNA gyrase has been reported , a combination of gyrA 14,22 mutations in a mutant showing increased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is new . 
The accumulation in fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of target mutations , such as those affecting S83 and D87 in gyrA , has been also shown to be associated with reduced DNA supercoiling degree . 
In multi-step gyrA mutants of E. coli concomitantly dou-26 bling time was prolonged and expression of type I fimbriae reduced . 
Another study reports reduced production of haemoly-27 sin in a nalA mutant . 
The DNA supercoiling degrees of mutants 28 Nal2ori , Nal2passage and vacT were 60 % that of M415 ( Table 1 ) . 
Thus , it is tempting to speculate that at least one of the three gyrA mutations in these mutants caused a reduction of the DNA supercoiling activity . 
The finding that the Qsc value of another single-step gyrA mutant ( M415-87 ) carrying a different gyrA mutation ( D87Y ) resembles that of parent M415 does not necessarily exclude a possible impact of the D87G mutation on the Qsc for the other three mutants . 
However , a reduced susceptibility to cipro-floxacin and sparfloxacin of Nal2ori and Nal2passage , but not of vacT , might point to a role as resistance modulator of the W59R mutation unique to vacT ( Table 4 ) . 
However , no obvious correlation between degree of supercoiling and doubling time was detectable in the present study . 
In complementation tests using the gyrA allele of E. coli the + susceptibilities to nalidixic acid , ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin are usually reduced to below wild-type levels . 
This was also detectable for mutants M415-87 , Nal2ori and Nal2passage ; however , for vacT MICs of fluoroquinolones were reduced below those of M415 . 
This could plausibly be explained by an additional mutation reducing the activity of an MDR efflux pump , the second factor determining the quinolone susceptibility . 
This view is supported by the low MIC of EPI ( 16 mg/L ) for vacT compared with the MICs for M415 and M415-87 ( 256 mg/L ) and the other two mutants ( 64 -- 256 mg/L ) ( Table 4 ) . 
These data point to a reduced expression level of functional efflux pumps in vacT compared with M415 . 
Results of the determination of MICs in the presence of EPI ( Table 4 ) are indicative of decreased outer membrane efflux : the amount of EPI required to reduce the MICs of erythromycin or clarithromycin to identical values differs between M415 ( 64 mg/L EPI ) and vacT ( 8 mg/L ) . 
This suggests that increased macrolide susceptibility , including the 16-membered macrolide tylosin , results from decreased outer membrane efflux in vacT . 
Thus , the increased susceptibility of vacT to EPI indicates a reduction in the intrinsic activity of MDR efflux pumps compared with its precursors , most probably explained by mutation ( s ) inactivating or down-regulating MDR efflux pumps of the RND-type , the preferred substrates of EPI . 
Among MDR efflux systems the AcrAB-TolC pump plays a role in intrinsic resistance of E. coli to macrolides and , if overexpressed , as an additional mechanism 29 leading to acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones . 
In E. coli 30 mutations affecting local or global regulators of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump have been shown to be associated with increased expression of AcrAB genes alone or in combination with a decrease of outer membrane porin ( OMP ) F , respectively . 
Accumulat-30 ,31 ing indirect evidence points to a similar role of AcrAB-TolC in multiple drug resistance in Salmonella too . 
From our experi-10 ,11 mental approach using EPI as an inhibitor of most RND-type efflux pumps we can not conclude that fluoroquinolones and macrolides are substrates of the same efflux pump . 
In contrast to E. coli , the marRAB operon of Salmonella has not yet been demonstrated to be involved in a fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype . 
Alternatively , alterations of outer membrane constituents ( porins , lipopolysaccharide ) have been associated with altered fluoroquinolone susceptibility . 
Compared with M415 , sequencing data did 31 not reveal an alteration in acrR of Salmonella vacT ( data not shown ) . 
Recently , a cpxA mutation has been suggested as a possible candidate leading to a reversion to tensid tolerance ( rtt mutation ) in vacT . 
However , supporting genetic evidence has not been 13 provided and the present study did not reveal a mutation in the respective gene of vacT compared with M415 ( data not shown ) . 
Probably , beside the rtt-associated mutation additional unknown mutation ( s ) introduced into vacT during random mutagenesis could account for the fluoroquinolone-susceptible phenotype of the gyrA mutant vacT . 
The data presented emphasize the importance of gyrA as a major factor contributing to the unique phenotype/genotype correlation of vacT characterized by a low level of resistance to nalidixic acid and a simultaneous wild-type susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and macrolides in the presence of a known fluoroquinolone resistance mutation gyrA D87G . 
Currently , different gyrA mutations are under investigation for their individual impact on the fluoroquinolone susceptibility and the supercoiling degree of vacT . 
A combination of additional novel gyrA mutation ( s ) with an as-yet-undetermined mutation associated with reduced efflux seems to explain additional characteristics of vacT , such as high susceptibility to macrolides , reduced doubling time and , presumably , attenuated virulence . 
A detailed understanding of the mechanisms leading to attenuation will be a step forward to the design of safe and stable live vaccines in the future .
