resulting in bacterial entry ( Galán and Curtiss , 1989 ; Hardt et al. , 1998 ; Fu and Galán , 1999 ; Zhou et al. , 1999a ; 2001 ; Zhou and Galán , 2001 ) . 
Translocation of these effectors requires SipB , SipC and SipD ( also known as SspB , SspC and SspD ) ( Hueck et al. , 1995 ; Kaniga et al. , 1995a , b ; Fu and Galán , 1998 ; Miao et al. , 1999 ) . 
Actin nucleation is facilitated by a number of actinbinding proteins and signal transduction molecules such as the Arp2/3 complex and CDC42 ( Tapon and Hall , 1997 ; Yarar et al. , 1999 ; Blanchoin et al. , 2000 ; Welch and Mullins , 2002 ) . 
There are three major families of actinnucleating proteins : the Arp2/3 complex , formins and Spire . 
Biochemical , molecular modelling and structural studies have determined that the Arp2/3 complex promotes actin nucleation by forming a dimer between the actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 to bind the slowgrowing ` pointed ' end of an actin ﬁlament ( Kelleher et al. , 1995 ; Robinson et al. , 2001 ; Taunton , 2001 ; Volkmann et al. , 2001 ; Pollard and Beltzner , 2002 ; Rodal et al. , 2005 ) . 
It is proposed that the formin family nucleates actin by forming homodimers with a ﬂexible linker to ` stair-step ' at the ` barbed ' ends of actin ﬁlaments , likely with the help of proﬁlin in vivo ( Li and Higgs , 2005 ; Kovar , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al. , 2006 ) . 
Spire has been found to nucleate actin through its four tandem WH2 domains to form a ` single-stranded ' actin polymer that initiates actin ﬁlament formation ( Baum and Kunda , 2005 ; Quinlan et al. , 2005 ) . 
Multiple bacterial effectors have been found to intercept and redirect actin dynamics to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton machinery ( Fu and Galán , 1998 ; Hardt et al. , 1998 ; Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Zhou et al. , 1999a , b ; 2001 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
For example , SipA decreases the critical concentration ( Cc ) for actin polymerization and increases the bundling activity of T-plastin in vitro ( Zhou et al. , 1999a , b ) . 
Further study established that SipA indeed functions to facilitate F-actin assembly to promote Salmonella entry ( Higashide et al. , 2002 ) . 
In another example , SipC nucleates actin ﬁlament assembly in vitro ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Hayward et al. , 2000 ) . 
Hayward et al. showed that SipC eluted at an apparent molecular weight consistent with SipC being a trimer by the size exclusion column . 
They suggested that the trimeric SipC might be responsible for its actin nucleation activity . 
We recently separated SipC 's actin nucleation activity from its effector translocation activity and demonstrated that the actin-nucleating activity of SipC

Summary 
Actin nucleation is the rate-limiting step in actin assembly and is regulated by actin-binding proteins and signal transduction molecules . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exploits actin dynamics by reorganizing the host actin cytoskeleton to facilitate its own uptake . 
SipC is a Salmonella actinbinding protein that nucleates actin ﬁlament formation in vitro . 
The molecular mechanism by which SipC nucleates actin is not known . 
We show here that SipC199 -- 409 forms multimers to promote actin nucleation . 
We found that wild-type SipC199 -- 409 forms dimers and multimers while SipC199 -- 409 # 1 , a nucleation mutant , is less efficient in dimer and multimer formation . 
Biochemical analysis suggested that SipC199 -- 409 might form parallel dimers in an extended conformation . 
Furthermore , a mutant Salmonella strain that was defective in forming the SipC multimer and deﬁcient in actin nucleation failed to cause severe colitis in a mouse model . 
These results allow us to present a model in which SipC forms multimers to promote actin nucleation . 
Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typh-imurium ) causes mild gastroenteritis and more severe systematic infections in both humans and domestic animals . 
It encodes a specialized type III protein secretion system that is required for bacterial invasion into epithelial cells ( Galán and Curtiss , 1989 ; Zhou and Galán , 2001 ) by inducing actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and membrane ruffles of host cells ( Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay , 1994 ; Ginocchio et al. , 1994 ) . 
Through the type III protein secretion system , Salmonella injects a panel of bacterial effector proteins to exploit the host cell actin dynamics

contributes to bacterial invasion ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
We also found that SipC is mostly monomeric in solution by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and analytical centrifugation assays ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
The molecular mechanism underlying SipC 's actin nucleation activity remains unknown . 
Here we present evidence suggesting SipC forms dimers and multimers to promote actin nucleation . 
Results
SipC199–409 forms dimers and multimers
Previous studies have suggested that either multimer formation or tandem actin-binding domains on a single protein are essential for actin nucleation activity ( Robinson et al. , 2001 ; Volkmann et al. , 2001 ; Romero et al. , 2004 ; Xu et al. , 2004 ) . 
We have shown that SipC199 -- 409 had actin nucleation activity and was monomeric in solution as determined by multiangle laser light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation assays ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
We also isolated a SipC199 -- 409 derivative ( SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant ) that lost its actin nucleation activity both in vitro and in vivo and remained active in its effector translocation activity comparable to the wild type ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
The SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant contained a 20-residue deletion and the M45-tag ( 18 amino acids ) epitope was inserted at residues 201 -- 220 ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
We hypothesize that SipC199 -- 409 exerts its actin nucleation activity through weak multimerization and the actin nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant may have lost its ability to form such multimers . 
Therefore , we examined wild-type SipC199 -- 409 and the SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant proteins using ( 1-Ethyl-3 - [ 3-dimethylaminopropyl ] carbodiimide Hydrochloride ) ( EDC ) , a commonly used zero-length cross-linking agent . 
When incubated with EDC , wild-type SipC199 -- 409 formed dimers and some multimeric species , whereas the actin nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) showed dramatically reduced levels of dimers and no detectable multimeric species ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The actin nucleation activity of recombinant wild-type SipC199 -- 409 and the nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) were checked by transmission electron microscopy ( Fig. 1B ) and pyreneactin assay ( data not shown ) . 
SipC199 -- 409 dimers nucleate actin in vitro and in vivo To further explore the contribution of dimer formation for SipC199 -- 409 nucleation , we made SipC dimers by introducing a single cysteine residue to replace an alanine residue ( A205C ) in wild-type SipC199 -- 409 , which has no cysteine residues . 
Dimer formation of SipC A205C 199 -- 409 is mediated by the disulphide bond when two cysteine residues are positioned in close proximity in the presence of CuPhe , an SH-oxidizing zero-length cross-linking agent ( Hunke et al. , 2000 ) . 
When SipC A205C 199 -- 409 was incubated with CuPhe , an adduct corresponding to the SipC A205C 199 -- 409 dimer was observed ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In contrast , GFP , which was puriﬁed in an identical manner and has two cysteine residues , did not form any higher-molecular-weight species ( Fig. 2A ) . 
We also did not observe any higher-molecular-weight adducts when the wild-type SipC199 -- 409 , which has no cysteine residues , was tested under identical conditions ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In addition , SipC A205C 199 -- 409 ( without CuPhe ) was fully active in actin nucleation ( Fig. 2B ) . 
To test whether the dimeric forms of SipC A205C 199 -- 409 are active in actin nucleation , we separated SipC A205C 199 -- 409 monomers from dimers . 
As shown in Fig. 2C , fraction # 13 contained primarily SipC A205C 199 -- 409 dimers , and fraction # 16 had mainly monomers , whereas fractions # 14 and # 15 contained both dimers and monomers . 
Equal protein amounts from each fraction ( 1 mM ) were tested for their nucleation activity . 
We found that fraction # 13 had the highest and fraction # 16 had the lowest activity , whereas fractions # 14 and # 15 had intermediate levels of activity ( Fig. 2D ) . 
This is consistent with the notion that the

SipC A205C 
199 -- 409 dimers are the active form in actin nucleation . 
To examine whether dimerization of SipC leads to F-actin assembly in living cells , we used the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) domain of c-Jun , a known dimerization module ( Halazonetis et al. , 1988 ; Riley et al. , 1996 ) , to enhance SipC dimerization in vivo . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , expression of bZIP-SipC - GFP resulted in punctuate 199 -- 409 F-actin structures that colocalized with bZIP-SipC199 -- 409-GFP . 
Expression of SipC199 -- 409-GFP without the dimerization module , or bZIP-GFP alone had no obvious effect on the actin cytoskeleton . 
The central region of SipC ( residues 201 -- 220 ) is essential for efficient SipC dimer formation in vitro 199 -- 409 
Our EDC cross-linking experiments indicated that the wild-type SipC199 -- 409 formed multimers and the actin nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant did not , suggesting that amino acids 201 -- 220 ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) might be essential for multimer formation . 
To investigate this further , we introduced a single cysteine residue to replace either alanine 268 ( A268C ) , alanine 339 ( A339C ) or alanine 399 ( A399C ) , in both the wild-type SipC199 -- 409 or the nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant protein , resulting in SipC A268C A339C 199 -- 409 , SipC199 -- 409 , SipC199 -- A399C , SipC # 1A268C , SipC A339C 409 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 # 1 and SipC199 -- A399C 409 # 1 respectively . 
We then tested their ability to form dimers and multimers in the presence of CuPhe . 
SipC199 -- A268C , SipC A339C and SipC A399C 409 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 were all able to form adducts corresponding to the molecular weights of SipC199 -- 409 dimers only in the presence of CuPhe ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The molecular weights of the observed adducts were further shown to be the size of SipC199 -- 409 dimers by size exclusion chromatography ( Fig. 4B ) and multiangle laser light scattering analysis ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Furthermore , SipC A268C , SipC A339C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 and SipC A399C are more efficient in forming dimers than the actin nucleation-deﬁcient mutant forms of SipC A268C 199 -- 409 # 1 , SipC # 1A339C and SipC # 1A399C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 ( Fig. 4A ) . 
Puriﬁed SipC A268C A339C A399C 199 -- 409 , SipC199 -- 409 and SipC199 -- 409 proteins all had wild-type levels of actin nucleation activity ( data not shown ) . 
Our data demonstrated that SipC A268C 199 -- 409 , SipC A339C A399C 199 -- 409 and SipC199 -- 409 were all capable of forming dimers , suggesting that the N-terminus , the middle and the C-terminus of SipC199 -- 409 are all in close proximity . 
One possibility is that SipC199 -- 409 forms a parallel-like dimer along the entire molecule leading to close contact at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of SipC199 -- 409 . 
This notion is consistent with our previous observation that SipC199 -- 409 is likely in an extended conformation ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
To test this hypothesis , we designed a mixing cross-linking experiment which allowed us to differentiate various forms of cross-linked SipC ( Fig. 5 ) . 
We ﬁrst created SipC A339C and SipC A399C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 with C-terminal M45 A339C A399C A339C tags . 
SipC199 -- 409 , SipC199 -- 409 , SipC199 -- 409 - M45 and SipC A399C 199 -- 409 - M45 all maintained wild-type levels of actin nucleation activity ( data not shown ) . 
We then mixed equimolar SipC A339C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 - M45 or SipC A399C-M45 with SipC A339C A399C 199 -- 409 or SipC199 -- 409 to examine the dimer formation by Western blot , with anti-M45 antibodies and Coomassie staining . 
As expected , SipC A339C 199 -- 409 , SipC A399C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 , SipC A339C-M45 and SipC A399C-M45 all formed homodimers ( Fig. 5 , arrowheads ) . 
When A339C A339C SipC199 -- 409 - M45 was incubated with SipC199 -- 409 or A399C when SipC199 -- 409 - M45 was incubated with SipC199 -- A399C 409 , additional bands were detected ( arrows ) , consistent with the presence of a heterodimer between A339C A339C SipC199 -- 409 - M45 and SipC199 -- 409 or SipC A399C 199 -- 409-M45 and SipC A399C 199 -- 409 . 
This lower band was not present A339C when SipC199 -- 409 - M45 was mixed together with A399C SipC199 -- 409 or when SipC A399C 199 -- 409 - M45 was mixed together with SipC A339C 199 -- 409 suggesting that A339C SipC199 -- 409 - M45 does not form a dimer with SipC A399C 199 -- 409 199 -- 409 and SipC A399C-M45 does not form a dimer with SipC A339C 199 -- 409 . 
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the N-terminus , the middle and the C-terminus of SipC199 -- 409 are in close proximity in an extended conformation .

The actin nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199–409#1 mutant induced less inﬂammation in a mouse model
Infection of streptomycin-treated mice with wild-type Sal-monella caused a signiﬁcantly reduced caecum and his-topathological changes in the caecum ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
We examined the ability of the actin nucleationdeﬁcient SipC # 1 mutant ( chromosomal mutation ) to 199 -- 409 induce such lesions in a mouse model . 
Mice infected with the wild-type strain or the complemented Mt # 1 ( psipC ) strain had slightly smaller caeca ( P = 0.09 ) ( Fig. 6A ) and severe caecum inﬂammatory lesions including luminal debris , epithelial desquamation , epithelial proliferation , neutrophilic inﬁltration in the mucosal crypts , and lamina propria , submucosal oedema , and neutrophilic and mono-nuclear inﬁltration in the submucosa and , occasionally , serosa ( Fig. 6B and C ) . 
In contrast , mice inoculated with Mt # 1 or the invG mutant had minimal or very small numbers of neutrophils in the mucosal lamina propria and submucosa and/no or minimal oedema in the submucosa ( Fig. 6B and C ) . 
Discussion
Eukaryotic actin nucleators promote the formation of an actin nucleus by either multimer formation or by containing multiple actin-interacting motifs . 
For example , the Arp2/3 complex forms a heterodimer between Arp2 and Arp3 , formin exerts its function through the tethered dimer of FH2 domains and Spire uses four tandem WH2 domains ( Kelleher et al. , 1995 ; Higgs , 2001 ; Marchand et al. , 2001 ; Pruyne et al. , 2002 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Zigmond , 2004 ; Baum and Kunda , 2005 ; Quinlan et al. , 2005 ) . 
SipC199 -- 409 , however , does not have any tandem motifs and apparently is mostly a monomer despite the fact that it eluted at an apparent molecular weight consistent with SipC being a trimer by the size exclusion column ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
We showed here that SipC199 -- 409 form dimers and multimers to promote actin nucleation , possibly by stabilizing the interaction between actin monomers . 
This mechanism is unique among the three known families of actinnucleating proteins : the Arp2/3 complex , the formin family and Spire . 
We showed that SipC199 -- 409 exists primarily as mono-mers ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) and the multimer formation is weak or transient . 
It is possible that the multimer formation may be enhanced/regulated during infection by other bacterial/eukaryotic factors . 
This regulation may facilitate the temporary nature of SipC 's activity as Salmonella-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangements are transient . 
This is especially important , as SipC is also required for the translocation of other type III effectors and its actin nucleation activity can not be downregulated by simply reducing the amount of SipC during entry . 
SipA was shown to enhance the actin nucleation and bundling activity of SipC in vitro ( McGhie et al. , 2001 ) . 
It is tempting to speculate that SipA might stimulate SipC 's actin nucleation activity in vivo . 
Furthermore , actin monomers were shown to be buffered by G-actin-binding protein ( s ) inside mammalian cells ( Cassimeris et al. , 1992 ; Romero et al. , 2004 ; Kovar et al. , 2005 ) . 
Actin nucleators alone were shown to have weak actin nucleation activities ( Higgs , 2001 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ) . 
Their activities are often increased signiﬁcantly when activated by corresponding signalling pathways ( Higgs , 2001 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ) . 
Further studies are required to investigate whether the actin nucleation activity of SipC can be increased by these signalling pathways . 
Previous study demonstrated that infection of the streptomycin-treated mice with wild-type Salmonella led to smaller caecum and histopathological changes in the caecum ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
Our animal experiment showed that mice infected with the wild-type or the complemented Mt # 1 ( psipC ) had smaller caeca and severe caecum inﬂammatory lesions while mice inoculated with Mt # 1 mutant exhibited little change in the caecum size and histopathology , comparable to that infected with the invG mutant strain . 
We conclude that the actin nucleation activity of SipC contributes to Salmonella-induced inﬂammation .

Streptomycin-treated mice were inoculated with 108 wild-type Salmonella ( Wt ) , the actin nucleation-deﬁcient SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant ( Mt # 1 ) , Mt # 1 expressing the wild-type SipC [ Mt # 1 ( psipC ) ] , or the invG mutant for 12 and 40 h. A. Weight of caecum 40 h post inoculation .

Groups labelled with different letters ( a , b and c ) within a time point indicate statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P < 0.05 , AVOVA ) among groups .

Inﬂammatory lesions ( including luminal debris , epithelial desquamation , epithelial proliferation , neutrophilic inﬁltration in the mucosal crypts , and lamina propria , submucosal oedema , and neutrophilic and mononuclear inﬁltration in the submucosa ) are most severe in the caecal tissues from mice inoculated with the wild-type Salmonella or Mt # 1 complement strain [ Mt # 1 ( psipC ) ] ( 134 ¥ magniﬁcation ) . 
No or minimum inﬂammation of caecal tissues is evident in mice inoculated with Mt # 1 or the invG strains ( 268 ¥ magniﬁcation ) . 
In summary , our data support a model of SipCmediated actin nucleation where the central region of full-length SipC ( residues 201 -- 220 ) and its multimerization plays important roles in the process . 
First , SipC199 -- 409 molecules fold in an extended conformation . 
Next , dimer and multimer formation through the # 1 region is initiated . 
Third , SipC199 -- 409 dimers/multimers nucleate actin . 
Although this model is supported by previous and current studies , many questions remain . 
We speculate that a co-ordinated cross-talk exists between type III secreted effector proteins and host proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics . 
Knowing how they converge to regulate the actin network will result in a much better understanding of the molecular events leading to Salmonella entry . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, mammalian cell lines and infection
Wild-type S. typhimurium strain SL1344 , the invG type III secretion deﬁcient strain and the actin nucleation-deﬁcient Mt # 1 strain ( ZP124 ) have been described previously ( Hoiseth and Stocker , 1981 ; Kaniga et al. , 1994 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
Chromosomal gene replacements were carried out as described before ( Kaniga et al. , 1991 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
Mammalian cell line HeLa ( CCL-2 ) and REF52 were purchased from the ATCC cell biology stock centre ( Manassas , VA ) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . 
Salmonella infection of mammalian cells was conducted as described previously ( Zhou et al. , 1999a ) at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 10 unless indicated otherwise . 
Infection of mouse was carried out as described ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) and was approved by the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee . 
At 12 and 40 h , caecum was weighed and ﬁxed in 10 % formalin . 
Histopathological evaluation was performed and pathological scores were assigned as previously described ( Coburn et al. , 2005 ) . 
The statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with Tukey 's multiple range tests .

SipC199 -- 409 derivatives with the M45-tag epitope were constructed with speciﬁc primers and the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . 
Desired sipC fragments were ampliﬁed by PCR and ligated into pBAD24 with a two-step cloning protocol ( Maniatis et al. , 1989 ) . 
SipC199 -- 409 was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-N1 resulting in SipC199 -- 409-GFP ( pZP1549 ) . 
The basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) domain of c-Jun ( Hu et al. , 2002 ) fused to SipC199 -- 409 was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-N1 resulting in bZIP-SipC199 -- 409-GFP ( pZP1547 ) . 
The bZIP domain was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-N1 resulting in bZIP-GFP ( pZP1745 ) . 
SipC199 -- 409 point mutant derivatives were constructed using Quick-Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . 
Expression , puriﬁcation and re-folding of wild-type 
SipC199 -- 409 and its derivatives were carried out under denaturing conditions as described previously ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
Actin assays
Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and labelled with pyrene ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . 
Fluorescence intensity was measured on a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Fluoromax-3 , Jobin Yvon , Edison , NJ ) with the excitation wavelength set at 365 nm and the emission wavelength at 405 nm . 
Pyrene G-actin and unlabelled G-actin were mixed at indicated ratios in G-buffer ( 2 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 0.2 mM ATP , 0.2 mM DTT , 0.2 mM CaCl2 ) . 
Polymerization was initiated by adding actin polymerization buffer from a 50 ¥ stock solution ( 100 mM MgCl2 , 2.5 M KCl ) . 
Effect of SipC on actin assembly was also examined by electron microscopy as described ( Zhou et al. , 1999b ) . 
Chemical cross-linking
Chemical cross-linking experiments were performed essentially as described previously ( Peters and Richards , 1977 ; Hunke et al. , 2000 ; Millan and Bubis , 2002 ; Samanta et al. , 2003 ) . 
Puriﬁed wild-type SipC199 -- 409 or SipC199 -- 409 # 1 mutant proteins ( 5 mM , ﬁnal concentration ) were incubated in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.5 ) , 100 mM NaCl in the presence or absence of EDC ( 0.78 mM , ﬁnal concentration ) and Sulpho-NHS ( 3.22 mM , ﬁnal concentration ) at 24 °C for 5 min . 
Reactions were terminated by SDS gel-loading buffer , and cross-linked species were analysed by Western blot with polyclonal anti-SipC antibodies . 
The Cu ( 1,10-Phenanthroline ) 2SO4 ( Cuphe ) disulphide cross-linking experiment was performed as described previously ( Hunke et al. , 2000 ) . 
SipC199 -- 409 ( 10 mM , ﬁnal concentration ) proteins with single cysteine replacement were passed over a Sephadex G-25 spin column ( Amersham Biosciences ) in the presence of 10 mM DTT for 6 h on ice prior to CuPhe treatment . 
Cross-linking was conducted with 0.78 mM CuPhe , 3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline in 20 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7.5 ) , 100 mM NaCl for 30 min on ice . 
Reactions were terminated by adding SDS gel-loading buffer containing 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide without reducing agent . 
Cross-linked species were analysed by Coomassie blue staining or Western blot with polyclonal anti-SipC or monoclonal anti-M45 antibodies . 
Size exclusion chromatography and multiangle laser light-scattering (SEC-LS)
The oligomeric status of wild-type SipC199 -- 409 and various mutants was tested by gel ﬁltration chromatography , using Superdex 200 16/30 column as described previously ( Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
Analysis of SipC using size exclusion chroma-tography and multiangle laser light-scattering ( SEC-LS ) was performed at the W.M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University , New Haven , CT , as described previously ( Folta-Stogniew and Williams , 1999 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) .
