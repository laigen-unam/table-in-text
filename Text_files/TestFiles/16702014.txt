Abstract 
Salmonellosis is one of the main causes of food-borne poisoning due to the consumption of contaminated poultry products . 
In the ﬂocks , Salmonella is able to persist in the digestive tract of birds for weeks without triggering any symptom . 
In order to identify molecules and genes involved in the mechanism of host resistance to intestinal carrier-state , two different inbred lines of laying hens were orally inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Bacterial colonization and host gene expression were measured in the caecum and its sentinel lymphoid tissue , respectively . 
Signiﬁcantly increased expression of chemokine , anti-infectious cytokine , bacterial receptor , antimicrobial mediator and particularly , defensin genes was observed in the line carrying a lower level of bacteria in the caecum . 
These innate immunity molecules were either constitutively or inductively highly expressed in resistant adult birds and thus present candidate genes to play an important role in the host defence against Salmonella colonization .

1. Introduction
Salmonellosis is a major cause of food-borne poisoning worldwide . 
In 2001 , Salmonella Enteritidis was still recorded as a major isolate associated with outbreaks due to the consumption of contaminated poultry meat , eggs and derived products [ 1 ] . 
After oral infection of fowls , the bacterial colonization is transient in the spleen , while durable in the gut , where the two caeca represent a reservoir [ 2e4 ] . 
Salmonella can be transmitted horizontally within the ﬂock after faecal shedding [ 5 ] as well as vertically through the trans-ovarian route [ 6 ] . 
The level of bacterial colonization is under genetic control [ 7 ] in either the young [ 8 ] or adult [ 9 ] avian host . 
As an alternative to the controversial use of antibiotics , vaccinal strategies and genetic selection of resistant animals to Salmonella carrier-state represent valuable and safe means of prevention that will beneﬁt from the knowledge of host resistance mechanisms leading to the control of the asymptomatic carrier-state . 
In mammals , receptors for bacterial motifs such as toll-like receptors ( TLR ) on epithelium and phagocytes have been involved in host response against Salmonella infection [ 10,11 ] . 
Elsewhere , the antimicrobial arsenal of phagocytes encompassing defensins [ 12,13 ] , inducible nitrogen monoxide synthase ( iNOS ) [ 14 ] and solute carrier family 11 member 1 ( SLC11A1 ) , previously known as NRAMP1 [ 15 ] , represents defence factors of mammalian host against Salmonella . 
In addition , immune regulators such as inﬂammatory chemokines and cytokines that may recruit and activate immunocompetent cells represent key factors in the resistance proces

[ 16,17 ] . 
In birds , a novel chemoattractant factor for hetero-phils ( equivalent to mammalian neutrophils ) called MIM-1 protein has been described in addition to IL-8 in host response to Salmonella infection [ 18 ] . 
Furthermore , IFN-g has been shown as a powerful activator of heterophils to ﬁght Salmo-nella infection [ 19 ] . 
This activation may lead to the production of defensins named gallinacins in avian species [ 20e24 ] . 
These gallinacins as antimicrobial peptides are powerful host components to eliminate bacterial pathogens [ 25 ] . 
All these innate immune components present valuable genes to be investigated in the resistance process of hens against Salmonella carrier-state . 
The aim of the present study was to document the expression proﬁles of immune response genes in relationship with host resistance to Salmonella carrier-state by comparing inbred lines of birds that differ in the level of Salmonella colonization [ 26 ] . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and experimental infection
Inbred lines 61 and 15I originally derived from stock provided by the USDA Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory ( East Lansing , MI , USA ) were reared in speciﬁc pathogenfree conditions of our experimental breeding unit ( INRA , Nouzilly , France ) . 
The absence of Salmonella in cloacal swabs was checked systematically in birds . 
Two separate groups of 21 laying hens from each line were orally inoculated at 30 weeks of age with 0.2 ml of bacterial suspension containing 10 colony-forming units ( CFU ) of Salmonella enterica sero-8 var Enteritidis strain 1009 [ 2e4 ] , which was streptomycin and nalidixic acid resistant , and were kept in a conﬁnement unit . 
Four uninfected animals from each line ( controls ) were sacriﬁced before inoculation and six to eight infected animals per line were sacriﬁced at 1 , 2 or 4 weeks post-infection ( pi ) by carbon dioxide inhalation . 
The spleen and one caecum were removed aseptically from each animal for quantiﬁcation of bacterial load , while the tonsil from the second caecum was collected for quantiﬁcation of target gene RNA , as previously described [ 27 ] . 
Experiments were complied with relevant national guidelines and institutional policies . 
Experiments have been performed twice and are shown separately for bacterial colonization results and cumulatively for gene expression results . 
2.2. Bacterial load measurement
The numbers of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in spleen and ceaca were determined . 
Brieﬂy , organs were homogenized in trypticase soy broth ( TSB ) and serial 10-fold dilutions were plated on salmonellaeshigella medium containing streptomy-cin ( 500 mg/ml ) and nalidixic acid ( 100 mg/ml ) . 
The number of colonies per plate was counted after a 48-h culture . 
The mean counts of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis CFU were calculated per gram of organ for each time point and for each line . 
2.3. RNA extraction and reverse transcription
Total RNA was extracted from caecal tonsil ( approximately 100 mg per animal ) , then treated by DNase I and ﬁnally reverse transcribed as previously described [ 27 ] . 
The cDNA obtained was stored at 4 C until use . 
2.4. Quantiﬁcation of cDNA by real-time PCR
The ampliﬁcation of cDNA was performed with speciﬁc primers of interest ( Table 1 ) and was measured by ﬂuorimetric real-time PCR method using a LightCycler instrument ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) by comparison to standard DNA plasmid constructs obtained as previously described [ 27 ] . 
In order to normalize the starting nucleic acid amount , the number of target cDNA was referred to 10 copies 7 of ubiquitin cDNA ( housekeeping gene ) in each sample .

2.5. Statistical analysis
Variance analysis with three factors ( time , line , experiment ) was performed on the log ( CFU ) measured in the spleen and in the caeca as well as on the log ( transcript copy number ) for each target gene . 
Since no interaction between line and experiment was observed , statistical analysis of gene expression was carried out on data from duplicated experiments ( n 1/4 14 ) . 
Signiﬁcant effect of line and/or time on gene expression was reported in the results section after checking that there was no interaction between line and time factors . 
In order to identify correlation between two gene expression proﬁles as well as between bacterial load and each gene expression proﬁle , the Spearman coefﬁcient ( R ) was calculated . 
3. Results
3.1. Bacterial colonization
Oral inoculation of laying hens with S. Enteritidis was followed by spleen and caecal colonization reaching a maximum at one-week post-inoculation ( pi ) in both local and systemic sites ( Table 2 ) . 
Despite the fact that maximal colonization level reached in each organ was dependent on the experiment , similar differences between lines were observed from both experiments . 
In the spleen , bacterial colonization appeared to be more transient in line 61 animals in which it was undetectable from 2 weeks pi , while it was still positive in 15I animals . 
In the intestinal site , a signiﬁcant reduction of Salmonella was re-corded in line 61 at 1 and/or 2 weeks pi according to the experiment by comparison to line 15I ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Moreover , at 4 weeks pi no bacteria could be detected in the caecum of line 61 animals while at least half of the animals in line 15I were still carrying bacteria . 
Thus , hens from line 61 appeared to be more resistant both to systemic colonization and to caecal persistence than hens from line 15I . 
In order to assess innate immune factors that could be associated to the resistance to Salmonella carrier-state , expression of relevant genes in the intestinal tissue was compared between these two lines . 
3.2. Gene expression
For all categories of genes studied , the baseline level of expression in healthy animals remained unchanged between 30 and 34 weeks of age ( data not shown ) . 
This allowed to exclude any effect of age on the modulation of gene expression over the time of infection . 
3.2.1. Chemotactic factors
In caecum lymphoid site ( tonsil ) of control animals , no difference in IL-8 gene expression could be observed between the two lines . 
However , after two weeks of infection this inﬂammatory cytokine gene exhibited a signiﬁcant difference of expression ( P < 0.003 ) between lines ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The high expression of IL-8 gene was related to line 61 resistance at two and four weeks pi when bacterial counts were signiﬁcantly reduced in animals from this line . 
Another chemoattractant factor gene called MIM-1 was also found to be 5e10-fold more expressed in the caecal tonsil of resistant by comparison to susceptible animals ( P < 0.02 ) , independently of the infection ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Knowing that both molecules are able to recruit heterophils at the site of infection , we were interested in measuring gene expression of LPS receptor TLR4 , inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) and SLC11A1 , which participate in the control of bacterial survival in phagocytes . 
3.2.2. LPS receptor and anti-infectious mediators
TLR4 gene was found differentially expressed between lines ( P < 0.01 ) and its expression was clearly induced one week post-infection in resistant animals , whereas it was increased one week later in susceptible animals ( Fig. 2A ) .

b Ratio of number of positive animals to number of inoculated animals 
Despite no signiﬁcant difference of expression of SLC11A1 gene between the two lines studied here ( data not shown ) , a slightly and constantly higher level of expression ( approximately 2-fold ) of iNOS gene was noticed in resistant animals , independently of the infection of birds ( P < 0.005 ) ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Knowing that TLR4 of phagocytes may signal danger to the host with help of regulatory cytokines and through the production of defensins , we have investigated the gene expression of such molecules in birds during infection . 
3.2.3. Cytokines
In caecal tonsil , no variation in the expression of IL-18 and IFN-g genes could be observed during infection ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Globally , the IL-18 gene displayed a higher level of expression than the IFN-g gene in both lines . 
However , both cytokines were slightly but signiﬁcantly more expressed globally in resistant birds ( P < 0.002 ) . 
3.2.4. Avian defensins
It can be observed that adult birds from the resistant line 61 exhibited a high baseline level of expression of both gallina-cins 1 and 2 genes ( Gal1 and Gal2 ) ( P < 0.01 ) ( Fig. 4 ) , which increased after inoculation in correlation with a reduced bacterial load . 
All the kinetics of infection considered , these avian defensin genes showed an approximately 10 times higher level in hens exhibiting the most resistant phenotype ( P < 0.0002 ) ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Expression of these two gallinacins was strongly correlated ( R 1/4 0.88 ; P < 0.0001 ) independently of the infection of birds . 
We have also found a strong correlation between TLR4 and Gal1 ( R 1/4 0.74 ; P < 0.0001 ) as well as between TLR4 and Gal2 ( R 1/4 0.64 ; P < 0.0001 ) , in relationship with infection but not with line . 
4. Discussion
In the present study , it was observed that adult birds from line 61 exhibited reduced colonization when compared to those of line 15I either in the spleen or in the caeca , consistent with the ﬁrst description of the resistant phenotype in young birds from 61 line [ 26 ] . 
These results are in agreement with those of Protais et al. [ 28 ] showing in laying hens a signiﬁcant difference between lines at 4 weeks post-infection . 
However , in a previous study on young animals , chickens from line 61 appeared to be more susceptible with a higher bacterial burden in the caecum than those in line 15I [ 27 ] . 
This suggests that mechanisms of resistance to caecal Salmonella carrier-state are different between young and adult animals , which is further supported by comparing resistance of outbred chicken lines at different ages [ 6,29 ] or estimated genetic parameters . 
An explanation in favour of the age-related phenotype is the maturation level of the immune system such as the gut-associ-ated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , which evolves from hatching [ 30 ] . 
In adult birds , the immune response gene expression needs , however , to be measured in relationship with phenotype in order to further document the effect of age on resistance and `` transcriptotype '' .

Quantiﬁcation of LPS receptor and antimicrobial mediator gene expression in the course of S. Enteritidis caecal carrier-state in hens . 
The levels of cDNA of TLR4 ( A ) and iNOS ( B ) genes in caecal tonsils from 61 ( dark histo-grams ) and 15I ( light histograms ) inbred lines of hens were measured by realtime PCR and expressed as the mean of the log ( copy number of target cDNA per 10 copies of ubiquitin cDNA ) SEM ( n 7 1/4 14 ) . 
A signiﬁcant effect of the line on TLR4 ( P < 0.01 ) and iNOS ( P < 0.005 ) gene expression was observed .

A signiﬁcant effect of the line on IL-8 ( P < 0.003 ) and MIM-1 ( P < 0.02 ) gene expression was observed . 
Our results showing a higher expression of chemokine genes in lower carrier hens are in agreement with those of Swaggerty et al. [ 31 ] showing a strong IL-8 response in heterophils from a resistant line infected in vitro by Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Both IL-8 and MIM-1 molecules are known to recruit heterophils at the site of infection [ 18,32,33 ] in agreement with the description of heterophil inﬁltration in the gut following bacterial colonization [ 34 ] . 
The observation of an earlier TLR4 expression in resistant birds is in agreement with previous results showing involvement of TLR4 in the genetic control of Salmonella infection [ 35e37 ] . 
This is also supported by the relationship between genetic resistance variation and bio-availability of a heterophil population [ 38 ] known to express TLR4 [ 39 ] . 
Although SLC11A1 has been suggested to be involved in the genetic control of Salmonella infection [ 35,36,40 ] and of Salmonella carrier-state in hens [ 37 ] , our results tend to exclude SLC11A1 involvement in the resistant phenotype . 
This discrepancy between positional and expressional data could be explained by a mutation in the SLC11A1 gene resulting in a non-functional transcript . 
However , the SLC11A1 gene encoding a phagosomal membrane protein has been mainly described as important in the control of systemic rather than intestinal infection of birds [ 36,40,41 ] . 
In the previous study realised by our group with young birds , a higher baseline level of expression of gallinacins 1 and 2 genes was found in line 61 that was , however , more colonised in the caecum than line 15I [ 27 ] . 
Thus , the high expression of gallinacins seems to be more useful in adult than in young birds to limit the gut colonization in line 61 . 
The high correlation observed between TLR4 and gallinacin genes strongly suggests a common cellular source , which could be heterophils or enterocytes for these two types of molecule . 
The contribution of intestinal defensins to mucosal immunity against infectious enteritis has been well documented [ 13 ] . 
Our results suggest that gallinacins could display an antimicrobial action in the gut of hens , by disrupting bacterial membrane permeability and leading to death of Salmonella [ 42 ] . 
Chemotactic activity of defensins described in mammals towards T and dendritic cells can also be considered in the intes-tinal defence [ 43 ] . 
This activity , if existing in birds , could be efﬁcient in adults , while inefﬁcient in young ones because of the immune immaturity of target cells . 
In conclusion , for nearly all the innate immunity genes studied , animals displaying a resistant phenotype also exhibited a clear increase in transcription level or a higher level of expression independently of the infectious status . 
These results are the ﬁrst demonstration that phenotype and `` transcriptotype '' are related to age , leading to a higher correlation between resistance and innate immunity in adult birds in contrast to young birds . 
This suggests that some innate immunity components may need maturation to be active . 
However , adaptive immunity can also be involved in the resistance process against Salmonella that will need to be investigated . 
Taking into account multi-gene and complex effects leads to considering more integrative studies , such as whole genome strategies
