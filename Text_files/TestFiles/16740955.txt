The ﬂagellin gene ﬂiC encodes the major component of the ﬂagellum in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-murium . 
This study reports the identiﬁcation of a signal within the 5 untranslated region ( 5 UTR ) of the ﬂiC transcript required for the efﬁcient expression and assembly of FliC into the growing ﬂagellar structure . 
Primer extension mapping determined the transcription start site of the ﬂiC ﬂagellin gene to be 62 bases upstream of the AUG start codon . 
Using tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions , we show that the entire 62-base 5 UTR region of ﬂiC was required for sufﬁcient ﬂiC mRNA translation to allow normal FliC ﬂagellin assembly , suggesting that translation might be coupled to assembly . 
To identify sequence that might couple ﬂiC mRNA translation to FliC secretion , the 5 end of the chromosomal ﬂiC gene was mutagenized by PCR-directed mutagenesis . 
Single base sequences important for ﬂiC-dependent transcription , translation , and motility were identiﬁed by using ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional and translational reporter constructs . 
Transcription-speciﬁc mutants identiﬁed the 10 and 35 regions of the consensus ﬂagellar class 3 gene promoter . 
Single base changes defective in translation were located in three regions : the AUG start codon , the presumed ribosomal binding site region , and a region near the very 5 end of the ﬂiC mRNA that corresponded to a potential stem-loop structure in the 5 UTR . 
Motility-speciﬁc mutants resulted from base substitutions only in the ﬂiC-coding region . 
The results suggest that ﬂiC mRNA translation is not coupled to FliC secretion by the ﬂagellar type III secretion system . 
Type III secretion ( T3S ) is one of several mechanisms designed to secrete proteins from the cytoplasm of bacterial cells . 
T3S is utilized in ﬂagellar construction and in the delivery of virulence determinants to eukaryotic cells by the injectisomes of gram-negative pathogens ( 13 ) . 
The ﬂagellum of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is composed of a rigid , helical ﬁlament of about 20,000 identical ﬂagellin subunits that extends up to 10 microns from the cell ( 26 ) . 
The ﬁlament is attached to an ion-powered rotary motor by the hook and rod structures of the ﬂagellar hook-basal body . 
The hook is a ﬂexible structure acting as a universal joint to transmit rotational energy from the motor to the ﬁlament ( 7 ) . 
The rod acts as the drive shaft , which penetrates through the peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide layers ( 20 ) . 
For the ﬂagellum , the T3S apparatus functions to secrete components including the rod , hook , and ﬁlament subunits for extracellular assembly . 
The core of the ﬂagellum is hollow , and secreted subunits polymerize at the tip of the growing ﬂagellum ( 32 , 35 , 36 ) . 
A cap at the tip of the ﬂagellum ensures efﬁcient polymerization of secreted subunit proteins ( 34 ) . 
There are three components that contribute to efﬁcient secretion by T3S systems . 
An N-terminal peptide secretion signal , disordered in structure , is absolutely required ( 27 ) . 
A T3S-chaperone is sometimes required for efﬁcient secretion of speciﬁc substrates . 
T3S-chaperones bind directly to their cognate substrates and act either to protect secretion substrates from proteolytic degradation in the cytoplasm , to facilitate the secretion of speciﬁc substrates , or both to protect from degradation and to facilitate secretion ( 6 ) . 
The ﬂagellar FlgN chaperone has been shown to bind directly to the secretion apparatus ( 33 ) . 
The third component of substrate recognition by T3S systems is an mRNA secretion signal and has been the subject of controversy for many years ( 15 ) . 
The type II Sectranslocase had been shown to target periplasmic and outermembrane proteins for export by a well-deﬁned N-terminal amino acid secretion signal ( 29 ) . 
The N terminus of T3S substrates was also required for secretion , but the lack of a conserved amino acid sequence in the N-terminal secretion signal led to the proposal of an elegant mechanism that the mRNA within the N-terminal sequence could be the secretion signal and that T3S occurred by a cotranslation secretion mechanism ( 4 , 5 ) . 
Our recent studies of the ﬂagellar assembly pathway of Sal-monella enterica serovar Typhimurium demonstrate that the efﬁciency of protein secretion through the ﬂagellum can be affected by the 5 untranslated region ( 5 UTR ) sequence of the mRNA ( 17 ) . 
This led to the model that translation of secreted ﬂagellar proteins might be localized to the cytoplasmic base of the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc secretion apparatus ( 1 ) . 
Since the ﬂagel-lin gene ﬂiC encodes the major component of the ﬂagellum ( 36 ) , we predict that efﬁcient FliC secretion is a strong candidate to be inﬂuenced by signals encoded in the ﬂiC mRNA . 
Therefore , we explored the possibility that the ﬂiC gene might contain regulatory signals in its 5 UTR region that couples at least transcription to translation . 
In the present study , we found that signals in the 5 UTR of the ﬂiC transcript were required for the efﬁcient assembly of ﬂagellin on the external surface of the cell . 
This suggested that sequences in the 5 UTR of ﬂiC might be required for targeting of the ﬂiC transcript to the ﬂagellum for localized translation . 
We set up a screen following targeted mutagenesis of the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene of motility-defective mutants . 
The motility-defective mutants were categorized as resulting in defects speciﬁc to transcrip ¬

tion , translation , or motility . 
The goal was to identify any potential mRNA targeting signals as sequences in the 5 UTR of the ﬂiC transcript that were speciﬁc to motility independent of transcription or translation . 
After an exhaustive screen and sequence analysis of hundreds of motility-defective mutants in the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene , no motility-speciﬁc mutants were found in the 5 UTR region . 
All motility-speciﬁc mutants were in the ﬂiC-coding region . 
A novel result that came from this study was the discovery of a potential stem-loop region in the 5 UTR that appeared to be required for ﬂiC translation . 
However , in a separate study , we show that this stem-loop structure in the ﬂiC 5 UTR functions to inhibit ﬂiC mRNA translation and that the mutants isolated in the present study enhance this translation-inhibitory activity ( 31 ) .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Media and standard genetic manipulations . 
Media , growth conditions , transductional methods , and motility assays were as described previously ( 10 , 11 ) . 
Strains containing the pKD46 plasmid were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with aeration in the presence of 100 g of ampicillin/ml ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) ( 9 ) ( Table 1 ) . 
The - Red genes were induced approximately 1 h prior to preparation of electrocompetent cells by the addition of arabinose to 0.2 % ( wt/vol ) . 
The expression of the ﬂiC : : MudJ and ﬂiC : : MudK constructs was determined by using X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ; 0.01 % ) MacConkey-lactose and tetrazolium-lactose indicator plates ( 18 ) . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
- Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate on mid-log-phase cells as described previously ( 23 ) . 
- Galactosidase activities are expressed as nanomoles/minute / ( optical density at 650 nm . 
Immunoblot analysis . 
Immunoblot analysis of FliC levels has been previously described ( 8 ) . 
All assays were performed in triplicate on protein samples taken from mid-log-phase cultures . 
DNA sequence analysis . 
DNA or PCR products were sequenced using ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits as described previously ( PE Applied Biosystems , California ) . 
The ABI BigDye Terminator reactions were run at the Biochemistry DNA Sequencing Facility , University of Washington , Seattle . 
Predicted RNA secondary structures . 
RNA secondary structures were predicted by using the M-FOLD program available online ( M-FOLD , version 3.1 [ 25 ] ; http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/ ) . 
We analyzed two different partial RNA secondary structures . 
One structure included the ﬂiC 1 translational start site and , 12 nucleotides ( nt ) downstream , the AUG start codon . 
The second structure included the ﬂiC 1 translational start site , the full length of the 
5 UTR ( 62 nt ) , and 42 nt downstream the AUG initiation codon . 
In the wild-type strain TH6232 the examined RNA total length was 77 nt for the ﬁrst structure and 108 nt for the second one . 
M-FOLD analyses were conducted at a ﬁxed temperature of 37 °C . 
Transcriptional start site mapping . 
The FliC primer extension oligonucleotide ( 5 - CAGGTTATTCTGGGTCAACAGCGACAGGC-3 ) , which is complementary to the promoter proximal end of the ﬂiC gene , was used to map the transcriptional start site . 
RNA was puriﬁed as previously described ( 12 ) from strains TH2592 ( ﬂjB5001 : : MudJ ) , TH2151 [ ﬂa-2039 ( tar-ﬂhD ) ﬂjB5001 : : MudJ ] , and TH3770 ( ﬂgM5301 ﬂjB5001 : : MudJ ) . 
Sequencing reactions were performed by using pJK124 as the template and the FliC primer extension oligonucleotide . 
Isolation of tetRA insertion/replacements of the ﬂiC 5 UTR sequences . 
The divergently transcribed tetR and tetA genes ( referred to as tetRA ) were ampliﬁed from a Tn10dTc insertion in strain TH2788 ( Tn10dTc inserted 89 bases upstream of the ﬂiY start codon and has no effect on motility ) with the primers FliCtetR ( 5 - CGGGGGAAGTGAAAAATTTTCTAAAGTTCGAAATTCAGGTTTAA GACCCACTTTCA-3 ) and FliC ( start ) tetA ( 5 - AACAGCGACAGGCTGTTT GTATTAATGACTTGTGCCATGACTAAGCACTTGTCTCC-3 ) , with FliCtetR and FliC ( SD ) tetA ( 5 - GGCTGTTTGTATTAATGACTTGTGCCATGATCTT TTCCTTCTAAGCACTTGTCTCCTG-3 ) and with FliCtetR and FliC 1/tetA ( 5 - CTTGATGTTATTGGGCTGTTGCCCACGGTTTCTCACCGTCTAAGC ACTTGTCTCCTG-3 ) . 
These ampliﬁed fragments were introduced into strain TH714 expressing the - Red recombination functions from plasmid pKD46 by electroporation , selecting for tetracycline resistance . 
The primers are ﬂanked by ﬂiC sequence such that selection of the ﬂiC-ﬂanked tetRA sequences resulted in the replacement of the 10 region of the ﬂiC promoter to sites 2 ( ﬂiC5533 : : tetRA ) , 12 ( ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ) , or 62 ( ﬂiC5569 : : tetRA ) bases upstream of the ATG start codon , resulting in tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions with 2 , 12 , or 62 bases of the ﬂiC 5 UTR between tetA and ﬂiC ( Fig. 1 ) . 
For simplicity , these three constructs are described from here on as PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , and PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 . 
Localized mutagenesis of the ﬂiC promoter-UTR region . 
Three primers were designed for the doped mutagenesis of the ﬂiC 5 UTR region ( MWG Biotech ) : primer ﬂiC1 ( 5 - ACCAGGGTTAcggtgagaaaccgtgggcaaCAGCC-3 , primer ﬂiC2 ( 5 - GGGCAAcagcccaataacataacatcaagttGTAATT-3 ) , and primer ﬂiC3 ( 5 - CA AGTTgtaattgataaggaaaagatcATGGCA-3 ) , in which the lowercase bases were doped with 1 % of each of the other three bases ( Fig. 2A ) . 
These were used to amplify sequences 3 to the 5 UTR with the primer ﬂiC / ﬂjB13 ( 5 - CGCTGCA GGTTGTTGTTG-3 ) , located about 250 bases into the ﬂiC structural gene . 
The ampliﬁed fragments were cleaned up with a QIAGEN PCR puriﬁcation kit and used as the second primer to amplify sequences 5 to the 5 UTR with the primer ﬂiC13 ( 5 - GTTCTTTGTCAGGTCTGTC-3 ) , located about 250 bases upstream of ﬂiC ( 60 bases within the ﬂiD structural gene ) ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The resulting fragments ( FliC-1 , FliC-2 , and FliC-3 ) were cleaned up with a QIAGEN PCR puriﬁcation kit and contained mutagenized ﬂiC 5 - UTR sequences ﬂanked by about 272 ( 3 ) and 280 ( 5 ) bases of homology to allow for recombination . 
In the ﬁrst set of mutagenesis , these donor fragments were electroporated separately into strains TH6303 , TH6305 , and TH6307 , selecting for tetracycline sensitivity ( 24 ) ( Fig. 2B ) , whereas for three further rounds of mutagenesis only TH6303 was s used . 
The tetracycline-sensitive ( Tc ) electroporants were screened for Mot . 
These - Red-mediated recombination events resulted in the replacement of the ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA insertion with the mutagenized ﬂiC 5 UTR ( Fig. 2B ) . 
To isolate motile revertants of the nonmotile ﬂiC : : tetRA insertions , 20 independent colonies from TH4754 ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 ) and 22 from TH4753 ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 ) were stabbed into motility agar and incubated at 37 °C . 
These strains possess an insertion in the alternative ﬂagellin ﬂjB to ensure that a motile phenotype is due to ﬂiC-dependent motility . 
After overnight incubation , motile revertants were picked and puriﬁed by two successive single colony isolations on nonselective LB plates and retested for motility . 
The PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 deletion-insertion mutations were then transduced into a wildtype background . 
Introduction of ﬂiC . 
MudJ and ﬂiC : : MudK insertions downstream of ﬂiC 5 UTR mutant alleles . 
The ﬂiC5747 : : Tn10dTc insertion is located near the 5 end of the ﬂiC coding region after bp 79 from the translational start site of ﬂiC ( Fig. 2C ) . 
ﬂiC : : MudJ transcriptional ( 11 ) and ﬂiC : : MudK ( 8 ) translational reporters were introduced into strain TH6705 ( ﬂiC5747 : : Tn10dTc ) by P22 generalized transduction , selecting Mud-encoded Kmr and screening Tcr to generate TH6699 ( ﬂiC5747 : : Tn10dTc ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ) and TH6700 ( ﬂiC5747 : : Tn10dTc ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ) , respectively . 
TH6699 and TH6700 were then used as donors in P22-mediated transductions into the Mot mutants generated by directed mutagenesis of the ﬂiC 5 UTR region selecting for kanamycin-resistant ( Kmr ) and screening for Tcs by replica printing the L-Km selection plates onto Tcs selection plates containing Km ( to hold selection ) ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Because the Mud insertion are located in the 3 half of the ﬂiC structural gene and the Tn10dTc is located near the 5 end of the ﬂiC structural gene , Kmr Tcs transductants must occur by recombination ( see Fig. 2C ) between the points of insertion of the Mud and Tn10dTc transposons so that the ﬂiC 5 UTR mutant region of the recipient remains in the recombinant . 
Two Kmr Tcs transductants were kept from each cross and examined on indicator media for lac expression . 
Targeted mutagenesis of a stem-loop region in the ﬂiC 5 UTR region . 
The double mutant 45G : C 38C : G was constructed by the PCR-based technique of GenSOEing ( 2 ) . 
Primers ﬂiC / ﬂjB13 and ﬂiC13 were used as `` outside '' primers ( Fig. 2A ) with the internal primers FliCUTRSL2GCF ( 5 - AGAAACCGTGGCCAACA GGCCAATAACATC-3 ) and FliCUTRSL2GCR ( 5 - GATGTTATTGGCCTGTT GGCCACGGTTTCT-3 ) , respectively , for a ﬁrst round of PCR with LT2 DNA as a template . 
The resulting PCR products were puriﬁed with the QIAGEN PCR clean-up kit and used in a second round of PCR with templates mixed at approximately a 1:1 ratio . 
The primers for the second round were only ﬂiC / ﬂjB13 and ﬂiC13 . 
This generated a 622-bp PCR product that was isolated from a 1 % agarose gel and used to replace the ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA allele in TH6303 by - Red recombination ( Fig. 2B ) . 
As internal controls , the single mutations 38C : G and 45G : C were created by using the internal primers FliCUTRSL2GF ( 5 - AGAAACCGTGGGCAACAG GCCAATAACATC-3 ) , FliCUTRSL2GR ( 5 - GATGTTATTGGCCTGTTGCCC ACGGTTTCT-3 ) , FliCUTRSL2CF ( 5 - AGAAACCGTGGCCAACAGCCCAAT AACATC-3 ) , and FliCUTRSL2CR ( 5 - GATGTTATTGGGCTGTTGGCCACG GTTTCT-3 ) . 
All mutations were conﬁrmed by phenotypic and DNA sequence analysis .

FIG. 1 . 
Explanation of the strategy used to create tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions at the ﬂiC chromosomal locus . 
The tetR-tetA region from transposon Tn10dTc was ampliﬁed with primers whose 5 sequences were homologous to the sites of insertion in ﬂiC and whose 3 sequences were homologous to the ends of either tetR or tetA . 
After ampliﬁcation , tetRA fragments ﬂanked by 40 bases of ﬂiC sequences were recombined into the chromosome by - Red recombination as described previously ( 9 ) . 
For all three constructs the 5 recombination site is identical , replacing the 5 end of the 10 sequence of the ﬂiC promoter ( 5 - GCCGATAC-3 ) , whereas the 3 recombination site varied ( recombinations A , B , or C ) depending on how much of the ﬂiC transcript was still present . 
The PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 construct resulting from recombination A , also known as ﬂiC5533 : : tetRA , deletes the ﬂiC promoter and 5 UTR through to base 3 before the ﬂiC AUG codon with the tetRA cassette . 
For PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , the allele , ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA , required recombination B and is a tetRA replacement starting at the same point as for ﬂiC5533 : : tetRA , but this time through to base 13 before the ﬂiC AUG codon . 
For PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 , the 3 end point of the allele , ﬂiC5569 : : tetRA , resulting from recombination C is at base 62 before the ﬂiC AUG codon . 
For visualization of the resulting transcripts from these tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions , the tetA transcript is shown in light gray and the ﬂiC transcript is dark gray . 
RESULTS
The ﬂiC transcriptional start site . 
As a ﬁrst step in the characterization of the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene , the transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
RNA samples were isolated from wild-type and ﬂhDC and ﬂgM mutant strains and used to determine the start of transcription . 
The ﬂhDC operon is required for all ﬂagellar gene expression and thus serves as a negative control ( 19 ) . 
FlgM is an inhibitor of 28-dependent ﬂiC transcription ( 28 ) . 
A null mutation in ﬂgM results in increased 28-dependent transcription and represents a positive control . 
The results of the primer extension analysis are shown in Fig. 3 . 
No primer extension product was observed in the ﬂhDC control strain , and products were increased in the ﬂgM mutant strain . 
We observed adjacent transcriptional start sites 63 ( T ) and 62 ( A ) bases upstream of the initiator AUG codon , with the majority of the transcription starting at 62 ( A ) relative to the AUG ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These start sites correspond to 1 and 12 bases downstream from the center of the 10 region of a deduced ﬂiC promoter based on the consensus 28-depen-dent ﬂagellar promoter sequence ( 14 ) . 
This veriﬁes that the ﬂiC promoter identiﬁed by its strong consensus sequence for 
28 promoters ( 14 ) and position upstream of the ﬂiC coding region is , in fact , the ﬂiC promoter . 
Effect of ﬂiC 5 UTR sequence on ﬂiC expression from tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions . 
Previous data show that ﬂiC expression is regulated at both the transcriptional level and the translational level ( 8 ) . 
The identiﬁcation of a 62-bp 5 UTR in the ﬂiC transcript by promoter mapping leads to the prediction that the ﬂiC 5 UTR may be required not only for the transcription and translation of ﬂiC but for the proper assembly of FliC subunits into the external ﬁlament structure . 
To test this possibility , the ﬂiC promoter and 5 UTR region were replaced with the tetA promoter at the ﬂiC chromosomal locus ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Recent advances using the bacteriophage recombination system ( - Red ) has allowed for the construction of precise , targeted changes in the bacterial chromosome using homologies of as little as 30 bp ( 9 , 37 ) . 
A segment of DNA containing the divergently transcribed tetR and tetA genes from transposon Tn10 , hereafter referred to as tetRA , was recombined into the ﬂiC promoter region , resulting in three insertion-deletion constructs ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , and PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The deletion constructs all have the same upstream endpoint and remove the 10 sequence of the ﬂiC promoter , while the downstream deletion endpoints vary and are either 2 bases prior to the AUG ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 ) , 12 bases prior to the AUG ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 ) , or just prior to the 1 position of the ﬂiC transcript ( PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The tetA gene prod uct confers resistance to tetracycline and is repressed by the TetR repressor . 
In the presence of tetracycline , TetR no longer represses . 
Thus , these constructs place the ﬂiC gene under the control of the tetA promoter , which is induced by the addition of tetracycline . 
We have effectively created tetA-ﬂiC operons at the ﬂiC locus such that ﬂiC transcription is induced by the addition of tetracycline to the growth medium . 
The three PﬂiC : : tetRA constructs were placed upstream of either a ﬂiC-lac transcriptional ( operon ) fusion construct , a ﬂiC-lacZ translational ( gene ) fusion construct , or the wild-type ﬂiC structural gene . 
Transcription , translation , FliC protein levels , and motility were then analyzed after induction of the PﬂiC : : tetRA constructs by tetracycline ( Fig. 4 ) . 
No construct produced ﬂiC expression comparable to the wild type , although PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 did have a motile phenotype . 
The differences in ﬂiC expression can in part be explained by the fact that ﬂiC is now in a multicistronic operon with tetA . 
For ﬂiC transcription , PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 had a 1.4-fold reduction in transcription compared to the wild type , while PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 were reduced 4.3 - and 3.1-fold , respectively ( Fig. 4 : ﬂiC-lac ) . 
A much stronger effect was observed for ﬂiC translation . 
For PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , a 167-fold reduction in ﬂiC translation was observed , presumably resulting from the lack of a deﬁned ribosomal binding site in the tetA-ﬂiC intergenic region ( Fig. 4 , ﬂiC-lacZ ) . 
The construct PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 also showed a much stronger decrease in translation ( 55-fold ) compared to transcription , but here the native ribosomal binding site region was included . 
These results are consistent with previous ﬁndings that showed regulation of ﬂiC translation is stronger than that exhibited at the transcriptional level ( 8 ) . 
Upon comparison of intracellular FliC protein levels , PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 produced signiﬁcantly less FliC than PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 did not produce FliC ( data not shown ) , which was consistent with the translation results ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Only PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 containing the full-length 5 UTR of ﬂiC was able to assemble enough FliC subunits to produce motility . 
These data suggested that FliC could be produced independently of the ﬂiC promoter and 5 UTR , but sequences in the 5 UTR are important for ﬂiC translation and possibly for secretion and assembly into external ﬁlaments . 
Analysis of motile revertants of PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 constructs . 
The low level of ﬂiC-lacZ translation observed for both the PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and the PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 constructs suggests that ribosomes do not bind this region effectively . 
It is possible that the entire ribosome binding site is not included in the 12 bases immediately preceding the ﬂiC AUG start codon

Strategies used for the isolation and characterization of mutants in the 5 region of the ﬂiC gene . 
( A ) PCR strategies used during the isolation of random and targeted ﬂiC 5 UTR mutants . 
The outside prim-ers ﬂiC / ﬂjB13 and ﬂiC13 stayed consistent throughout all mutagenesis . 
Internal primers were either doped ( ﬂiC1 , ﬂiC2 , and ﬂiC3 ) or possessed speciﬁcally designed mutations leading to the double 45G : C 38C : G mutant . 
( B ) The generation of mutants in the 5 region of the ﬂiC gene was carried out by replacement of the PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 ( ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ) allele with a PCR-mutagenized DNA fragment covering this region and selecting Tcs recombinants in the presence of the - Red recombinase . 
( C ) Motility-defective mutants in the 5 region of the ﬂiC gene were screened for effects on expression of a lac transcriptional or translational reporter by recombining in either a ﬂiC : : MudJ ( transcriptional reporter ) or a ﬂiC : : MudK ( translational reporter ) located downstream in the ﬂiC gene . 
Because the donor ﬂiC : : Mud strains also have an upstream ﬂiC : : Tn10dTc insertion , selection for Mud-encoded Kmr and screening for retention of the Tcs recipient genotype ensures that the motility-defective mutation is retained in the recombinants . 
FIG. 4 . 
Effect of ﬂiC 5 UTR sequences in tetA-ﬂiC operon fusions on transcription , translation , and assembly . 
The three ﬂiC 5 UTR tetRA replacements described in Fig. 1 were used to determine the extent to which the 5 UTR is required for ﬂiC expression and assembly into the ﬂagellar ﬁlament . 
The four columns represent the ﬂiC transcription and translation levels , the intracellular concentration of FliC , and the motility of all three constructs compared to wild-type . 
No tetA-ﬂiC operon fusion possessed a ﬂiC expression proﬁle comparable to the wild type . 
PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 had very little translational activity leading to low levels of the FliC protein , and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 had just a bit more . 
The PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 construct was translated at high levels and possessed signiﬁcant levels of FliC . 
The PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 possessed a nonmotile phenotype compared to the wild type and PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 .

For ﬂiC-lacZ translation : wild type , TH5951 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ] ; PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , TH6301 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5533 : : tetRA ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ] ; PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , TH6295 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ] ; and PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 , TH6782 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5569 : : tetRA ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ] . 
For FliCIN and motility : wild type , TH5947 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ] ; PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , TH6297 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5533 : : tetRA ] ; PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , TH6291 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ] ; and PﬂiC : : tetRA-62 , TH6111 [ hin-5717 : : FRT-Cm-FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5569 : : tetRA ] . 
The recommended strong ribosome binding site for E. coli is UAAGGAAG ( 30 ) . 
Our construct included the sequence AAG GAAAAAGAUC and lacked the U that is present normally at position 13 relative to the AUG start codon , which may have been important for ﬂiC translation . 
We isolated and characterized motile revertants of the PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 constructs to see what changes would restore ﬂiC mRNA translation and motility . 
Of 42 motile revertants analyzed , 12 of 20 from PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 parent strain and 13 of 22 from the PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 parent strain showed 100 % linkage of Tcr to motility . 
The 25 revertants showing 100 % linkage were sequenced for the entire tetRA region through the ﬁrst 30 bases of ﬂiC . 
The results are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 5 . 
For PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 , only 8 of the 12 mutants had sequence changes in the region sequenced , resulting in ﬁve different mutations ( Fig. 5A ) . 
In this construct , the AUG start codon is within the stem of a potential stem-loop structure , and six of the eight sequenced changes would result in a disruption of the stem . 
Another mutation , isolated twice , was due to a C-to-A ( C : A ) substitution 46 bases upstream of the tetA stop codon and was significantly more motile than the other revertants , but it is not clear how this substitution affects ﬂiC translation . 
For PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 , of the 13 revertants , sequence analysis identiﬁed 7 individual mutations ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Four deletions allow readthrough into ﬂiC , resulting in a stop codon starting at base 15 of the ﬂiC coding sequence . 
One insertion of 26 bases allows readthrough ending at a stop codon starting at base 38 of the ﬂiC coding sequence . 
The other two resulted in G : U substitutions , one of which was 10 bases upstream of the tetA stop codon and the other was the base for ﬂiC codon 2 , resulting in an A2S amino acid substitution . 
All increased ﬂiC translation and presumably increase ribosome binding upstream of ﬂiC . 
One of the motile revertants from the P : : tetRA-12 con-ﬂiC struct , resulting in a G : U substitution 10 bases upstream of the tetA stop codon , showed weak motility and was used to select for secondary mutations that increased its motility . 
From 20 independent colonies stabbed into motility-Tc plates , 12 independent motile revertants were isolated , and 9 were characterized by DNA sequencing . 
One had no change in the region sequenced ; an A : G change 7 bases upstream of the ﬂiC AUG start codon was isolated twice ; four base substitutions of either G : U ( twice ) or G : A ( twice ) at position 4 in the ﬂiC coding region resulting in A2S and A2T amino acid changes , respectively ; and an A : U base substitution at position 6 in the ﬂiC coding region resulting in no amino acid change was isolated twice ( Fig. 5B [ in parentheses ] ) . 
Isolation and characterization of mutants in the 5 end of the ﬂiC ﬂagellin gene . 
The sequence analysis of motile revertants of the PﬂiC : : tetRA-2 and PﬂiC : : tetRA-12 constructs were consistent with the mechanism that ribosomes do not bind upstream of the ﬂiC gene effectively in these constructs . 
However , it was recently reported that the 5 - and 3 UTRs of the ﬂiC gene in combination would target foreign proteins for secretion through the ﬂagellum independent of the FliC amino acid secretion signal ( 21 ) . 
We decided to target the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene and determine by mutant analysis sequences critical for transcription , translation , and assembly . 
For this analysis it was necessary to develop a two-step genetic screen ( Fig. 2 ) . 
First , mutants were isolated and screened for motility defects ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Second , nonmotile mutants were further screened with Mud-lac transcriptional and translational reporter constructs in ﬂiC ( Fig. 2C ) in order to categorize the mutants according to those affecting transcription , translation , or motility . 
Our mutagenesis strategy for the 5 UTR region used doped oligonucleotides and is outlined in Fig. 2A ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
The resulting 622-bp mutagenized DNA fragment including the doped ﬂiC 5 UTR and ﬂanking regions was recombined onto the chromosome under - Red induction conditions using the plasmid pKD46 ( 9 ) ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Our recipient strain for the PCR-mutagenized sequences was TH6303 ( pKD46 / hin-5717 : : FRT ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ) , selecting for Tcs recombinants that replaced the ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ( P : : tetRA-12 ) allele . 
Tcs ﬂiC recombinants were then screened for a nonmotile phenotype ( Fig. 2B ) . 
The hin-5717 : : FRT allele of TH6303 prevents ﬂagellar phase variation and locks this strain into the ﬂiCON orientation ( 8 ) . 
As a result , any nonmotile Tcs recombinants isolated must alter ﬂiC expression or secretion . 
Mutagenesis performed throughout the present study allowed for the isolation of approximately 200 nonmotile mutants that were analyzed for ﬂiC transcription , translation , and secretion . 
To classify the nonmotile mutants in the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene according to those affecting transcription , translation , or motility , insertions of the MudJ and MudK transcriptional and translational reporters , respectively , were recombined into the ﬂiC gene ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Transcription and translation of ﬂiC was determined by measuring the - galactosidase activities of the resulting strains . 
Examples of mutants defective in translation are shown in Fig. 6 . 
These mutants exhibit wild-type expression of a lac transcriptional reporter ( ﬂiC-lac ) but are defective in expression of a ﬂiC-lacZ translational reporter ( FliC-LacZ ) . 
In addition , the nonmotile phenotype of the original mutants was conﬁrmed after two passages on nonselective agar plates in comparison to the wild-type strain LT2 on soft agar motility plates ( data not shown ) . 
Figure 7 summarizes the results of the mutagenesis performed , highlighting 44 of the mutants obtained . 
Mutants classiﬁed as motility speciﬁc were those showing levels of - galactosidase comparable to the wild-type sequence upstream of the ﬂiC : : MudJ and ﬂiC : : MudK lac transcriptional and translational reporters but reduced motility on soft agar motility medium . 
Mutants classiﬁed as translation speciﬁc were those showing both reduced motility and reduced levels of - galactosidase when combined with the ﬂiC : : MudK lac translational reporter but wild-type levels of - galactosi-dase when combined with the ﬂiC : : MudJ lac transcriptional reporter . 
Mutants classiﬁed as transcription speciﬁc showed reduced motility and reduced - galactosidase when combined with either the ﬂiC : : MudJ or the ﬂiC : : MudK reporter . 
The majority of the 200 nonmotile mutants were analyzed further by DNA sequence analysis of the ﬂiC 5 UTR region and ﬂanking sequences subject to mutagenesis . 
Those that had more than one base substitution were not analyzed further . 
Ten mutants resulting from single base substitutions were classiﬁed as motility speciﬁc . 
All 10 were located in the ﬂiC-coding region ( Fig. 7A ) . 
All but one of the transcription-speciﬁc mutants was in the ﬂiC promoter , including base substitutions in the 10 and 35 sequences and a single base deletion in the spacer region ( Fig. 7B ) . 
The unlinked transcription-speciﬁc mutant resulted in a C : U transition mutation changing ﬂiC codon 3 to a ochre stop codon . 
The effect of this mutation on the expression of the ﬂiC : : MudJ transcriptional fusion is most likely due to transcriptional polarity . 
The translation-speciﬁc mutants included expected single base substitutions in the AUG start codon and consensus ribosomal binding site region ( Fig. 6 , 9G : A , 9G : C and 10G : C ) . 
However , other trans-lation-speciﬁc mutations appeared in a predicted stem-loop structure ( Fig. 7C ) . 
These were single base substitutions that inhibited ﬂiC mRNA translation ( Fig. 7C and Fig. 6 , bases 36 to 45 ) . 
The single mutants 45G : C and 38C : G in the predicted stem-loop possess a motility defect and are defective in ﬂiC-lacZ translation ( Fig. 8 and 9 ) . 
The mutations 45G : C and 38C : G are predicted to interact with each other in the formation of an RNA stem structure . 
To conﬁrm this prediction , the double mutant 45G : C 38C : G was constructed by PCR and introduced into TH6303 by - Red recombination . 
Analysis of the ﬂiC expression proﬁle of Tcs recombinants showed that the 45G : C 38C : G double mutant recovered motility and 80 % of the wild-type ﬂiC expression ( Fig. 8 and 9 ) . 
This suggests that the stem-loop structure and possibly the entire predicted structure is genuine and that mutations altering the predicted 5 UTR secondary structure prevent efﬁcient ﬂiC expression .

DISCUSSION
The original goal of this study was to isolate mutants in the ﬂiC 5 UTR important for ﬂiC gene expression , which were transcribed and translated normally and speciﬁc to ﬁlament assembly . 
Using a set of tetA-ﬂiC operon constructs with different amounts of the 5 UTR ﬂiC region between the tetA stop codon and the ﬂiC start codon , we found that the entire 5 UTR region is needed for a motile phenotype under inducing conditions . 
These results suggested a requirement for the ﬂiC 5 UTR in ﬁlament assembly when ﬂiC is expressed from the chromosome . 
However , numerous labs , including ours , hav expressed the ﬂiC gene from multicopy plasmids without the ﬂiC 5 UTR sequence , and these plasmids complement a ﬂiCnull allele for motility ( 21 , 22 ) . 
This suggests that any requirement of sequences in the ﬂiC 5 UTR for FliC assembly independent of transcription would likely be involved in efﬁciency of assembly and not absolutely required . 
Such a phenotype has been observed before in Salmonella ﬂagellar assembly . 
When the FlgN secretion chaperone of the hook-ﬁlament junction proteins ( FlgK and FlgL ) is absent , FlgK was found to become unstable and resulted in a defect in motility . 
Motility in an ﬂgN-null mutant was restored when the ﬂgKL operon was expressed from a high-copy-number plasmid , suggesting tha

The effect of the D43G , A64T , and N83S mutants on motility in a strain expressing ﬂjB and deleted for ﬂjA is also shown . 
❋ , Not determined . 
( B ) Single DNA base substitutions in the ﬂiC promoter region that were defective in ﬂiC-lac transcription . 
( C ) Single DNA base substitutions in the ﬂiC 5 UTR region that were defective in transcription ( red ) and translation ( green ) . 
FlgN contributed to the efﬁciency of assembly and was not essential ( 3 ) . 
Because the ﬂagellum is a complex structure and we believe that efﬁciency of assembly has been under strong evolutionary pressure , we expect to ﬁnd many stages in ﬂagellar assembly where the temporal efﬁciency of assembly , rather than energy efﬁciency , has been maximized ( the ﬁrst to assemble ﬂagella and get to the food source wins the evolution race ) . 
The exhaustive search for single base changes in the 5 UTR that affected assembly independent of transcription and translation suggests , in light of the results with the tetA-ﬂiC operon constructions , that multiple changes are going to be required to see an effect . 
Finally , we want to stress that the signiﬁcant ﬁndings reported here were a result of targeted mutagenesis to the chromosomal ﬂiC region . 
The use of multicopy plasmids introduces the artifact of excess gene dosage , which in the case of the ﬂiC structural gene masks the effects of the 5 UTR on assembly . 
In the type III secretion ﬁeld , there are three types of reported secretion signals : N-terminal amino acid structural , 5 UTR , and type III chaperone assisted ( 4 ) . 
How these individual or a combination of signals are utilized for a given secretion substrate could inﬂuence the timing and amount of secretion and therefore the efﬁciency of ﬂagellum assembly or pathogenesis . 
For FliC , overexpression from a multicopy vector would presumably allow secretion to be directed by amino acid and chaperone binding signals only . 
The simple technology of the bacteriophage recombination system to efﬁciently direct mutagenesis to a speciﬁc region of the chromosome such as the ﬂiC 5 UTR is a powerful tool not only for the selection and screening of speciﬁc mutants from the natural chromosomal location but also for mutational changes resulting in no phenotypic differences from the wild type ( 16 ) . 
This allows for a thorough analysis of any speciﬁc segment of a gene to be analyzed . 
The present study took advantage of the tetracycline resistance genes from transposon Tn10 , which allowed for replacement of the region to be targeted by the tetRA sequences followed by replacement of the tetRA sequences by the mutagenized segment . 
Any construct that can be selected for and against can be used for such studies . 
For example , a sacB-npt cassette can be inserted selecting for npt-encoded neomycin resistance and selected against because sacB-expressing cells die on media containing sucrose . 
Such tools will allow genet-icists to focus on the isolation and characterization of mutants in the single-copy setting of the chromosome and avoid the complications of plasmid artifacts . 
FIG. 8 . 
ﬂiC expression proﬁles using ﬂiC-lac and ﬂiC-lacZ fusions of mutations in a predicted stem structure in the 5 UTR . 
The transcriptional and translational activities of 45G : C , 38C : G , and the double mutant 45G : C 38 C : G are compared to the wild type . 
Both single mutants that disrupt the predicted stem-loop show reduced translation but comparable transcriptional levels . 
In contrast , the double mutant retains a ﬂiC expression proﬁle similar to the wild type even though both transcription and translation are reduced twofold . 
Upon comparison with Fig. 9 , the level of translation in 45G : C 38C : G is sufﬁcient to obtain a motile phenotype .
