Abstract 
The function of a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) is essential for the intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Expression of SPI2 genes is induced within the Salmonella-containing vacuole ( SCV ) inside host cells and is controlled by the SsrAB two-component system . 
However , the nature of the signals leading to expression of SPI2 genes is controversial . 
Here we report that expression of SPI2 genes can be induced independently by two different environmental stimuli . 
Exposure of bacteria to slightly acidic pH was sufﬁcient to induce a rapid up-regulation of SPI2 genes . 
In contrast , limitation of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) in the growth media led to activation of SPI2 genes in the late exponential growth phase and was independent of the media pH. Limitation of Pi induced an over-expression of sensor protein SsrB . 
Response to both environmental stimuli required a functional SsrAB system . 
In vivo analyses indicated that limitation of Pi is also encountered by intracellular Salmonella . 
Our observations allow the integration of previous disparate reports on the induction of SPI2 genes .

Introduction
The temporal and spatial regulation of expression of virulence factors is essential for successful pathogenesis by the gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica . 
This pathogen is taken up by ingestion of contaminated food or drinking water . 
Depending on the infecting serotype , S. enterica can cause a localized , usually selflimiting gastroenteritis , or a systemic , life-threatening infection known as typhoid fever . 
In susceptible mouse strains , infection with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) results in a systemic infection resembling human typhoid . 
In the course of infection , Salmonella are confronted with changing environments in various anatomical sites of their hosts . 
The environmental stimuli include exposure to low pH in the stomach , digestive enzymes , antimicrobial peptides and an established microbial community in the intestinal lumen and after invasion of , or phagocytosis by host cells , the presence in a vacuole . 
A variety of sensor systems allows the pathogen to respond to the changing environmental conditions during infection and to activate the appropriate sets of metabolic and virulenc genes ( reviewed in ( Foster and Spector , 1995 ; Slauch et al. , 1997 ) ) . 
Important virulence factors of Salmonella are encoded by genes on chromosomal regions termed Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPI ) . 
Among these , SPI2 is essential for systemic virulence of Salmonella . 
SPI2 encodes a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) , a complex molecular machine that mediates the translocation of a large number of effector proteins into the eukaryotic target cell ( Kuhle et al. , 2004 ) . 
The translocated effector proteins modify normal host cell functions and permit intracellular proliferation of Salmonella . 
The regulatory cascade controlling the expression of SPI2 genes is only partially understood . 
SPI2 encodes the two-component system SsrAB , and various studies demonstrated that the function of SsrAB is crucial for the expression of virulence genes within SPI2 and various loci outside of SPI2 encoding effector proteins of the SPI2-T3SS ( Deiwick and Hensel , 1999 ; HansenWester et al. , 2002 ; Worley et al. , 2000 ) . 
The expression of ssrAB is affected by global regulatory systems such as PhoPQ ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ; Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ) , OmpR/EnzV ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Feng et al. , 2003 ; Kim and Falkow , 2004 ) and SlyA ( Navarre et al. , 2005 ; Linehan et al. , 2005 ) . 
It has been shown before that SPI2 genes are activated by intracellular S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Valdivia and Falkow , 1997 ; Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) . 
The speciﬁc signal that is received by sensor SsrA leading to activation of response regulator SsrB and expression of SPI2 genes is not known to date . 
Controversial observations have been made on the role of environmental signals required for induction of SPI2 genes , but indirect evidence suggests that nutritional limitations activate expression of SPI2 genes . 
We have previously deﬁned in vitro conditions that induced SPI2 gene expression ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) indicating that limitations of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) or magnesium induce expression , while other starvation conditions had no effect on SPI2 gene expression . 
Furthermore , acidic pH , another condition encountered within the Salmo-nella-containing vacuole ( SCV ) of infected host cells , has been shown to affect the assembly of the SPI2-encoded T3SS ( Rappl et al. , 2003 ) and to trigger secretion of substrate proteins by this apparatus ( Beuzon et al. , 1999 ; Hansen-Wester et al. , 2002 ) . 
Other reports indicated that exposure to acidic pH of 4.5 leads to activation of SPI2 gene expression ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Garmendia et al. , 2003 ) . 
By analyzing expression of GFP reporter fusions after overnight growth , Garmendia et al. ( 2003 ) reported that SPI2 expression is activated by low concentrations of Ca or low osmolarity of the media . 
2 + Miao et al. ( 2002 ) analyzed the expression of luciferase reporter fusions to SPI2 effector gene sspH2 and reported that low pH or limitation of Mg or Pi are 2 + not required for induction of this SsrAB-regulated gene .

As the understanding of signals that induce expression of virulence factors of this pathogen is instrumental for understanding the pathogenesis of systemic salmo-nellosis , we set out to characterize these stimuli . 
An experimental limitation of several previous studies was the use of poorly deﬁned or insufﬁciently buffered synthetic media that made the dissection of environmental stimuli problematic . 
Furthermore , interpretation of previous results may be complicated by the fact that only a single gene of the SPI2 regulon was analyzed or that the media pH during growth was not monitored . 
In this study , a detailed analysis of effects of environmental conditions on expression of various SPI2 genes was performed . 
Our results show that slightly acidic pH of growth media or limitation of Pi act as independent environmental signals that activate SPI2 expression with different kinetics . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhi-murium ) strain NCTC 12023 was used as wild-type strain throughout this study and all mutant strains were isogenic derivatives of 12023 . 
Strains used in this study are described in Table 1 . 
For the generation of an epitope-tagged derivative of sseJ on the Salmonella chromosome , a modiﬁcation of the one-step mutagenesis approach was applied ( Uzzau et al. , 2001 ) . 
Brieﬂy , primers SseJ-HA-For and SseJ-HA-Rev ( Table 2 ) were used to amplify the tagging cassette of pSUB314 and the resulting product was used to transform S. Typhimurium [ pKD46 ] to kanamycin resistance . 
The aph gene of the integrated cassette was deleted by FLP-mediated recombination as described before ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) to generate strain MvP398 . 
Strains deﬁcient in ssrA ( MvP536 ) or ssrB ( MvP532 ) were constructed using the one-step deletion approach using primer sets SsrA-Del-For/SsrA-Del-Rev and SsrB-Del-For/SsrB-Del-Rev ( Table 2 ) as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) and the aph resistance cassette was removed . 
For generation of plasmid p2963 , the rrnB transcriptional terminators were ampliﬁed from pBAD-mycB using primers TTrrnB-HindIII-For and TTrrnB-EcoRV-Rev and the resulting fragment was cloned into HindIII/EcoRV-digested low-copy-number vector pWSK29 . 
A fusion between PpstS and GFP was generated by ` splicing by overlap extension ' PCR according to standard methods ( McPherson and Moller , 2000 ) . 
Basically , PpstS was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium using primers Pro-PstS-For-EcoR and PstS-GFP-SOE-P2B , and GFP was ampliﬁed from plasmid pFPV25 .1 using primers GFP-SOE-P3B and GFP-SOE-P4 . 
The resulting fragments were puriﬁed , mixed and used as template DNA for a second PCR with primers Pro-PstS-EcoRI and GFP-SOE-P4 . 
The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in p2963 to generate p2964 . 
For the generation of a plasmid for the expression of HA-epitope-tagged effector SspH2 , the promoter and coding region of sspH2 was ampliﬁed using primers SspH2-Pro-For-HindIII and SspH2-HA-Rev-XbaI ( Table 2 ) , the resulting product was digested and cloned in HindIII/XbaI-digested plasmid pWSK29 to generate p2800

Routine culture of S. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains was performed in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth or on LB agar containing antibiotics if required for the selection of plasmids . 
The antibiotics carbenicillin or kanamycin were used at 50 mg/ml . 
Synthetic media affecting SPI2 gene expression and SPI2-T3SS secretion have been described before ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) . 
In addition , PCN media with various concentrations of Pi were used , for example PCN containing 1 mM Pi was designated PCN ( 1.0 ) . 
The composition of PCN was as follows : 80 mM MOPS or 80 mM MES ; 4 mM Tricine ; 100 mM FeCl3 ; 376 mM K2SO4 ; 50 mM NaCl ; x ( as speciﬁed in the Results section ) mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 , 0.4 % glucose , 15 mM NH4Cl ; 1 mM MgSO4 , 10 mM CaCl2 ; micronutrients ( 10 nM Na2MoO4 ; 10 nM NaSeO3 ; 4 nM H3BO3 ; 300 nM CoCl2 ; 100 nM CuSO4 ; 800 nM MnCl2 ; 1 nM ZnSO4 ) . 
PCN media were used at various pH with MOPS for buffering between pH 6.6 and 8.0 , and MES for buffering between pH 4.8 and 6.4 . 
The pH of the cultures was routinely monitored indicating that the buffering capacity of the media was sufﬁcient to prevent a drop in pH of more than 0.4 pH units . 
Overnight cultures used as inoculum were diluted 1:50 in fresh media . 
Generation of antisera
For the generation of a polyclonal antiserum against SsrA , the peptide GEKHRLFLQSSDC representing residues 114 -- 126 in the periplasmic loop of SsrA was synthesized . 
The peptide was covalently linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier protein . 
A rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with 200 mg of the antigen in complete Freund 's adjuvant according to standard methods ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) in accordance with national and institutional guidelines for animal handling . 
Booster immunizations were performed with 50 mg antigen in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant on day 21 and without adjuvant on day 56 after primary immunization . 
Antiserum was collected 70 days after primary immunization . 
Culture conditions 
Gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses
For the analyses of synthesis of proteins of the SsrAB regulon , bacterial strains were cultured under various conditions as indicated . 
At various times , aliquots of the cultures were taken and the OD600 was recorded . 
Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min . 
Lysates of bacterial cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8 % , 12 % or 10 % gels for the detection of SsrA , SseB or other effector proteins , respectively . 
The volumes of the lysates were adjusted by the OD600 reads of the cultures in order to subject comparable amounts of cells to the analyses . 
This procedure resulted in comparable protein loading for the wild-type strain grown under various conditions as determined by control Western blot analyses with an antibody against constitutively synthesized DnaK . 
In case strains with defects in different regulatory systems were compared , the protein concentration of bacterial suspensions was determined using a BCA kit ( Pierce ) , and samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE . 
Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Schleicher and Schuell ) and detection of various proteins was performed with the indicated primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies using chemiluminescence detection ( GE Amersham ) . 
Antisera and antibodies are described in Table 3 . 
Infection of macrophages
The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FCS in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 1C . 
Infection of macro-phages has been described ( Deiwick and Hensel , 1999 ) . 
For the inhibition of vacuolar acidiﬁcation , the V-ATPase inhibitor baﬁlomycin A1 ( Sigma ) was dissolved in DMSO and used as speciﬁed in the Results section .

Nutritional limitation of inorganic phosphate or acidic media pH independently induce the SPI2 regulon
In order to delineate the environmental stimuli leading to activation of the SsrAB regulon , we analyzed expression of SPI2 genes and synthesis of SPI2 proteins during growth in fully deﬁned synthetic media . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) was grown in minimal media with various amounts of inorganic phosphate ( 0.12 , 0.4 , 1.0 or 25 mM ) adjusted to pH 7.4 . 
At various times of culture growth , bacterial cells were lysed and the amounts of SseB and SseJ were detected by Western blot analyses . 
SseJ is a translocated effector protein and SseB is a secreted protein required for the translocation of effector proteins . 
Growth in media with neutral pH and concentrations lower than 1 mM of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) resulted in synthesis of SPI2 proteins ( Fig. 1 ) , while only low mounts of SseB and SseJ were detected after growth in minima media containing 1.0 mM Pi and no synthesis was detectable in media with 25 mM Pi . 
The pH of the media was monitored at various times of culture and did not drop below 6.9 ( data not shown ) . 
To analyze the effect of acidic pH on the synthesis of SseB and SseJ , cultures were grown in minimal media adjusted to pH 5.8 with 0.4 or 25 mM Pi . 
Under these conditions , rapid increase in levels of SseB and SseJ in media with 0.4 mM as well as 25 mM Pi was observed ( Fig. 1 ) . 
After 8 h of culture , the levels of cell-associated SseJ decreased , while level of SseB did not change . 
These observations indicate that limitation of Pi at neutral pH induced synthesis of proteins of the SPI2 regulon and that growth at acidic pH induces synthesis of these proteins independent of phosphate starvation .

The cells were harvested , washed in PCN 0.4 mM Pi , pH 7.4 and used to inoculate PCN media at pH 7.4 or 5.8 containing various concentrations of Pi as indicated . 
Growth at 371C was continued with vigorous aeration . 
At the indicated times , aliquots of the culture were taken and the optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) was determined ( A ) and lysates of bacterial cells were subjected to Western blot analyses for the detection of SseB and SseJ ( B ) .

S. Typhimurium wild type was grown overnight in PCN containing 1.0 mM Pi at pH 7.4 . 
PCN containing 1.0 mM Pi adjusted to various pH as indicated were inoculated and cultures were grown at 371C with aeration . 
At various times after inoculation , aliquots of the cultures were collected and processed for Western blot analyses of SseB . 
Slight acidiﬁcation is sufﬁcient to induce synthesis of SseB 
The effect of acidic pH on synthesis of proteins of the SPI2 regulon prompted us to investigate the pH dependency in more detail . 
Bacteria were pre-cultured in PCN ( 1.0 ) , pH 7.4 , and then used to inoculate PCN media adjusted to various pH ranging from 4.6 to 8.2 . 
At various times after inoculation , samples were taken and the amounts of SseB as a representative part of the SPI2 regulon were analyzed ( Fig. 2 ) . 
We observed a rapid increase in levels of SseB when bacterial cultures were shifted to media with pH between 4.6 and 6.2 . 
Only low amounts of SseB were present in bacteria grown at pH 6.6 and levels of SseB remained very low in cells grown at higher pH. The pH of the cultures at the time of sampling was measured and indicated a decrease of the pH of up to 0.4 units below the initial pH.

S. Typhimurium wild type , strain MvP398 for expression of chromosomally HA-tagged SseJ and various strains harboring plasmids for the expression of epitope-tagged variants of the effector proteins SifB , SseF or SspH2 were pre-cultured in PCN containing 1.0 mM Pi at pH 7.4 . 
Aliquots of overnight cultures were used to inoculate PCN 1.0 mM Pi , pH 5.8 . 
At various times after inoculation , aliquots of the cultures were collected and subjected to Western blot analyses . 
SseB and SseC were detected with speciﬁc antisera , SifB with a monoclonal antibody against the M45 epitope and SseJ , SseF and SspH2 with a monoclonal antibody against the HA tag . 
Due to the appearance of a cross reaction for the M45 antibody , the position of SifB is indicated by an arrow . 
pH-dependent synthesis of SPI2-T3SS substrate proteins 
The effect of acidic growth media on other secreted SPI2 proteins was analyzed . 
In addition to SseJ , synthesis of further effector proteins , SifB , SseF and SspH2 , was monitored using strains expressing epitope-tagged derivatives of these effectors , while speciﬁc antisera were used for detection of translocon proteins SseB and SseC ( Fig. 3 ) . 
We observed that these members of the SPI2 regulon were synthesized in response to acidic pH. Increased levels of effector proteins were detected shortly after shift to acidic pH during the exponential growth phase of the culture . 
A decrease in the levels of effector proteins was observed after 8 h of culture . 
In contrast , the amounts of translocon proteins SseB and SseC were not decreased at 8 h of culture . 
Although sseB , sseC and sseF are all expressed under control of promoter PsseA , different amounts of cell-associated protein were detected at various times during culture . 
This observation is in line with the secretion of effector proteins ( e.g. SseF , SseJ ) into the culture medi 
pH-dependent synthesis of SPI2-T3SS substrate proteins 
( data not shown ) and the observation that translocon proteins SseB and SseC remain associated with the cell envelope after secretion ( Nikolaus et al. , 2001 ; Chakravortty et al. , 2005 ) . 
Differential regulation of SPI2 promoters by environmental conditions
The effect of acidic pH or limitation of Pi on promoters of various transcriptional units in SPI2 was analyzed using transcriptional fusions to luc as a reporter gene ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The expression of transcriptional units for structural T3SS components under control of PssaB , PsseA and PssaG was rapidly induced

by shift to PCN ( 1.0 ) , pH 5.8 . 
A decrease in reporter activity was observed after 8 h of culture . 
In contrast , no induction of these reporter fusions was observed prior to 4 h of growth in PCN ( 0.4 ) , pH 7.4 . 
During growth in media with limiting amounts of inorganic phosphate , expression started in the late log phase of cultural growth , i.e. after 5 -- 6 h of culture . 
No induction of the PssaB reporter fusion was observed in an ssrB-deﬁcient strain ( Fig. 4 ) and similar observations were made for other reporter fusions in this mutant background ( data not shown ) . 
Although luc activities for the PssrA reporter strain were much lower , the response of this promoter to acidic pH or Pi limitation was similar to the other promoters .

Limitation of inorganic phosphate and global regulatory systems affects levels of sensor protein SsrA
We next analyzed the effect of the different inducing stimuli on the cellular levels of SsrA , the sensor of the SsrAB two-component regulatory system ( Fig. 5 ) . 
An antiserum was raised against a peptide derived from the periplasmic loop of SsrA , and the antiserum recognized SsrA in cell lysates of wild-type S. Typhimurium . 
Western blot analysis revealed a strong increase in the levels of SsrA when cells were grown under conditions of phosphate starvation ( 0.12 or 0.4 mM Pi ) . 
Only slight increases in SsrA levels were observed during growth in PCN ( 1.0 ) , pH 7.4 or PCN ( 0.4 ) , pH 5.8 . 
In general , the onset of the increase in SsrA levels was around 7 h after start of the culture and coincided with entering the stationary growth phase ( data not shown ) . 
No increase in SsrA levels was detected during growth in PCN ( 25 ) , pH 7.4 or 5.8 . 
We conclude that growth with limitation of Pi , but not acidic pH , results in increased synthesis of SsrA . 
This effect is likely to be post-transcriptional since the PssrA reporter studies ( Fig. 4 ) indicated similar levels of induction by both stimuli . 
Additionally , the effect of global regulatory systems on the expression of SsrA was analyzed ( Fig. 6 ) . 
S. Typhimurium wild-type and mutant strains deﬁcient in SsrB or in components of the PhoPQ or OmpR/EnvZ regulatory systems were cultured at neutral pH with limiting or non-limiting Pi concentrations . 
Western blot analyses shown in Fig. 5 indicated increased amounts of SsrA after growth under Pi limitation . 
A similar effect was observed for phoP - and envZ-deﬁcient strains although the levels of SsrA were lower ( Fig. 6 ) . 
In the background of the pho-24 allele , resulting in constitutive expression of PhoPQ-activated genes , high levels of SsrA were observed after growth in media with high as well as with low Pi concentrations .

amounts of SsrA were observed in the background of strain P8G12 harboring a transposon insertion in ssrB . 
SsrA was not detectable in the ompR-deﬁcient strain . 
We also observed reduced expression of luc fusions to various SPI2 promoters ( data not shown ) indicating that OmpR but not EnvZ is essential for SPI2 activation in our experimental setting . 
The effects of the various regulatory systems on cellular levels of SseB were comparable to those on SsrA , indicating that a gene under control of the SsrAB system responds in a similar fashion . 
Synthesis of SPI2-encoded proteins in response to acidic pH or phosphate limitation depends on SsrA and SsrB function 
Although the SsrAB two-component system has been identiﬁed as the central regulatory system of SPI2 regulation , it is conceivable that this system is bypassed by direct effects of other regulators on SPI2 promoters . 
Previous studies were performed with mutant strains harboring transposon insertions in ssrA or ssrB that may be prone to artifacts generated by polar effects of the transposon . 
To investigate the contribution of ssrA and ssrB to the induction by different stimuli , genespeciﬁc deletions were constructed . 
The levels of SseB were analyzed in S. Typhimurium wild type and the ssrA and ssrB strains after growth under induction by starvation for Pi ( Fig. 7A ) or acidic pH ( Fig. 7B ) . 
No synthesis of SseB was detected in ssrA - or ssrB-deﬁcient strains under either growth condition . 
This observation indicates that the rapid induction by acidic pH and the delayed induction by starvation for Pi are both integrated by a functional SsrAB system . 
Thus , it is unlikely that either stimulus is sensed and mediated b other regulatory systems or that other regulatory system mediate induction by interacting with only one component of the SsrAB system . 
SPI2 promoter activity in intracellular bacteria
We analyzed the activity of PsseA as a representative SPI2 promoter in S. Typhimurium after uptake by macrophages . 
Experiments were performed in the presence or absence of baﬁlomycin A1 , an inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase that mediates the acidiﬁcation of the phagosomal lumen . 
We have previously determined that concentrations of baﬁlomycin A1 as low as 10 nM were sufﬁcient to inhibit phagosome acidiﬁcation and to reduce the intracellular replication of Salmonella ( Chakravortty et al. , 2005 ) . 
Baﬁlomycin A1 at ﬁnal concentrations of 10 or 50 nM was either added 30 min prior to infection or simultaneously with the bacterial inoculum . 
Alternatively , to avoid baﬁlomycin-induced alterations of phagocytosis and initial processing of the internalized bacteria , the inhibitor was added after the 30-min infection step and removal of non-internalized bacteria . 
The activity of PsseA was analyzed 2 h after infection by monitoring the intensity of GFP ﬂuorescence ( Fig. 8A ) . 
Under either condition , expression of the PsseA : : GFP fusion was not abolished by addition of baﬁlomycin . 
The GFP ﬂuorescence of about 20 intracellular bacteria was individually determined by image analysis . 
When baﬁlomycin was added prior to infection , the mean ﬂuorescence was not altered . 
When baﬁlomycin was added after infection and maintained throughout the incubation , a small reduction of mean ﬂuorescence intensities was observed that was not signiﬁcant ( Fig. 8B ) . 
These data are in line with our previous ﬁndings that baﬁlomycin inhibits intracellular replication and assembly of a functional SPI2-T3SS , but had no inﬂuence on expression of the genes under control of PsseA ( Chakravortty et al. , 2005 ) .

Cultures were grown for 16 h. ( B ) Overnight cultures were used to inoculate PCN 1.0 mM Pi , pH 5.8 media and samples were taken after 2 and 4 h of culture growth . 
Aliquots of the cultures were adjusted to equal amounts of cells based on OD600 and cells were lysed by boiling in SDS-sample buffer . 
Levels of SseB in lysates were determined by Western blot analyses . 
Inorganic phosphate availability affects gene expression of intracellular Salmonella
To further evaluate the role of different environmental stimuli on expression of SPI2 genes by intracellular Salmonella , we attempted to modify the intraphagosomal Pi . 
To control the experimental setup , a GFP reporter fusion with PpstS was generated . 
pstS encodes a part of the high-afﬁnity Pi uptake system Pst and is highly induced by Salmonella within the SCV ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) . 
Comparison of cultures grown in vitro in PCN ( 0.4 ) , pH 7.4 , and PCN ( 25 ) , pH 7.4 , showed that PpstS : : GFP and PsseA : : GFP fusions were induced 88 - and 30.5-fold , respectively , in media with low Pi concentrations ( Fig. 9 ) . 
Following the experimental approach taken by Blanc-Potard and Groisman ( 1997 ) to study the role of Mg on intracellular 2 + Salmonella , here high concentrations of Pi were added to the growth media of Salmonella-infected macro-phages and intracellular gene expression of reporter strains was monitored . 
We found that addition of 50 mM Pi to standard DMEM had only minor effects on host cell viability and did not result in precipitation of media compounds ( data not shown ) . 
Macrophages were infected with Salmonella wild-type harboring plasmids for the constitutive expression of GFP , or GFP reporter fusions to PsseA or PpstS . 
After infection , macrophages were cultured for 16 h with or without addition of 50 mM Pi , lysed to release bacteria and GFP ﬂuorescence of individual bacteria was monitored by ﬂow cytometry . 
By addition of 50 mM Pi to the external media , the expression of the PpstS : : GFP reporter was 4-fold reduced . 
A constitutively expressed GFP reporter was only slightly reduced by Pi addition . 
These controls indicated that addition of phosphate to the external environment affects , to a limited extent , the phosphate concentration within the phagosome . 
We also observed a 2-fold reduction of the expression of the PsseA : : GFP reporter in the presence of high amounts of external inorganic phosphate . 
These observations suggest that the availability of the inorganic phosphate within the SCV is a signal that affects SPI2 expression .

Rapid induction of SPI2 gene expression by intracellular Salmonella is not affected by an inhibitor of phagosomal acidiﬁcation . 
The macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 was grown on coverslips and infected with wild-type S. Typhimurium harboring pLS824 ( PsseA : : GFP ) . 
Baﬁlomycin A1 to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM ( 50 nM BAF ) or an equal amount of the solvent DMSO ( 0 nM BAF ) was added 30 min prior to infection . 
After infection for 30 min , non-internalized bacteria and the inhibitor were removed by washing trice with PBS , and medium containing gentamicin was added . 
Alternatively , cells were infected for 30 min , washing was performed to remove non-internalized bacteria , and medium containing gentamicin and baﬁlomycin A1 was added post-infection and maintained for the rest of the incubation .

Discussion
In our study , we delineated the environmental signals that result in expression of various transcriptional units of SPI2 genes . 
We observed that two independent mechanisms exist that lead to induction of SPI2 expression . 
( i ) Growth in minimal media with limiting amounts of inorganic phosphate resulted in up-regula-tion of SPI2 gene expression that coincided with entry into the stationary growth phase . 
( ii ) Exposure of bacteria to minimal media with acidic pH of 6.2 or below resulted in a rapid induction of SPI2 expression that initiated in the exponential growth phase . 
This pH-dependent effect was independent from the amount of available inorganic phosphate or other nutrients . 
Vice versa , induction by starvation for inorganic phosphate was independent on the pH of the growth media . 
Both representative of two independent experiments with similar outcome . 
modes of activation required the function of SsrA and SsrB , indicating that neither of the stimuli was directly transmitted by circumvention of the SsrAB system . 
The effects of the environmental stimuli are summarized in Table 4 
The data reported here allow to resolve disparate previous observations . 
In synthetic media , a slight decrease in pH was sufﬁcient to induce SPI2 gene expression , and we observed that many commonly used minimal media are insufﬁciently buffered to maintain a neutral pH during culture ( data not shown ) . 
The luciferase reporter data indicate that induction by low pH is limited to a certain period during growth and expression returns to basal levels after 14 h of culture ( Fig. 4 ) . 
This observation indicates that expression data from overnight cultures may lead to erroneous interpretations , and stress the importance of analysis following the growth kinetics of the bacteria . 
The role of environmental signals in the regulation of SPI2 gene expression is controversial . 
The data reported here show that previous observations by other groups on the role of acidic pH for SPI2 induction ( Kim and Falkow , 2004 ; Lee et al. , 2000 ) as well as our previous observation on the role of Pi concentration ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) are valid . 
Acidic pH also induces the secretion of effector proteins as well as SseB , C and D that are involved in the translocation process . 
Recent work of Coombes et al. ( 2004 ) demonstra-ted that exposure to acidic pH does not result in increased levels of SseB and SseD in absence of a functional SPI2-T3SS . 
At least for the transcriptional unit under control of PsseA , control by acidic pH and a functional SPI2-T3SS was postulated . 
Our group recently demonstrated that acidic media pH is required for the functional assembly of the SPI2-T3SS , thus enabling the secretion by this system ( Rappl et al. , 2003 ) . 
Taken together , these data support a mechanism in which the induction of SPI2 genes is linked to active secretion by the T3SS . 
Our observation is in line with the study of Miao et al. ( 2002 ) that suggested an inhibition by alkaline pH. These authors observed an induction of a reporter gene fusion with the SPI2 effector gene sspH2 in minimal media of neutral or acidic pH. However , closer examination of the experimental data of Miao et al. shows that under the experimental conditions applied , a slight drop of the media pH occurred that would be sufﬁcient for pH-dependent induction . 
This observation indicates that monitoring of media pH will be important for further studies on SPI2 regulation . 
We observed that growth under conditions of phosphate limitation resulted in increased cellular levels of SsrA ( Fig. 5 ) . 
However , the expression of SPI2 genes was not dependent on the presence of high amounts of SsrA , since growth in media with low pH and nonlimiting concentrations of Pi induced expression of SPI2 genes but not the synthesis of increased amount of SsrA . 
However , high amounts of the sensor SsrA could lead to increased phosphorylation of the response regulator SsrB , even in the absence of the correct physiological signal . 
In such scenario , pH would represent the relevant signal for the SsrAB system while limitation of Pi leads to an indirect induction of SPI2 expression . 
Role of environmental stimuli in vivo
Which of the two independent environmental stimuli is relevant for SPI2 during the intracellular phase of Salmonella pathogenesis ? 
It is well established that host cell phagosomes acidify after uptake of micro-organisms by phagocytosis . 
An acidiﬁcation of the SCV was observed and previous work indicated that the acidiﬁcation is required for intracellular replication of Salmonella ( Rathman et al. , 1996 ) . 
However , we found that inhibiting phagosomal acidiﬁcation by inhibiting the V-ATPase prevents secretion and translocation by the SPI2-T3SS but did not signiﬁcantly affect expression ( Chakravortty et al. , 2005 ; this study ) . 
Given the threshold of pH 6.2 for the pH-dependent induction determined in vitro , it is conceivable that the slightly acidic pH of about 6.0 in early endosomes is sufﬁcient to trigger expression of SPI2 genes . 
This would also imply that acidiﬁcation to pH below 6.0 during phagosome maturation is not essential for SPI2 induction . 
These observations suggest that a slight acidiﬁcation of the phagosome can occur by V-ATPase-independent mechanisms , or that a combination of partially redundant environmental signals affects SPI2 induction . 
In conclusion , we demonstrated that slight acidiﬁcation or limitation of Pi form independent signals for the induction of SPI2 gene expression in vitro . 
Both environmental stimuli are also present within Salmonel-la-infected host cells . 
Sensing of several distinc environmental stimuli has been reported for other sensory systems as well as the integration of signals from other two-component systems ( reviewed in Bijlsma and Groisman , 2003 ) . 
Whether either of these effects applies to SsrA needs to be determined by further studies . 
Recent studies on molecular signals sensed by the PhoPQ system of Salmonella impressively showed that this well characterized two-component system senses antimicrobial peptides rather than low concentrations of Mg ( Bader et al. , 2005 ; Martin-Orozco 2 + et al. , 2006 ) . 
At present , the chemical or physical nature of the signal sensed by SsrA is not known and we can not rule out that other regulatory systems receive signals that are transduced via SsrAB . 
SsrA is a sensory protein that is unusual due to the presence of a high number of functional domains in the cytoplasmic moiety and in the presence of a large periplasmic moiety . 
Further work has to reveal the nature of signals received by SsrA .
