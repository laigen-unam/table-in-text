For centuries , indigenous plants have been used against enteritis but their molecular targets and mode of action remain obscure . 
The present study was carried out to elucidate the protective and therapeutic role , if any , of glycosides from Hemidesmus indicus against S. typhimurium-induced pathogenesis . 
Studies were carried out in a human intestinal cell line ( Int 407 ) and a murine macrophage cell line ( P388D1 ) in order to evaluate its potency in local as well as systemic infections . 
The inhibitory role of the glycosides present in Hemidesmus indicus root extract ( GHI ) were tested by pre-coating the cells ( both Int 407 and P388D1 ) with GHI prior to infection , and by neutralizing the wild-type bacteria with GHI before cell infection . 
In both cases , GHI protected the host cells from the cytotoxic effects of the wild S. typhimurium . 
This suggests that the biologically signiﬁcant sugars ( hexose , hexosamine , fucose and sialic acid etc ) present in GHI might be mimicking host cell receptor saccharides and thereby blocking the bacterial ligands from binding to the host cells . 
Int 407 cells infected with wild-type bacteria had a diffused adherence pattern after 4 h incubation , but this typical character was not observed in cells infected with GHI-treated bacteria and the cells were normal in appearance at 4 h . 
After 18 h cells infected with wild-type bacteria were hypertrophoid with a disintegrated membrane and wrapped in a bacterial coat , whereas cells infected with treated bacteria had comparatively less morphological changes and few defective shrunken rods adhered locally . 
This suggests that the glycosides can change the adherence pattern of S. typhimurium from diffused to local . 
Treated bacteria had less adherence and invasion capability in Int 407 as well as P388D1 cells . 
The results show the decreased ability of adherence of GHI-treated S. typhimurium was due to a loss of surface hydrophobicity . 
A nonspeciﬁc binding between S. typhimurium and the glycosides was conﬁrmed using ELISA . 
In summary , the glycosides of H. indicus root inhibited S. typhimurium induced pathogenesis nonspeciﬁcally , by reducing bacterial surface hydrophobicity and perhaps also by mimicking host cell receptors , thereby blocking its attachment to host cell and further pathological effects .

INTRODUCTION
With microbial pathogens , successful colonization of mucosal surfaces frequently involves initial binding interactions between proteinaceous attachment factors ( adhesins , lectins and hemagglutinins ) expressed on the surface of microorganisms and complex carbohydrate sequences or receptors on host epithelial cell membrane . 
Many bacterial exotoxins ( e.g. cholera toxin , shiga toxin etc ) also employ a strategy of lectin-like binding to host cell carbohydrate receptors in order to cause their pathophysiological effects . 
It is these speciﬁc lectin -- carbohydrate interactions that often determine the species or tissue tropism for a particular pathogen . 
Conceptually , therefore , it should be possible to use analogs of carbohydrate receptors to competitively

inhibit microbial colonization of host tissues and this hypothesis is the basis for carbohydrate-based antiinfective drugs ( Armstrong , 2000 ) . 
The concept of carbohydrate receptor analogs as antiadhesive drugs for treating infectious diseases is by no means novel ; it was tested in a mouse model for acute urinary infections ( UTIs ) as long ago as 1979 ( Aronson et al. , 1979 ) . 
Pathogenic bacteria that cause UTIs express long ﬁlamentous adhesins called pili or ﬁmbriae that bind to speciﬁc carbohydrate receptors on uroepithelial cells , making them able to resist the signiﬁcant hydrodynamic forces that prevent non-pathogenic bacteria from adhering to tissue sites . 
In the mouse infection model , soluble analogs ( α-mannosides ) of these uro-epithelial cell carbohydrate receptors reduced bacterial colonization of the urinary tract ( Aronson et al. , 1979 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) usually causes a self-limited , acute intes-tinal inﬂammation , manifesting clinically with diarrhea and vomiting , but sometimes it can lead to dissemin-ated , potentially serious infections in old or immune-compromised people . 
It produces a systemic illness in mice that serves as a model for human typhoid fever ( Carter and Collins , 1974 ) . 
One of the most important characteristics of Salmonella virulence is the ability of the organism to invade mammalian cells . 
After it is ingested in contaminated food , Salmonella ﬁrst invades the epithelial cells of the intestine with dramatic host cell membrane rufﬂing ( Francis et al. , 1992 ; 1993 ) , and then , once it has crossed the epithelial barrier , invades and proliferates in the macrophages of the lamina propria and Peyer 's patches ( Jensen et al. , 1998 ) . 
This is an important pathogenic property of these micro-organisms since it allows them to reach deeper tissues and/or to avoid the host defense mechanism . 
The root of Hemidesmus indicus R. Br . 
( Asclepiadaceae ) is widely used in India for a variety of diseases , including rheumatism , leprosy ( Gupta , 1981 ) , impotence and skin infections . 
It is also known for its anti-snake-venom activity ( Alam and Gomes , 1998 ) and as an effective cooling tonic . 
Local people in Orissa , India , use it for diarrhea and dysentery ( Das et al. , 2003a ) . 
The root has a sweet taste and pleasant smell due to its essential oil containing p-methoxy salicylic aldehyde as a major constituent . 
Other constituents known to be present in the roots include β sitosterol , α - and β-amyrins , lupeol , tetracyclic triterpene alcohols , resin acids , fatty acids , tannins , glycosides and a ketone . 
Many plants have reported antimicrobial activity , but most published papers deal with preliminary studies such as MIC determination , disc diffusion or agar well diffusion . 
The antidiarrheal and antienterobacterial activity of the GHI extract has already been demonstrated ( Das et al. , 2003b ; Das and Devaraj , 2006 ) so the present investigation was carried out to explore the protective role ( if any ) and possible mode of action of glycosides derived from H. indicus root . 
The systems chosen for this purpose were S. typhimurium-induced pathogenesis in an epithelial ( Int 407 ) and a murine macrophage ( P388D1 ) cell line .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial maintenance and storage . 
Clinical isolates ( CI ) of Salmonella typhimurium , procured from Christian Medical College , Vellore , India and a standard strain of S. typhimurium ( MTCC 98 ) , collected from Institute of Microbial Technology , Chandigarh , India , were used in this study . 
For routine use , the cultures were maintained on nutrient agar ( Himedia , Mumbai ) plates . 
For long-term storage , glycerol stocks were prepared and stored at − 20 °C . 
Extract preparation . 
The crude methanol extract of Hemidesmus indicus root was prepared according to Das and Devaraj ( 2006 ) , and then its different fractions were prepared by column chromatography . 
Brieﬂy , a 60 -- 120 mesh silica gel G in hexane was used as packing material for a 250 × 15 mm glass column . 
The extract was dissolved completely in chloroform , mixed with packing material and after drying , loaded carefully in the column . 
Different solvent fractions ( hexane , chloroform , ethylacetate , acetone , methanol , ethanol and aqueous ) were collected and stored in a dessicator at 4 °C before use . 
These were screened for anti-S . 
typhimurium activity , and apart from the ethanol and water fractions , all exhibited inhibition zones . 
The effect of the methanol fraction ( yield 6.85 ± 0.15 % ) Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd. of H. indicus root extract was investigated against S. typhimurium-induced pathogenesis in epithelial and macrophage cell lines . 
Positive Molisch 's and Legal 's tests conﬁrmed the presence of glycosides ( Trease and Evans , 1983 ) , and this extract was therefore designated GHI . 
Treatment procedures . 
Preliminary screening tests were carried out by incubating S. typhimurium with different concentrations of GHI . 
Aliquots were plated on LB agar from the LB broth culture of wild and GHI-treated S. typhimurium after adequate dilution , incubated over-night and the number of colonies counted and compared . 
200 µg / mL was determined as the optimum dose for GHI and used in the rest of the studies . 
Prior to each experiment , an actively growing culture of S. typhimurium was diluted in fresh LB broth , incubated overnight ( except for the invasion assay ) without and with the presence of GHI . 
Bacterial cells were harvested and equal numbers of wild and treated bacteria were adjusted and activated by growing them in anti-biotic free tissue culture media for 1 -- 2 h and then added to Int 407 or P388D1 cell line . 
Cell maintenance . 
Int 407 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and maintained in 2 % DMEM at 37 °C in the presence of 95 % air and 5 % CO2 . 
On the day of conﬂuency in 90 mm tissue culture ﬂasks , the cells were trypsinized and subcultured into tissue culture plates or dishes , depending on the study . 
P388D1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 µg / mL gentamicin for 3 -- 4 days at 37 °C , in a humidi-ﬁed 5 % CO2 atmosphere and maintained in 2 % RPMI-1640 . 
Prior to use , they were scraped from the surface of the tissue culture ﬂask , re-suspended in fresh RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and divided into tissue culture plates or dishes depending on the study . 
Toxicity studies . 
Int 407 and P388D1 cells were grown to conﬂuency in 24-well plates . 
Different concentrations of GHI prepared in 0.25 % of dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO ) in 2 % DMEM/RPMI -1640 medium ( for Int 407/P388D1 ) were added and observed microscopically at 3 h , 6 h , 18 h and 24 h . 
One set of wells with only 2 % DMEM/RPMI -1640 , without drug , served as a cell control and one set with 0.25 % of DMSO in 2 % DMEM / RPMI-1640 medium was used to check the cytotoxicity of DMSO ( if any ) . 
The percentage of cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay according to Muller et al. ( 1996 ) . 
Quantiﬁcation of cell associated bacteria and invasion
assay in Int 407 cell line . 
This was carried out according to Weinstein et al. ( 1997 ) . 
Brieﬂy , Int 407 cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 2 days . 
Bacteria grown overnight were diluted 1:100 in fresh high osmolar ( 0.3 M NaCl ) LB medium with and without the presence of GHI ( 100 and 200 µg / mL ) . 
These were grown for 4 h at 37 °C in oxygen limiting ( 5 % CO2 ) ( invasion inducing ) conditions . 
The monolayer was infected with 10:1 multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) . 
To synchronize the infection of monolayers , the infected tissue culture plates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min . 
The cells were then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C , after which the overlying medium was aspirated and washed with PBS . 
The cell-associated ( adhered as well as invaded ) bacteria were released by cell lysis with 0.2 mL 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS incubated for 10 min . 
Samples were vigorously mixed with 0.8 mL of LB broth , aliquots plated after adequate dilutions on LB agar , and then CFUs counted . 
For assessing the extent to which the bacteria had invaded , the infection medium was replaced with 1 mL of tissue culture medium supplemented with 100 µg of gentamicin/mL , incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and then washed with PBS and lysed with 0.2 mL of 1 % Triton X-100 for 10 min . 
The samples were mixed vigorously with 0.8 mL of LB broth , and the viable intracellular bacteria quantiﬁed by plating aliquots on LB agar plates after serial dilutions , and the number of bacteria recovered assessed . 
Invasion and intracellular proliferation assay in P388D1
cell line . 
This was carried out according to Lee and Falkow ( 1990 ) . 
Brieﬂy , invaded bacteria were quanti-ﬁed using the method above , and for intracellular proliferation , the cells were incubated in 2 % RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 µg of gentamicin/mL . 
Cells were lysed at 3 h and 24 h and intracellular bacterial counts were determined as above . 
Inhibition assay . 
The Int 407 and P388D1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates with cover slips , and incubated for 2 days . 
The growth medium was replaced with 2 % DMEM/RPMI -1640 ( for Int 407/P388D1 cells ) containing 200 µg / mL of GHI and incubated for 2 h for pre-coating . 
Wild-type S. typhimurium was neutralized with 200 µg / mL of GHI for 2 h . 
After that , the precoated and uncoated cells were infected with wild-type bacteria and the neutralized bacteria added to the monolayer at a ratio of 50:1 . 
Both positive and negative controls were included . 
The normal monolayers served as a cell control ( negative ) and the uncoated monolayers infected with wild-type S. typhimurium served as a bacteria control ( positive ) . 
The infection process was continued for 4 h . 
The monolayers were then washed with PBS , and the cells grown on cover slips ﬁxed with Carnoy 's ﬁxative ( 1:3 ; acetic acid : methanol ) . 
The ﬁxed Int 407 cells were air dried and stained with Carbol fuschin . 
The cover slips were washed thoroughly with PBS to remove the extra dye , dried , mounted with DPX and observed under phase contrast and light microscope . 
Fixed and dried P388D1 cells were stained with crystal violet and observed under a light microscope . 
Fluorescent microscopy . 
Int 407 cells were grown to conﬂuency and growth medium replaced with 2 % antibiotic free DMEM , then infected with 50:1 MOI ( wild-type ) and GHI-treated S. typhimurium , and incubated for appropriate time intervals ( 4 and 18 h ) . 
The media was decanted , the cells washed with PBS twice , and ﬁxed in 70 % methanol . 
The DNA was stained with 0.5 mg/mL acridine orange in PBS for 15 min , then destained in PBS and observed under a ﬂuorescent microscope . 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . 
Stand-ard methods were followed . 
Brieﬂy , 0.06 M carbonate buffer ( pH 9.6 ) was ﬁrst prepared , and used to dilute Millipore-ﬁltered ( 0.45 µm ) GHI to provide different concentrations ( 0.1 mg , 0.01 mg and 0.001 mg/mL ) . 
BSA was also diluted in carbonate buffer to prepare 0.1 mg , 0.01 mg and 0.001 mg/mL solutions . 
Microtiter plates ( Nunc , Denmark ) were coated with 100 µL of GHI or BSA solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C . 
Blank wells were included , which contained only buffer . 
The wells were washed with PBS-T ( 0.05 % Tween 20 in PBS ) and the non-speciﬁc sites blocked with 2 % skimmed milk powder in PBS-T at 37 °C for 2 h. 100 µL aliquots of wild and GHI-treated S. typhimurium ( 109 bacteria/mL ) were added to the wells in triplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h . 
The plates were washed thee times with PBS-T and incubated with 100 µL of S. typhimurium speciﬁc antisera ( kindly gifted by Dr Simon Daeﬂer , Texas University ) raised in rabbits ( 1:1000 in PBS containing 1 % skimmed milk ) at 37 °C for 1 h , washed thee times with PBS-T and incubated with 100 µL of goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugate ( 1:2000 in PBS containing 1 % skimmed milk ) at 37 °C for 1 h . 
The wells were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with 100 µL of substrate ( DAB/H2O2 ) for 15 min in the dark . 
The reaction was stopped by adding 1N H2SO4 and the OD was recorded at 450 nm by using a microplate autoreader . 
Comparison of surface hydrophobicity in wild and
treated S. typhimurium . 
Bacteria were grown overnight , with and without GHI , centrifuged , suspended in PBS and the OD was measured at 600 nm . 
The duplicate set was treated with xylene and centrifuged . 
The pellet was dissolved in PBS and the OD measured at 620 nm . 
The difference in OD , which is a measure of the loss of protein , was determined ( since they were bound in hydrophobic interactions to the bacterial cell surface ) . 
Tetramethyl urea , a well-known agent for breaking hydrophobic interactions , was also included as a positive control . 
Quantiﬁcation of various biologically signiﬁcant carbo-
hydrates present in GHI . 
GHI was dissolved in 0.1 N H2SO4 to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mg/mL and hydro-lysed for 1 h at 60 °C in a water bath . 
The hydrolysate ( supernatant ) was used for estimation of various sugars using standard procedures : hexose ( Winzler , 1955 ) , hexosamine ( Dische and Borenfreund , 1950 ) , fucose ( Dische and Shettles , 1948 ) and sialic acid ( Warren , 1959 ) . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Determination of CD50 of GHI in Int 407/P388D1 cells: MTT assay
A wide range of concentrations of GHI ( 5 -- 1000 µg / mL ) were tested for cytotoxic effects on Int 407/P388D1 cells seeded in 24-well plates . 
Toxicity studies are very important to indicate the possible safety of the drug under investigation . 
With a concentration of up to 400 µg / mL GHI in Int 407 cells , the monolayer was found to be normal without any altered morphology of the cells . 
However , beyond this , the monolayer appeared as chains of rounded cells . 
The CD50 for GHI was Phytother . 
Res . 
20 , 784 -- 793 ( 2006 ) DOI : 10.1002 / pt determined as 600 µg / mL ( Fig. 1a ) . 
At concentrations up to 600 µg / mL in P388D1 cells , the monolayer was normal and there were no morphological changes . 
Beyond this concentration , cell shrinkage and a disturbed monolayer was observed . 
The CD50 was determined as 800 µg / mL for GHI ( Fig. 1b ) . 
DMSO ( 0.25 % ) , which was used as solubilizing media for GHI , had no cytotoxic effects .

Adherence and invasion of S. typhimurium treated with GHI in Int 407 cells
Invasion of eukaryotic cells and intracellular survival and replication in infected host cells are two hallmarks of S. typhimurium pathogenesis . 
In S. typhimurium , two type-III secretory systems ( TTSS ) are involved in interactions with eukaryotic cells . 
Both TTSS of S. typhimurium are encoded by genes present in patho-genicity islands . 
The TTSS encoded by S. typhimurium pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) mediates the invasion of nonphagocytic cells such as epithelial cells of the intes-tinal mucosa and is involved in enteropathogenesis ( Galan , 1999 ; Wallis and Galyov , 2000 ) . 
The second TTSS encoded by SPI2 is not involved in invasion but is required for the intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella ( Hensel , 2000 ) . 
S. typhimurium binds to its host cell ﬁrst non-speciﬁcally with hydrophobic interactions and then speciﬁcally with a ligand -- receptor interaction . 
Then the type III secretory system becomes activated , releasing a battery of effector proteins into the host cytoplasm , followed by signal transduction , membrane rufﬂing and bacterial internalization into the naturally nonphagocytic epithelial cells ( Suarez and Russmann , 1998 ) . 
Of the wild-type S. typhimurium 26.38 % was found to be associated ( adhered and invaded ) with host epithelial cells after 90 min , whereas GHI-treated bacteria had 4 -- 6 fold less association as 7.1 % and 4.36 % of treated bacteria were associated with their host cells , at a low ( 100 µg / mL ) and high dose ( 200 µg / mL ) , respectively ( Fig. 2a ) . 
The inherent ability of S. typhimurium to invade non-phagocytic cells was abrogated 3 -- 6 fold by treatment with GHI , as 13.18 % of wild S. typhimurium invaded Int 407 cells after 90 min . 
GHI-treated bacteria had only 4.54 % and 2.08 % invasion , respectively , at lower ( 100 µg / mL ) and higher ( 200 µg / mL ) doses ( Fig. 2b ) . 
These ﬁndings suggest that the glycosides might be interfering with the expression of virulence factors associated with adherence and invasion , thereby abrogating both phenomena .

Con-ﬂuent monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of GHI and observed periodically under the microscope and then cell viability was determined by MTT assay . 
50 % cell death or CD50 concentration was determined as 600 µg / mL . 
Values represent the average of three different sets of experiments ( concentrations are in µg / mL ) . 
Invasion and proliferation of S. typhimurium treated with GHI in P388D1 cells
The ability of S. typhimurium to survive and replicate in host cells , including macrophages , is essential for virulence because mutants that fail to replicate in cultured cell lines are avirulent in animals ( Fields et al. , 1986 ; Leung and Finlay , 1991 ) . 
GHI-treated S. typhimurium had 2 -- 3 fold lower invasion rates in comparison with the wild-type , as 28.16 % of wild-type bacteria were found to be invasive in the P388D1 cell line , whereas GHI ( 200 µg / mL ) treated bacteria showed only 12.04 % invasion ( Fig. 3a ) . 
Macrophages are natural phagocytes , so the degree of invasion was higher in the P388D1 cell line compared with the Int 407 cell line for both wild and GHI-treated bacteria . 
The rate of multiplication of GHI-treated S. typhimurium was also less in comparison with the wild-type after 3 h incubation . 
Wild-type bacteria had proliferated 7-fold , whereas treated bacteria increased by less than 3-fold after 3 h. However , the CFU/mL retrieved from cells infected with wild S. typhimurium was negligible , and treated bacteria were retrieved in greater numbers than the wild-type after 24 h incubation ( Fig. 3b ) . 
Salmonella internalization by cultured epithelial cells is followed by an explosive growth phase after a few hours ( Leung and Finlay , 1991 ) . 
This characteristic growth phase is also observed in certain macrophage cell lines . 
Under these permissive conditions , a 10 -- 500 fold increase in intracellular bacteria is observed after 24 h . 
Such aspects as host cell cytotoxicity and heterogeneity of intracellular bacterial populations suggest that these growth parameters are probably underestimated ( Buchmeier and Libby , 1997 ) . 
In contrast to this , at 24 h negligible numbers of wildtype bacteria were retrieved , which might be due to the death and detachment of the host cells , followed by bacterial release and their subsequent destruction by gentamicin treatment . 
As the host cells infected with GHI-treated bacteria had comparatively higher viability than the uninfected cells in MTT and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assays ( data not shown ) , it is possible that the few treated bacteria which had invaded the P388D1 cells were able to proliferate slowly and then exceed the wild-type bacteria . 
This could be an explanation for the higher numbers of retrieved CFUs in the case of the GHI-treated bacteria . 
In Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd. support of our ﬁndings , Monack et al. ( 1996 ) , who compared the intracellular replication of an invasive S. typhimurium ( SL1344 ) and its non-invasive isogenic mutant ( BJ66 ) in a murine macrophage cell line ( RAW 264.7 ) , found that the average number of colonyforming units/well increased for wild-type bacteria over the ﬁrst 8 h of infection and then plateaued . 
Surprisingly , BJ66 replicated at a slightly slower rate for the ﬁrst 8 h , but exceeded the number of intracellular wild-type bacteria by 24 h.

Inhibition by GHI of host-bacterial binding and pathogenesis
S. typhimurium showed a diffused type of adherence pattern in Int 407 cells . 
Some cells infected with wild S. typhimurium were shrunken and rounded with adherent bacteria surrounding them , while the rest were swollen with disintegrated cell membranes ( necrotic ) ( Fig. 4c ) . 
The cells precoated with GHI had normal architecture except for a few rounded cells ( Fig. 4d , e ) and the cells infected with neutralized S. typhimurium with GHI ( Fig. 4f , g ) were as healthy as control cells ( Fig. 4a , b ) . 
This may be due to the blockage of ligand sites in neutralized bacteria , and a competitive inhibition for bacterial binding to host receptor sites by the natural sugars of GHI . 
This could have contributed to the defective adherence of S. typhimurium , thus blocking subsequent damage to the host cell . 
P388D1 cells infected with wild S. typhimurium were swollen with damaged membranes . 
Torn cell sheets with cell clumps were also observed ( Fig. 5b ) . 
GHI pre-coating and neutralization of the bacteria were effective in protecting the P388D1 cells from the cytotoxic effect of S. typhimurium . 
The cells pre-coated with GHI for 2 h and then infected with wild-type S. typhimurium ( Fig. 5c ) , as well as the cells infected with neutralized S. typhimurium with GHI ( Fig. 5d ) , were seen to be normal in appearance without any damage . 
Absence of characteristic pathogenesis in P388D1 cells pre-coated with GHI and cells infected with neutralized bacteria conﬁrmed the results observed in the Int 407 cell line , which suggests that the natural glycosides of GHI may be able to mimic the receptor glycosides on the host cell surface , thus blocking the bacterial ligands from binding to the host cell .

These analogs bind to the adhesin and block the binding site , impairing the adhesive capacity of the bacteria . 
Carbohydrate components that function as receptor analogs have been tested in vivo and it has been proposed that this would reduce the concentration of K88 ﬁmbriated E. coli ( Sutton et al. , 1994 ) . 
The results of the inhibition assay show the efﬁcacy of the natural sugars present in GHI in blocking S. typhimurium-induced pathogenesis , in both epithelial and macrophage cell lines . 
Effect of GHI on adherence efﬁciency and pattern in S. typhimurium
Adherence of pathogenic bacteria to host cells or tissues is a key step in virulence ( Hultgren et al. , 1985 ; Rubino et al. , 1993 ) , so one way of preventing them from causing disease is to inhibit their attachment to epithelial cells in the gut . 
The Int 407 cells incubated with wild S. typhimurium for 4 h showed adherent bacteria all around with less altered morphology ( Fig. 6b ) , whereas the cells were observed as swollen with completely damaged membrane , a characteristic necrotic type of cell death was observed with a diffused bacterial coat around the cells after 18 h incubation ( Fig. 6c ) . 
The cells infected with S. typhimurium , which was preincubated overnight with GHI , had normal morphology with negligible adherent bacteria after 4 h ( Fig. 6d ) . 
After 18 h , a few treated bacteria were adhering locally , with mild morphological changes in the Int 407 cells ( Fig. 6e ) . 
A reduction in the adherence to host cells by GHI-treated bacteria may explain the loss of virulence and pathogenicity in host epithelial cells .

Infection and staining methodology is same as described in Fig. 4 , but cells were stained with crystal violet and observed under light microscope at 100 × .

S. typhimurium binds nonspeciﬁcally to GHI
The speciﬁcity of the binding between S. typhimurium and the natural sugars present in GHI was determined using ELISA . 
The binding of S. typhimurium to 
GHI pre-coated wells was found to be dose-dependent ( Table 1 ) . 
Although the ` R ' value ( the binding para-meter ) was below 2 , which indicates a nonspeciﬁc binding between the two , it was signiﬁcantly less ( approximately 3-fold ) for GHI-treated bacteria in comparison with the wild-type . 
This suggests that the natural sugars present in H. indicus may be capable of mimicking receptor sugars and thus blocking subsequent host -- bacterial interactions . 
Effect of loss of surface hydrophobicity on the adherence of treated bacteria
Surface hydrophobicity is a factor in bacterial virulence , since bacteria with higher hydrophobicity attach more

ﬁrmly to the host cell in a non-speciﬁc manner on ﬁrst contact . 
Loss of surface hydrophobicity can in turn explain the loss of adherence in pathogenic bacteria , so the loss of hydrophobicity in both wild and GHI-treated S. typhimurium was compared after xylene treatment . 
Tetramethyl urea treatment was used as a positive control . 
Wild S. typhimurium had a loss of hydrophobicity of 0.044 units , whereas GHI-treated S. typhimurium had a loss of hydrophobicity of 0.078 ; this can be compared with the 0.099 unit loss of hydrophobicity in tetramethyl urea treated S. typhimurium . 
Non-speciﬁc binding , especially in hydrophobic interactions , plays an important role in the in vitro binding of Salmonella to chicken mucus and enterocytes ( Craven et al. , 1992 ) . 
Adhesion of E. coli HB101 to HeLa cells was also found to be dependent on surface hydrophobicity of bacteria ( Conte et al. , 1994 ) , as does the adhesion of Yersinia enterocolitica to brush border membranes ( Pærregaard et al. , 1991 ) . 
The signiﬁcant loss of surface hydrophobicity in GHI-treated S. typhimurium may therefore be a reason for the weaker binding of GHI-treated bacteria to host cells . 
Mimicry of host cell receptor ligands by sugars present in GHI
The amount of sugars ( hexoses , hexosamine , fucose and sialic acid ) present in GHI was determined ( Table 2 ) . 
The prevalent sugars such as fucose and hexoses in GHI would presumably bind to bacterial ligand sites , thereby blocking further attachment with the host cell receptor . 
This would explain the absence of patho-genicity in cells pre-coated with GHI prior to infection with wild bacteria , or cells infected with neutralized bacteria . 
Guhathakurta et al. ( 1992 ) reported that adhesion of bacteria to guinea-pig colonic epithelial cells in vitro was inhibited by fucose in all of the four strains tested ( two of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and two of S. ﬂexneri ) . 
N-acetyl neuraminic acid and N-acetyl mannosamine also caused inhibition , suggesting

a multiplicity of receptors on the epithelial cell . 
A free , non-immunoglobulin , secretory component from human milk has been found to inhibit hemagglutination of CFA/I ﬁmbriated E. coli ( Giugliano et al. , 1995 ) . 
It was suggested that the oligosaccharide residues of this free secretory component may inhibit E. coli adhesion . 
Some of the saccharides found on the free secretory component are galactose , mannose , fucose , glucosamine and sialic acid ( Purkayastha et al. , 1979 ) , and there are reports that these compounds can function as receptors for many ﬁmbrial adhesins . 
The presence of these sugars in GHI may block the adherence and invasion of S. typhimurium to host cells , explaining the absence of characteristic pathophysiology in cells infected with treated bacteria . 
Because bacterial adhesion is such a critical step for infection , medical researchers are now seriously considering the use of sugars for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections . 
Sugars that selectively inhibit adhesion could act as molecular decoys , intercepting pathogenic bacteria before they reach their tissue targets . 
The phyto oligosaccharides present in the GHI may provide multiple receptor sites for bacterial lectins and thus mimic or compete with epithelial cell membrane receptors . 
Thus the binding of bacteria to glycosides might be protective for the host and enhance host resistance to bacterial infection . 
Further investigation is required to conﬁrm the actual sugar ( s ) involved in blocking the host -- S. typhimurium interaction . 
The present investigation , as a pioneer study , may open new avenues of research for natural medi-cines showing host -- bacterial interactions at a mole-cular level .
