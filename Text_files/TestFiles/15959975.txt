Analysis of flagellin genes was carried out on strains of Salmonella Typhimurium , Salmonella Hadar , Salmonella Abortusequi , Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Gallinarum serovars , using a PCR system designed in this study . 
The purpose of these studies was to explore the flagellin genes of biphasic and monophasic Salmonellae for future targeted genetic interventions . 
The PCR prim-ers were designed for two different structural genes of flagellin ( fliC , fljB ) , for the repressor of fliC ( fljA ) , for the operator region of fliC , and for the invertase system responsible for phase variation in Salmonella ( hin , hixL , hixR ) . 
PCR analysis revealed that all of the examined genes ( fliC , fliC-operator , fljB , fljA , hin , hixL , hixR ) were present in all S. Typhimurium ( n = 10 ) and S. Hadar ( n = 10 ) strains tested . 
The results obtained on S. Typhimurium and S. Hadar strains confirmed their biphasic character at DNA level . 
However , the S. Enteritidis ( n = 46 ) and S. Gallinarum ( n = 5 ) strains lacked the invertase system ( hin , hixL , hixR ) as well as the fljA and fljB genes , while fliC and its operator were detectable . 
Consequently , the S. Enteritidis strains could only express fliC gene resulting in phase H1 flagel-lin . 
The examined S. Gallinarum strains were also demonstrated to have a cryptic flagellin gene ( fliC ) . 
On the other hand , PCR results on S. Abortusequi ( n = 2 ) indicated that both flagellin genes ( fliC , fljB ) and the whole phase variation system were present in both strains tested but only the H2 phase gene ( fljB ) was expressed . 
The phenotype of these strains could be clarified by motility test and/or by classical flagellar serology . 
The findings are also substantiated by the results of serovar-specific PCR for S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis . 
In conclusion , the PCR system developed in this study proved to be suitable for characterisation of Salmonella flagellin genes and confirmed serological results regarding all S. Typhimurium , S. Hadar and S. Enteritidis strains . 
This system could also identify cryptic flagellar genes of S. Abortusequi and S. Gallinarum .

The serological identification of Salmonella serovars is greatly dependent on the production and use of a large number of specific sera raised against different antigenic components of different phases . 
Most Salmonella serovars can be determined based on the serological analysis of the products of two structural genes ( fljB and fliC ) which can be expressed in an alternating way ( biphasic Salmonellae ) or in a single way ( monophasic Salmonellae ) , or not at all ( non-mo-tile or aphasic Salmonellae ) . 
A specific property of the typical biphasic Salmonellae is the presence of the two flagellin genes ( fliC and fljB ) at different locations on the chromosome , expressing different flagellins that could help the bacteria to evade the immune reactions of the host ( Macnab , 1996 ) . 
The genes encoding for the two different phases of flagellar genes ( H1 , H2 ) are highly similar although not identical ( Okazaki et al. , 1993 ) . 
The divergence is most pronounced in the central part of the flagellar sequence and results in distinct antigenicities ( Joys , 1985 ) . 
In the so-called biphasic wild-type cells both products ( H1 , H2 ) are expressed as helical flagellar filaments . 
This is due to the conserved terminal regions of flagellar gene systems in bacteria of biphasic strains . 
At any given time , only one of the two phases is being expressed , and therefore a cell can only posses homologous filaments . 
One of the flagellin genes ( fliC ) codes for the H1 flagellin , while fljB codes for the H2 flagellin . 
The expression of the fliC gene is subject to repression by the product of the fljA gene , which is part of the fljB operon ( Fig. 1A ) . 
As a result the FljA protein develops its repressor effect through blocking the operator region of the fliC flagellin structural gene ( Inoue et al. , 1989 ) . 
Expression of the fljB operon therefore precludes expression of the fliC gene . 
After 103 -- 104 generations the orientation of fljB promoter in the inversion region can be changed . 
As a result , the formerly silent gene is expressed and the expression of the other flagellin gene is turned off . 
Alternating expression of the fljB operon is caused by the inversion of a 1 kb region of DNA upstream of the fljB gene that contains the fljB promoter . 
In phase H2 the fljB promoter is in the correct position and orientation for transcription initiation , while in the other it is not . 
The inversion region is bounded by an inverted repeat ( hixL , hixR ) that permits sitespecific recombination . 
This region also contains the promoter and a coding sequence of the hin gene , whose product is the site-specific recombinase responsible for mediating inversion . 
The hin can be expressed in either orientation , possibly under negative autoregulation to ensure that inversion is a relatively infrequent event ( Craig , 1988 ; Glasgow et al. , 1989 ) . 
However , there are some well-known monophasic serovars and at least one non-motile Salmonella serovar is known , where phase variation does not occur . 
There are several possible explanations of this phenomenon : these serovars ( i ) may be defective in phase variation still having both of their flagellin genes ; ( ii ) may lack their flagellin genes ; ( iii ) or show defective expression ( Jones and Aizawa , 1991 ; Kilger and Grimont , 1993 ; Wray and Wray , 2000 ) . 
The most plausible case -- absence or deletion of the elements of the phase variation system -- is detectable with a PCR testing system . 
In this study we have developed a PCR testing system for the detection of individual genes of the Salmonella phase variation system . 
We have examined several interesting serovars using this screening method . 
The aim of this PCR examination was to explore the flagellin genes of biphasic and monophasic Sal-monellae for future targeted genetic interventions . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
The tested Salmonella strains were isolated in Hungary or abroad from human , poultry or food samples ( Table 1 ) . 
Determination of their serovars was done by the Hungarian Veterinary Reference Laboratory for Salmonella and by the Hungarian National Centre of Epidemiology according to the standard methods ( Edwards and Ewing , 1972 ) . 
Additionally , serological results were confirmed by serovar-specific PCR for S. Typhimurium ( Lin and Tsen , 1999 ) and for S. Enteritidis strains ( Wood et al. , 1994 ) . 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
All of the strains were tested for the presence of genes of the H1 and H2 of Salmonella flagellar systems by PCR . 
Primers designed for amplification of DNA segments of interest , the size of PCR products and the primer sequences are shown in Table 2 . 
Primers were newly designed on the basis of published Salmonella Typhimurium ( hin , hixL , hixR : EM_BA2 : STHINZ ) , ( fljA : EM_BA2 : SFLJA2 ) , ( fljB : EM_BA2 : ST17177 ) or Salmonella Enteritidis ( fliC and its operator region : EM_BA2 : SEFLICC ) sequences choosing conserved parts of the target genes . 
The PCR mastermix consisted of 2.5 µl of 10 × PCR buffer ( MBI Fermentas , Lithuania ) , 2 µl of MgCl2 ( 25 mM ) , 1 µl of dNTPs ( 10 mM ) , 0.5 µl of each primer ( 50 µM ) , 0.25 µl of Taq DNA polymerase ( 5U / µl ) , 1 µl of template DNA and 17.25 µl MQ water . 
The template DNA was prepared according to the culture boiling method . 
PCR amplification was done as follows : one initial denaturation cycle at 94 °C for 3 min , followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s , 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min 30 sec , and one final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min . 
The PCR amplification was performed in an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 ( Applied Biosystems , USA ) . 
Fragments were separated in 1.5 % TBE agarose gel by unidirectional electrophoresis and visualised by staining with ethidium bromide . 
Fragment sizes were determined by comparison with PstI-digested lambda phage DNA ( MBI Fermentas , Lithuania ) . 
DNA sequences were determined using the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , USA ) . 
Computer analysis of sequences was performed with the GCG software package ( Wisconsin Package Version 9.1 ; Devereux et al. , 1984 ) .

Analysis of flagellin genes was carried out on wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium ( n = 10 ) , Salmonella Hadar ( n = 10 ) , Salmonella Enteritidis ( n = 46 ) , Salmonella Gallinarum ( n = 5 ) and Salmonella Abortusequi ( n = 2 ) strains by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . 
The following genes were examined : ( i ) two different structural flagellin genes ( fliC , fljB ) , ( ii ) fljA , the negative regulator of fliC , ( iii ) the operator region of fliC , and ( iv ) the invertase system ( hin , hixL , hixR ) , which is responsible for phase variation in Salmonellae . 
The results are summarised in Table 3 . 
Regarding the tested Salmonella serovars we have found that all of the examined genes ( fliC , fliC-operator , fljB , fljA , hin , hixL , hixR ) were present in S. Typhimurium and S. Hadar strains . 
The results confirm at the DNA level the se-rological knowledge concerning the H antigens of Salmonella , which constitute one of the bases of serogrouping in the Kaufmann-White typing scheme . 
According to this , the S. Typhimurium strains belonging to the B serogroup and the S. Hadar strains belonging to the C2 serogroup possess two different H antigens ( H1 and H2 phases ) . 
Thus , the PCR results show that the invertase system and the genes of both flagellin phases ( fliC and fljB ) are present in the serovars mentioned above ( Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A , B ) . 
In contrast , the S. Abortusequi strains of the B serogroup can only exist in one certain phase ( H2 ) and are unable to change their flagellin phase . 
There are two possible explanations of this . 
One possibility is that the fliC might have mutated , resulting in the expression of only the H2 phase flagellin , thus the cell became monophasic . 
The other possibility is a mutation of the hin site-specific recombinase which is responsible for the phase variation . 
Thus the cell might have become stabilised in the H2 phase ( Hanafusa et al. , 1993 ) . 
In both cases , the bacteria show monophasic phenotype despite the fact that both flagellar structure genes are present . 
Our PCR results support this second possibility , since all of the tested genes were present in the S. Abortusequi strains tested . 
This assumption is governed by the fact that previous studies reported the presence of loss of function mutations in the S. Abortusequi hin invertase gene ( Enomoto , unpublished data ) ( Fig. 1B ) .

Lack of expression of fliC and the lack of flagellin production in S. Gallinarum 
S. Enteritidis , like S. Abortusequi , exhibits only one flagellin phase ( H1 ) ( van Asten et al. , 1995 ) . 
Interestingly this case is the opposite of that of S. Abortusequi . 
Our PCR results confirmed that S. Enteritidis strains lack the fljB gene responsible for the H2 phase ( Fig. 2A ) , the repressor protein gene fljA and the invertase system ( hin , hixL , hixR ) . 
On the other hand , the fliC and its operator were present , expressing constitutively the H1 phase flagellin ( Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B ) . 
A well-known characteristic of S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum strains is the completely non-motile phenotype and the lack of flagellin production ( in contrast to S. Enteritidis , from which they are otherwise indistinguishable ) . 
Nevertheless , we were able to detect the cryptic fliC flagellin gene and its operator region by PCR amplification . 
However , in all probability the fliC carries a significant mutation , which makes flagellin synthesis impossible ( Zinder and Lederberg , 1952 ) ( Fig. 1D and Fig. 2A , B ) . 
Thus , based on the presence of flagellin genes , S. Gallinarum and S. Enteritidis strains are phylogenetically closer to each other than the strains of other serovars ( Li et al. , 1993 ) .

In order to strengthen our results based on classical Salmonella serology and on the use of the flagellar PCR system reported here , we have also applied serovar-specific PCR tests described for S. Typhimurium ( Lin and Tsen , 1999 ) and S. Enteritidis ( Wood et al. , 1994 ) . 
These results were in harmony with other findings and confirmed the classification of all S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis strains ( data not shown ) . 
As mentioned in the introduction , this PCR system was developed to explore the flagellin genes of biphasic and monophasic Salmonellae for future targeted genetic intervention , with the long-range goal to improve live oral Salmo-nella vaccines . 
All these results indicate that our PCR system proved to be suitable for the characterisation of Salmonella flagellin genes and confirmed serological results regarding all S. Typhimurium , S. Hadar and S. Enteritidis strains . 
Furthermore , this system could identify cryptic flagellin genes of S. Abortusequi and S. Gallinarum .
