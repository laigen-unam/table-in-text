A strategy to combat multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) Salmonella in ground beef is urgently needed . 
A national multi-disciplinary meeting reviewed the epidemiology of MDR Salmonella infection and contamination in humans , animals , and retail meat . 
In spite of a recent overall decrease in human MDR Salmonella isolates , certain types , such as Salmonella enterica serotype Newport multidrug-resistant -- AmpC strain and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium deﬁnitive type ( DT ) 104 , have persisted , and several recent large outbreaks of human infection have occurred . 
Key agencies that contribute to a safe ground beef supply were represented at the meeting and contributed to the discussion of possible control strategies from the farm to the table . 
Several of the control strategies suggested are unpopular to some , including restricting the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals , designation of multidrug-resistant Salmonella as an adulterant in ground beef , and improving the mechanisms for product trace-back investigations . 
Nevertheless , enhanced farm-based animal infection control , judicious veterinary and human antibiotic use , regulatory controls , and consumer practices will lead to important industry , veterinary , and public health outcomes .

Because ∼ 38 persons are infected with Salmonella for each person with a laboratory-conﬁrmed infection in the United States [ 8 ] , the human health burden of these outbreaks has been marked . 
Investigations found that infection was associated with consuming ground beef or dairy products and with having direct contact with cattle or cattle environments [ 9 -- 14 ] . 
Two outbreaks warrant further description . 
2002 Outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport infection . 
In 2002 , forty-seven laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of S. Newport were identiﬁed in 5 states [ 9 ] . 
Disease was severe in several cases ; hospitalization was required for 17 patients ( 37 % ) , and there was 1 death . 
Isolates from patients were indistinguishable by PFGE and were MDR , with resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid , ampicillin , cefoxitin , ceftiofur , ce-phalothin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole , and tetracycline . 
Some isolates , referred to as S. Newport MDR-AmpC , were also resistant to kanamycin and had decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone [ 11 ] . 
A case-control study comparing exposures of 36 patients with 85 neighborhood-matched control subjects found an association between S. Newport MDR-AmpC infection and the consumption of raw or undercooked ground beef . 
The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) was notiﬁed . 
A trace-back investigation was conducted , and the ground beef eaten by patients was determined to have derived from a single slaughterhouse . 
However , by the time the plant was implicated , the ground beef produced during the outbreak period was not available for testing , and investigators could not identify the affected production lot of ground beef . 
No ground beef was recalled from the market or consumers ' homes . 
The USDA issued a public health alert reminding consumers about food safety guidelines , including the need to thoroughly cook ground beef . 
Despite this action , patients infected with the outbreak strain were identiﬁed for months after the initial investigation , suggesting that contaminated ground beef continued to be distributed by the implicated plant . 
Because previous S. Newport MDR-AmpC outbreaks have been associated with dairy products [ 14 ] and dairy cattle are an important source of ground beef , this outbreak supports the conclusion that dairy cattle are an important source of human S. Newport MDR-AmpC infection . 
2003 Outbreak of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104 infection . 
In 2003 , ﬁfty-nine laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of MDR S. Typhimurium deﬁnitive type ( DT ) 104 infection were identiﬁed in 9 states [ 10 ] . 
Isolates from patients were indistinguishable by PFGE and were resistant to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole , and tetracycline ( Rtype ACSSuT ) . 
Illness was severe in this outbreak , with 41 % of interviewed patients hospitalized for a mean duration of 4.2 days . 
A case-control study comparing exposures of 27 patients with 71 age - and geographically-matched control subjects found an association between MDR S. Typhimurium DT104 infection and the consumption of ground beef . 
Ground beef was purchased by patients from several grocery stores . 
A traceback investigation of the ground beef supplied to these grocery stores indicated that the ground beef originated from the same large slaughterhouse implicated in the S. Newport MDR-AmpC infection outbreak described above . 
As in the previous outbreak , ground beef produced during the outbreak was not available for testing , and investigators were unable to identify the affected lot of ground beef . 
The USDA again issued a public health alert , but no ground beef was recalled from the market or consumers ' homes . 
Again , patients infected with the outbreak strain were identiﬁed for months after the initial investigation , suggesting that the implicated plant continued to distribute contaminated ground beef . 
The clinical syndrome associated with nontyphoidal Salmonella infection , called salmonellosis , may include cramps , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , and fever . 
Although salmonellosis is usually self-limiting , an estimated 3 % -- 10 % of reported laboratory-conﬁrmed cases result in bacteremia ; young , elderly , and immunocompromised patients are at particular risk [ 1 , 2 ] . 
Recent studies have shown that , compared with patients infected with drug-susceptible Salmonella species , patients infected with mul-tidrug-resistant ( MDR ) Salmonella ( deﬁned as resistance to 11 antimicrobial agent ) are at greater risk of bacteremia , hospitalization , and death [ 3 -- 6 ] . 
Recent outbreaks in the United States have demonstrated that meat products , particularly ground beef , are an important source of MDR Salmonella . 
RECENT OUTBREAKS

REPORT OF A NATIONAL MEETING ON MDR SALMONELLA IN GROUND BEEF
These outbreaks prompted the organization of a national multidisciplinary meeting of physicians , public health ofﬁcials , federal regulatory and health agency ofﬁcials , industry group representatives , veterinarians , and consumer interest group representatives . 
The meeting , `` Ground Beef Contaminated with Multidrug-resistant Salmonella : An Emerging Public Health Concern , '' took place in March 2005 and was hosted by Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine at their campus in Grafton , Massachusetts ; ﬁnancial support was provided by the 
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists ( CSTE ) . 
The purpose of the meeting was to review the epidemiology and microbiology of MDR Salmonella and discuss potential solutions to mitigate the human health consequences of MDR Salmonella infection . 
The meeting included 5 sessions : Human Health Perspective , Veterinary Perspective , Regulatory Perspective , Consumer Perspective , and Industry Perspective . 
Each session included presentations from speakers followed by discussion directed by a speaker panel .

US Epidemiology of MDR Salmonella . 
Prior to 1996 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) monitored the prevalence of MDR Salmonella infection in humans through studies in selected counties . 
Since 1996 , the prevalence of MDR Salmonella infection has been monitored by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System ( NARMS ) through resistance data obtained from isolates collected from humans , animals , and retail meat sources . 
NARMS is maintained through joint collaboration of the CDC ( isolates from humans ) , the USDA ( isolates from animals ) , and the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ( isolates from retail meat ) . 
Human surveillance . 
In 1979 -- 1980 , the prevalence of multidrug resistance in Salmonella isolated from humans was 12 % ( 62 of 511 isolates ) [ 15 ] . 
In 1984 -- 1985 , the prevalence of multidrug resistance increased to 15 % ( 72 of 485 isolates ) [ 15 ] , and , in 1996 , it increased to 31 % ( 404 of 1326 isolates ) [ 16 ] . 
Since 1996 , however , the prevalence of multidrug resistance in Salmonella has decreased . 
In 1997 , a total of 328 ( 25 % ) of 1301 isolates were MDR , and in 2002 , a total of 321 ( 16 % ) of 2009 were MDR [ 16 ] . 
S. Typhimurium is the most commonly isolated serotype from humans in the United States . 
The ACSSuT resistance pattern among S. Typhimurium isolates was 0.6 % ( 1 of 162 isolates ) in 1979 -- 1980 , 5 % ( 7 of 135 isolates ) in 1984 -- 1985 , 7 % ( 8 of 108 isolates ) in 1989 -- 1990 , and 19 % ( 31 of 166 isolates ) in 1994 -- 1995 [ 17 ] . 
According to more-recent 2002 NARMS data , MDR S. Typhimurium ( R-type ACSSuT , AKSSuT [ ampicillin , kanamycin , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole , and tetracycline ] , or ACKSSuT [ ampicillin , chloramphenicol , kan-amycin , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole , and tetracycline ] ) accounts for 98 ( 25 % ) of 393 of S. Typhimurium isolates [ 16 ] . 
Analogous to multidrug resistance in S. Typhimurium , multidrug resistance in S. Newport has also increased . 
In 1998 , 1 ( 1 % ) of 78 S. Newport isolates were S. Newport MDR-AmpC , compared with 53 ( 22 % ) of 239 in 2002 [ 16 ] . 
Animal surveillance . 
In 1997 , the USDA conducted the National Animal Health Monitoring System Beef Study , designed to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella shedding by beef cows on cattle farms throughout the United States . 
Of the 5049 fecal samples collected , 1.4 % yielded Salmonella , of which , 13 % were drug resistant [ 18 ] . 
In 1999 and 2000 , the USDA also conducted the National Animal Health Monitoring System Feedlot Study of cattle in feedlots [ 20 ] . 
Salmonella was isolated from 654 ( 6 % ) of 10,714 fecal samples , of which 82 ( 12 % ) were MDR [ 19 ] . 
Among all 654 Salmonella isolates , 59 ( 9 % ) were S. Newport , of which 58 ( 98 % ) with susceptibility data were MDR . 
Three percent were S. Typhimurium , of which 5 ( 26 % ) of 19 were MDR [ 19 ] . 
A USDA analysis of the Salmonella isolated from healthy animals on farms and in slaughterhouses for NARMS in 2000 found that 183 of the Salmonella isolates were S. Newport , of which 146 ( 80 % ) were MDR [ 20 ] . 
Although this analysis included isolates from chickens , turkeys , swine , and cattle , 98 % of the MDR isolates came from cattle , indicating that cattle may be a more important source of MDR S. Newport than other food animals . 
Furthermore , the USDA data indicate that the prevalence of resistance to several antimicrobial agents among Salmonella isolated from cattle is increasing . 
For example , in isolates obtained from cattle intended for slaughter , the prevalence of amoxicillin resistance was 8 % in 1997 and 21 % in 2003 ; the prevalence of chloramphenicol resistance was 11 % in 1997 and 25 % in 2003 , and the prevalence of tetracycline resistance 31 % in 1997 and 36 % in 2003 [ 21 ] . 
Retail meat surveillance . 
Research studies and FDA NARMS surveillance data consistently show that MDR Sal-monella contaminates meat available for retail purchase . 
A 1998 survey of ground chicken , ground beef , ground turkey , and ground pork in the area of Washington , D.C. , found that 20 % of meat purchased in grocery stores was contaminated with Salmonella ; 82 % of strains isolated were MDR [ 22 ] . 
Although only 3 ( 6 % ) of 50 ground beef samples were contaminated with Salmonella in this survey , 2 of these 3 samples were contaminated with MDR Salmonella [ 22 ] . 
In 2002 , national surveillance found that 9 ( 1.4 % ) of 642 ground beef samples obtained from grocery stores were contaminated with Salmonella ; 22 % of the strains isolated were resistant to 9 antimicrobial agents [ 23 ] . 
Therefore , ∼ 0.3 % of ground beef purchased in grocery stores in 2002 was contaminated with MDR Salmonella [ 23 ] . 
REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS
Several federal , state , and local agencies are responsible for ensuring a safe ground beef supply . 
The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service is responsible for the safety of the meat supply . 
In 1996 , following Escherichia coli O157 : H7 infection outbreaks associated with ground beef , the USDA implemented requirements to control microbial threats in meat and poultry products . 
This system of regulation , called Pathogen Reduction / Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points , introduced product sampling with microbiologic testing to the traditional methods of visual inspections of carcasses . 
As part of the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points regulation , the USDA set Salmonella performance standards ( the maximum proportion of samples that can yield Salmonella ) for slaughterhouses and processing plants . 
Salmonella was selected because it is commonly associated with meat and poultry products and is present in all major species of animal destined for the meat supply . 
Interventions targeting Salmonella will likely lead to concurrent reduction of other enteric pathogens in raw meat and poultry . 
Other agencies that contribute to the safety of the ground beef supply include the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service , which oversees animal health on farms , and the Ag-ricultural Research Service , which conducts food safety research . 
The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine licenses antimicrobial agents used in food animals , including beef and dairy cattle . 
Although all ground beef intended for interstate sale is subject to USDA regulation , individual state food protection agencies have additional authorities to embargo and recall meat when a health threat is determined to be imminent . 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTROL
Meeting attendees proposed and prioritized activities for the prevention of MDR Salmonella infection among humans . 
These activities range from the farm to the table ( table 2 ) and may yield beneﬁts in addition to human health , such as improvements in animal health and animal production . 
Several prevention activities are highlighted below . 
On the farm and feedlot . 
Currently , at least 17 classes of antimicrobial agents are approved by the FDA for animal growth promotion and production efﬁciency on US farms , including tetracyclines , penicillins , macrolides , lincomycin ( an analog of clindamycin ) , and virginiamycin ( an analog of quin-upristin-dalfopristin ) [ 24 ] . 
Multiple types of evidence have demonstrated that farm use of antimicrobial agents promotes the emergence and dissemination of resistance genes among Salmonella and other enteric bacterial pathogens , such as Cam-pylobacter species [ 25 -- 27 ] . 
Public health ofﬁcials and consumer groups advocate the elimination of the overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents in food animals . 
Furthermore , discontinuing the nontherapeutic use ( i.e. , use for growth promotion and feed efﬁciency ) of agents used in humans ( i.e. , penicillin , tetracycline , and others ) is of paramount importance . 
The World Health Organization has called for a risk-based evaluation to determine the human health safety from all antimicrobial agents used in food animals and for the discontinuation of the use of agents that have not been shown to be safe [ 28 ] . 
Furthermore , the World Health Organization has judged several antimicrobial agents to be critically important for human medicine ( i.e. , ﬂuoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins ) and has called for restricted use of such agents in food animals [ 29 ] . 
The US Institute of Medicine has also called for a reduction of antimicrobial agents used in food animals [ 24 ] . 
In 1998 , the European Union implemented a ban on the use of 4 antimicrobial agents used by humans for the purpose of animal growth promotion . 
Preliminary research shows that this ban is having favorable effects on human health with regard to reducing the community reservoir of certain bacteria , such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci [ 30 , 31 ] . 
The FDA modiﬁed its process for the evaluation of the safety of human health with regard to antimicrobial agents used in food animals by requiring a qualitative risk assessment prior to giving approval [ 32 ] . 
However , the process of evaluating antimicrobial agents that are already approved may take years

The World Health Organization advises that priority for such evaluations should be given to products considered to be most important in human medicine [ 28 , 29 ] . 
In the slaughterhouse and during production . 
Cattle slaughter and ground beef production are commonly centralized in relatively few large facilities . 
Meat -- from hundreds to thousands of carcasses -- is often comingled to produce each lot of ground beef . 
During slaughter , enteric bacteria from the intestinal contents of even 1 animal infected with MDR Sal-monella can be mixed throughout a large batch of the ﬁnal product , potentially resulting in the contamination of many tons of meat from a single contaminated carcass . 
Table 2 . 
Farm-to-table opportunities for prevention of human multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) Salmonella infections resulting from contaminated ground beef . 
Recent successful industry and regulatory interventions to control E. coli O157 : H7 provide a model for the control of MDR Salmonella . 
Extensive industry-based microbial sampling and testing programs have been enacted , along with additional voluntary steps by the industry to implement process improvements to reduce fecal contamination during slaughter . 
These slaughter process improvements , aimed at preventing contamination of beef by E. coli O157 : H7 , include the use of acid rinses , chemical dehairing , hide washing cabinets , and steam vacuuming [ 34 -- 37 ] . 
Recent data attest to the success of these approaches to control E. coli O157 : H7 , demonstrating a 42 % reduction in illness [ 38 ] and a 50 % reduction in isolates found in raw ground beef [ 39 ] . 
Concomitant reductions in the presence of Yersinia , Campylobacter , and S. Typhimurium isolates 
have also been noted . 
Irradiation is a well-recognized means of reducing microbial contamination [ 40 ] and is approved by the USDA and the FDA for implementation in the ground beef production process . 
The CDC estimates that 330,000 cases of Salmonella infection , 6000 cases of reactive arthropathy , 4000 hospitalizations , and 140 deaths each year could be prevented if 50 % of the meat and poultry consumed in the United States was irradiated [ 41 ] . 
Unfortunately , despite decades of experience showing safety , some groups maintain that irradiation may reduce product taste and nutritional quality or may result in negative human health consequences . 
Therefore , signiﬁcant national market penetration has occurred slowly . 
Distributors and retailers . 
Contaminated ground beef involved in recent outbreaks of MDR Salmonella infection was purchased by consumers at grocery stores . 
Grocery stores and other retailers commonly require quality assurance guarantees from their suppliers . 
These guarantees should be extended to specify that ground beef provided is free of MDR Salmonella . 
This would provide important market incentives for producers to reduce MDR Salmonella contamination of their ground beef supply . 
Consumers . 
With the recognition that current production methods do not render ground beef free of microbial contamination , the USDA , the CDC , and many other organizations and agencies have encouraged consumers to eat only ground beef that has been cooked to an internal temperature of 160 F 
( 71 C ) . 
However , 1 % -- 3 % of consumers eat pink ground beef each week [ 42 ] ; 29 % of persons who prepare food report usually serving undercooked ground beef ; and one-third of consumers use unsafe food-handling practices , such as not washing their hands and not taking precautions to prevent cross-con-tamination in the kitchen [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , although an effective education campaign far beyond the scope of current efforts might be useful , preventing MDR Salmonella infection in humans clearly requires preconsumer interventions . 
Regulatory agencies . 
E. coli O157 : H7 is considered to be an adulterant by USDA regulation , and as such , its presence in the ground beef supply is subject to the highest level of industry , regulatory , and public health monitoring . 
However , USDA regulations regard enteric bacterial pathogens other than E. coli O157 : H7 to be inherent in raw ground beef . 
Accordingly , MDR Salmonella in ground beef is not considered to be an adulterant , which limits some regulatory actions . 
In spite of a relatively low prevalence of Salmonella contamination in ground beef and laudable reductions in the overall burden of E. coli O157 : H7 in the beef supply , the persistence of and outbreaks associated with S. Newport MDR-AmpC and S. Typhi-murium DT104 in ground beef mandate novel approaches to regulation . 
Strong consideration should be given to designating MDR Salmonella as an adulterant , either routinely or in the context of an outbreak of Salmonella infection . 
In addition , public health alerts that occur in response to an outbreak should include identiﬁcation of the organism and its MDR status . 
Public health authorities . 
In 2001 , the Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance [ 44 ] proposed steps to control MDR Salmonella contamination and infection , including improvement of national surveillance of antimicrobial drug use and resistance , new research , and modiﬁcation of existing FDA approval of antimicrobial agents used in food animals . 
Although some of these steps have been implemented , in view of continued pervasiveness of Salmonella and in rec-ognition of several recent large outbreaks of MDR Salmonella infection , more-urgent action is needed . 
Mandatory veterinary antimicrobial use reporting , which has been implemented in several European countries , would be particularly useful in interpreting antimicrobial resistance surveillance data and targeting focused interventions . 
Currently , all 50 states and US territories have statutes that mandate the reporting of Salmonella infection and the submission of isolates to public health agencies to identify trends and clusters . 
PulseNet , the CDC-based national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance , has improved laboratory methods for detection of clusters of human illness . 
When paired with epidemiologic investigation , PulseNet provides the critical link necessary to detect large or multi-state outbreaks . 
However , the utility of this program depends on real-time analysis of patient isolates , case interviews , and linkage of results to provide epidemiological context for clusters of illness detected by PulseNet . 
Despite its central role in disease surveillance and detection of foodborne bioterrorism , PulseNet functions unevenly across the nation . 
Additionally , the CDC 's capacity as a reference laboratory and national repository for exchange of PulseNet information must be supported with adequate resources . 
Certainly , recent investments in state and local public health agencies have helped improve the capacity for epidemiologic investigation , including enteric disease cluster investigation and standardization of disease surveillance [ 45 ] ; however , the capacity to respond to the ﬁndings of an investigation remains elusive . 
Trace-back investigations are the cornerstone of public health response when an epidemiologic investigation implicates food , such as ground beef , in an outbreak of MDR salmonellosis . 
Trace-back investigations serve at least 3 important goals : ( 1 ) they increase the speciﬁcity of association between product and illness ; ( 2 ) they determine possible source , mode , and extent of contamination of an implicated product ; and ( 3 ) they prevent further cases of illness through regulatory action . 
The 
USDA , FDA , CDC , and state and local health agency roles vary substantially by jurisdiction , geographic distribution of the product , and product type . 
There are examples of successful collaborations among agencies that have prevented additional cases of illness and deaths . 
However , effective trace-back investigations are often hindered by the complexity of product pathways , lack of product package information , standardization of timeframes for investigation , and , in some instances , product patent protections . 
As demonstrated by the S. Newport and DT104 outbreaks described above , when trace-back investigations can not be completed or acted on , cases of illness may continue to occur , and public health authorities may be unable to act . 
In response to some of these concerns , professional organizations advocate for improved trace-back investigational capacity [ 46 -- 50 ] . 
Clinicians . 
Diarrhea is a common clinical presentation , and it is often treated empirically or symptomatically . 
However , the lack of speciﬁc diagnosis can hinder appropriate management [ 51 ] . 
For example , antibiotic treatment of unrecognized , uncomplicated salmonellosis can prolong the carrier state and lead to a higher relapse rate [ 51 ] . 
Appropriate antibiotic therapy can be life-saving for persons with invasive salmonellosis ( e.g. , that may occur in immunocompromised patients ) , but choice of antibiotic is difﬁcult without susceptibility testing of a cultured isolate . 
In addition , identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc organism , such as MDR Salmonella , permits interventions to protect contacts and identify an outbreak of infection , and subsequently , permits public health action , such as source identiﬁcation and control . 
Therefore , according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America , any patient with community-acquired diarrhea lasting 11 day , especially if accompanied by fever , bloody stool , systemic illness , recent use of antibiotics , day-care center attendance , hospitalization , or dehydration , should have a stool sample cultured for the presence of Salmonella , Shigella , and 
Campylobacter species and , in certain circumstances , E. coli O157 : H7 and Clostridium difﬁcile [ 51 ] . 
Clinicians should consider advocating activities that may reduce the prevalence of MDR Salmonella , such as prudent clinical antibiotic use , farm-based reduction of antibiotic use , and irradiation of meat . 
Clinicians also have an immediate responsibility to continue to educate patients regarding proper ground beef cooking and hand washing . 
CONCLUSIONS
A national strategy to combat MDR Salmonella contamination in ground beef is urgently needed . 
Despite the low prevalence of contamination of ground beef by MDR Salmonella , large outbreaks causing signiﬁcant morbidity continue to occur . 
Control of MDR Salmonella may be achieved with its designation as an adulterant in ground beef , granting it the same industry and regulatory attention given to E. coli O157 : H7 . 
Farm-based animal infection control , judicious veterinary and human antibiotic use , regulatory controls , and consumer practices should complement a producer-oriented approach that will lead to important industry , veterinary , and public health outcomes .
