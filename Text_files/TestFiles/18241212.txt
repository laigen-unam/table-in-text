Summary
The mammalian intestine is colonized by a dense bacterial community , called microbiota . 
The microbiota shields from intestinal infection ( colonization resistance ) . 
Recently , we have shown that entero-pathogenic Salmonella spp . 
can exploit inﬂammation to compete with the intestinal microbiota . 
The mechanisms explaining the enhanced pathogen growth in the inﬂamed intestine are elusive . 
Here , we analysed the function of bacterial ﬂagella in the inﬂamed intestine using a mouse model for acute Salmonella Typhi-murium enterocolitis . 
Mutations affecting ﬂagellar assembly ( Fla - ) and chemotaxis ( Che - ) impaired the pathogen 's ﬁtness in the inﬂamed intestine , but not in the normal gut . 
This was attributable to a localized source of high-energy nutrients ( e.g. galactose-containing glyco-conjugates , mucin ) released as an element of the mucosal defence . 
Motility allows Sal-monella Typhimurium to beneﬁt from these nutrients and utilize them for enhanced growth . 
Thus , nutrient availability contributes to enhanced pathogen growth in the inﬂamed intestine . 
Strategies interfering with bacterial motility or nutrient availability might offer starting points for therapeutic approaches .

to interfere with colonization and deter invading pathogens . 
These include chemical barriers ( antimicrobial peptides , bile salts , lysozyme , lipases , pH ) , mechanical barriers ( epithelium , mucus ) and innate and adaptive immune responses . 
In addition , the intestinal lumen is colonized by a dense bacterial community called the ` microbiota ' ( Xu and Gordon , 2003 ) . 
The microbiota protect efficiently against intestinal colonization by most enteric pathogens ( ` colonization resistance ' ) . 
This phenomenon is still not entirely understood . 
Recently , we have shown that Salmonella subspecies I serovar Typhi-murium ( S. Typhimurium ) can exploit intestinal inﬂammation to out-compete the microbiota ( Stecher et al. , 2007 ) . 
Inﬂammation was necessary and sufficient to shift this competition in favour of the pathogen . 
However , the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive . 
It is unknown which elements of the host defence ( e.g. anti-microbial compounds , increased release of high-energy nutrients like glycoproteins , etc. ) deﬁne the hallmarks of this altered ecosystem and which virulence factors enable the pathogen to exploit them . 
Here , we used a mouse model for acute Salmonella Typhimurium enterocolitis to study the function of bacterial motility in the inﬂamed intestine . 
Salmonella Typhimurium is a Gram-negative pathogen causing enterocolitis in humans and livestock . 
Pathogenesis of these medically and economically important infections can be studied in a mouse model for Salmonella enterocolitis . 
In this model , the commensal microﬂora is transiently reduced by streptomycin treatment allowing S. Typhimurium to efficiently colonize the intestine and elicit colitis , a pronounced inﬂammation of the cecum and colon ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ; Coombes et al. , 2005 ; Hapfelmeier and Hardt , 2005 ; Stecher et al. , 2005 ; Becker et al. , 2006 ; Suar et al. , 2006 ) . 
Multiple S. Typhimurium virulence factors contribute to the induction of colitis , including the two-type threesecretion systems ( referred to as TTSS-1 and TTSS-2 or T1 - and T2 - in case of the respective mutants throughout this paper ) and ﬂagella ( Stecher et al. , 2004 ; Coburn et al. , 2005 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Flagella are surface structures propelling bacteria towards favourable environments . 
Directional movement ( ` chemotaxis ' ) towards nutrient reservoirs requires chemosensors ( ` chemotaxis receptors ' ) , signal integration and regulated ﬂagellar rotation .

Flagella are key virulence factors of many bacterial pathogens . 
Often , they have pleiotropic phenotypes including chemotaxis , adherence , host cell invasion , colonization and innate immune signalling ( Josenhans and Suerbaum , 2002 ) . 
This has prohibited unequivocal conclusions about ﬂagellar function in host infection . 
In the mouse model for S. Typhimurium colitis , mutations disrupting ﬂagellar biosynthesis or chemotactic movement attenuate disease and reduce bacterial ﬁtness in competitive infection experiments ( Stecher et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , the functional role of ﬂagella during the acute enteric infection has remained unclear . 
Here , we used the streptomycin mouse model to study why ﬂagella enhance S. Typhimurium ﬁtness in the inﬂamed intestine . 
We analysed the function of ﬂagella in the presence and absence of intestinal inﬂammation . 
Our ﬁndings establish that mucosal inﬂammation provides a localized source of high-energy nutrients . 
Motility in turn enhances the pathogen 's ﬁtness because it allows accessing these nutrients resulting in faster rep-lication . 
This implies that nutrient availability ( and efficient access to these nutrients ) plays an important role in gut colonization by S. Typhimurium in the infected host . 
Results
S. Typhimurium requires ﬂagella for colonizing the inﬂamed but not the non-symptomatic intestine
Flagella are important virulence factors of enteropatho-genic bacteria . 
We showed earlier , that S. Typhimurium requires ﬂagella for efficient replication in the lumen of an inﬂamed intestine ( Stecher et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , the selective pressure favouring motile bacteria in the gut lumen is still unclear . 
We speculated that some feature of the inﬂamed intestine ( e.g. neutrophil inﬂux , altered anti-bacterial defences or nutrient availability ) which may be lacking in the non-symptomatic intestine might drive this selection . 
To test this hypothesis we used the streptomycin-pretreated mouse model and applied two different experimental approaches . 
First , we studied the role of motility in the genetic background of the attenuated S. Typhimurium strain T1-T2 - [ M557 ; deﬁcient in type three secretion via TTSS-1 and TTSS-2 ; Table 1 ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) ] . 
T1-T2 - efficiently colonizes the intestinal lumen for 3 days but is incapable of triggering colitis by itself ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ; Stecher et al. , 2007 ) .

T1-T2 - which lacks a key element of the signalling cascade controlling chemotaxis . 
To measure the selective advantage ( competitive index , CI ) , ﬁve mice were infected with a 1:1 mixture of T1-T2 - and T1-T2-Che - ( 5 ¥ 107 cfu intragastrically ( i.g. ) ) . 
As expected , no intes-tinal inﬂammation was detected ( Fig . 
S1A ) and T1-T2-did not have a competitive advantage over T1-T2-Che-in the normal gut ( P > 0.05 ; Fig. 1A ) . 
In contrast , in the presence of inﬂammation [ infection with isogenic wild type strains M964 ( Che - ) versus SB300 ( wild type ) ] , Che - was out-competed by wild type ( P = 0.008 ) . 
Competitive infection experiments with a strain completely lacking ﬂagella [ M933 ( Fla-T1-T2 - ) versus M557 ( T1-T2 - ) ; M913 ( Fla - ) versus SB300 ( wild type ) ] yielded identical results ( Fig . 
S1B and C ) . 
Thus , ﬂagella-based movement strongly enhances ﬁtness of S. Typhimurium in the intestinal lumen -- but only in the inﬂamed gut . 
This was conﬁrmed in an alternative approach using knockout mice ( MyD88 - / - ) lacking a central element of the innate immune system ( Takeda and Akira , 2005 ) . 
A T1-strain ( SB161 ; DinvG ) can not trigger colitis in MyD88 - / - mice . 
In contrast , wild-type C57BL/6 mice ( MyD88 + / - or MyD88 + / + ) develop colitis after 3 days of infection with T1 - ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
This allowed us , using the same pair of bacterial strains , to compare the ﬁtness of Che + and Che - S. Typhimurium strains in the presence or absence of inﬂammation . 
In competitive infection experiments , groups of MyD88 - / - and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected with a 1:1 mixture of T1 - and T1-Che - ( M944 ; Tables 1 and 5 ¥ 107 cfu i.g. ) . 
Total S. Typhimurium fecal and systemic loads were comparable to previous experiments ( Fig . 
S1 ) . 
As expected , wild-type C57BL/6 mice developed colitis and T1 - outcompeted T1-Che - in these animals by day 4 post infection ( p.i. ; P = 0.008 ; Fig. 1B ) . 
In contrast , MyD88 - / - mice did not develop colitis and the ratio of T1 - versus T1-Che-did not change signiﬁcantly between days 1 and 4 p.i. ( P > 0.05 ; Fig. 1B ; Fig . 
S2A -- C ) .

S. Typhimurium Che - and Fla - mutants are defective in colonizing the inﬂamed but not the non-symptomatic intestine . 
A. Streptomycin-pretreated wild-type C57BL/6 mice ( n = 5 ) infected for 3 days with 1:1 mixtures ( total 5 ¥ 107 cfu intragastrically ( i.g. ) ) of S. Typhimurium strains T1-T2-Che - ( M965 ) and T1-T2 - ( M557 ; closed circles ) or Che - ( M964 ) and wild type ( SB300 open circles ) . 
B. Streptomycin-pretreated MyD88 - / - ( n = 9 ; closed circles ) or C57BL/6/MyD88 + / - mice ( n = 8 ; open circles ) were infected ( 5 ¥ 107 cfu i.g. ) for 4 days with a 1:1 mixture of S. Typhimurium strains T1 -- Che -- ( M944 ) and T1 -- ( SB161 ) . 
C. Streptomycin-pretreated MyD88 - / - ( n = 10 ; closed circles ) or C57BL/6/MyD88 + / - mice ( n = 9 ; open circles ) were infected ( 5 ¥ 107 cfu i.g. ) for 4 days with a 1:1 mixture of S. Typhimurium strains T1-Fla - ( M583 ) and T1 -- ( SB161 ) . 
Competitive indices ( CI ) for the pairs of isogenic Che - / Che + or Fla - / Fla + strains were deﬁned at day 1 in the feces and at days 3 or 4 p.i. in the cecal content . 
Cecal tissues were embedded and inﬂammation ( or lack thereof ) was conﬁrmed by histopathological evaluation of HE-stained tissue sections ( Figs S1 and S2 ) . 
Representative images are shown above .

n.s. , not statistically signiﬁcant ( P = 0.05 ) ; P = difference of CI between days 1 and 3/4 p.i. ; dotted line , limit of detection ; black bar , median . 
Similar results were obtained in competitive infection experiments with T1 - and T1-Fla - ( M583 ; Table 1 ) , an isogenic non-ﬂagellated mutant ( Fig. 1C ; Fig . 
S2D -- F ) . 
Additional control experiments conﬁrmed that the results were not skewed by the choice of the antibiotic resistance cassettes tagging the different strains ( Fig . 
S1D ) . 
In conclusion , it did not make a difference whether bacterial motility was disrupted at the level of ﬂagellar expression or directed movement . 
These data conﬁrm that bacterial motility enhances S. Typhimurium ﬁtness in the intestinal lumen but only in case of an inﬂamed gut . 
Thus , the inﬂamed intestine must display features favouring motile over non-motile strains of the pathogen . 
Motility increases the S. Typhimurium growth rate in the inﬂamed intestine 
Next , we sought to identify the principal mechanism explaining the improved ﬁtness of ﬂagellated , chemotactic S. Typhimurium strains in the inﬂamed intestine . 
Superior ﬁtness could be explained by ( i ) enhanced growth rates of the ﬂagellated , chemotactic strains , ( ii ) reduced resistance of non-ﬂagellated or non-chemotactic strains to defensive mechanisms ( e.g. reactive O - or N-intermediates , phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides ) and ( iii ) resisting wash-out through exacerbated peristaltic transport in the inﬂamed bowel . 
We used the temperature-sensitive plasmid pHSG422 ( Benjamin et al. , 1990 ) and its variant pM1419 ( lacking chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance markers ) to analyse bacterial growth rates and to distinguish between these mechanisms . 
At 27 °C pHSG422 and pM1419 can replicate ( i.e. in vitro ) and each daughter bacterium harbours the plasmid after cell division . 
At 37 °C ( upon inoculation of the mouse ) the plasmids can not replicate and after cell division only one of the two daughter bacteria retains the plasmid . 
Pilot experiments using pHSG422 indicated that S. Typhimurium strains triggering colitis ( i.e. SB300 pHSG422 ) grew at higher rates than strains failing to trigger colitis ( i.e. T1-T2 - pHSG422 ; data not shown ) . 
Competitive infection experiments were performed to compare growth rates of the motile strain T1-T2-ampR ( M984 ; Table 1 ) and the non-motile strain T1-T2-Fla - ( M933 ; tetracycline resistant ; Table 1 ) in vivo side by side . 
Mice were infected for 1 day with 1:1 mixtures of T1-T2-ampR ( M984 pHSG422 ) and T1-T2-Fla - ( M933 pHSG422 ; in total 5 ¥ 107 cfu i.g. ) in the presence ( inﬂammation ) or absence ( no inﬂammation ) of wild-type S. Typhimurium ( 15 ¥ 107 cfu i.g. ) . 
In mice with inﬂammation , T1-T2-ampR out-competed the isogenic non-motile strain and lost pHSG422 at a signiﬁcantly higher frequency ( Fig. 2A ) . 
However , in the absence of inﬂammation growth rates of both strains did not differ signiﬁcantly . 
These results were conﬁrmed in competitive infection experiments using the motile , chemotactic strain T1-T2 - ( M318 ; kanR cmR ; Table 1 ) and its isogenic chemotaxisdeﬁcient variant T1-T2-Che - ( M965 ; kanR tetR ; Table 1 ) bearing the temperature-sensitive plasmid pM1419 ( ampR ) . 
Again , growth of T1-T2 - was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence of inﬂammation ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Therefore , bacterial motility was required for enhancing pathogen growth in the inﬂamed intestine . 
To study possible effects of the fecal transit time in the large intestine , we analysed the frequency of defecation in inﬂamed and non-inﬂamed mice . 
The number of fecal pellets shed per mouse did not differ signiﬁcantly between both groups of mice at day 1 and day 2 p.i. ( Fig. 2B ) . 
If anything , the inﬂamed mice tended to shed even slightly reduced numbers of fecal pellets by day 2 p.i. . 
This indicated that intestinal contents were travelling with approximately equal rates in both groups of mice , at least in the large bowel . 
Thus , preferential ` wash-out ' of the nonmotile mutants can not explain the reduced ﬁtness of these mutants in the inﬂamed gut . 
This led us to conclude that the competitive advantage in the inﬂamed intestine can be attributed to faster growth of ﬂagellated , motile strains ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Flagellated subpopulations accumulate proximal to the mucosa
Next we analysed mechanisms contributing to the superior intestinal growth rates of ﬂagellated S. Typhimurium strains . 
Movement into nutrient-rich gut regions could provide an explanation . 
To test this hypothesis we analy-sed the localization of wild-type S. Typhimurium , non-ﬂagellated and non-chemotactic mutants in the cecal lumen . 
The strains harboured the reporter plasmid pFLIC , expressing GFPmut2 under control of the ﬂiC promoter pﬂiC . 
pﬂiC is , as a ` class III promoter ' of the ﬂagella regulon , only expressed during ﬁnal steps of ﬂagella biosynthesis ( Aldridge and Hughes , 2002 ) . 
In line with previous reports ( Cummings et al. , 2006 ) only a fraction of the bacteria in a given LB culture expressed ﬂagella as indicated by the percentage of GFP + bacteria [ wild type ( pFLIC ) : 61 20 % ; T1-T2 - ( pFLIC ) : 56 19 % ; T1-T2-Che - ( pFLIC ) : 45 24 % ] . 
Streptomycin-pretreated mice were infected for 1 day with pFLIC-carrying strains and we analysed the localization of GFP + and GFP-S . 
Typhimurium in the cecum by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy ( Fig. 3 ; Fig . 
S3 ) . 
Deep inside the cecal lumen , the fraction of GFP + wild type ( pFLIC ; triggers colitis ) was low ( 40 -- 60 % ) . 
The proportion of GFP + bacteria increased near the epithelium and was maximal in close proximity ( < 200 mm ) to the cecal epithelium ( 92 9 % ; Fig. 3 ) . 
This suggested that a substantial part of the ﬂagellated fraction of the wild-type S. Typhimurium population accumulated at the epithelium . 
Infection with T1-T2 - ( pFLIC ) did not yield inﬂammation and approximately 40 % of the bacteria expressed the reporter deep inside the intestinal lumen ( Fig. 3A ; Fig . 
S3 ) . 
In the small zone adjacent to the cecal epithelium , GFP-expressing T1-T2 - ( pFLIC ) Salmonella were highly enriched . 
Control experiments veriﬁed that this was not attributable to enhanced ﬂuorophore maturation ( see T1-T2 - with pM979 ; constitutive GFP expression ; Fig. 3A ) or to increased expression levels of the pFLIC reporter in oxygen - and nutrient-rich zones near the gut epithelium ( Fig . 
S4 ) . 
Thus , our data suggest that motility allows S. Typhimurium to home towards the epithelium of the non-inﬂamed gut . 
To explore the role of chemotaxis in homing to the gut epithelium , we have analysed two different T1-T2-Che-strains [ M946 ( pFLIC ) and M963 ( pFLIC ) ; Table 1 ] . 
With both strains , we did not detect enrichment of the pFLICexpressing bacteria near the epithelial surface ( Fig. 3A ) . 
This indicated an important role for chemotaxis . 
However , - -- both T1 T2 Che strains yielded only ~ 10 % of GFP-positive bacteria in the gut lumen . 
This was in contrast to data obtained in LB medium in vitro ( 45 24 % GFP-positive bacteria ) . 
Therefore , we performed a control experiment to verify functional expression of ﬂagella by the T1-T2-Che - strains in the gut . 
We extracted cecal contents from mice infected for 1 day with T1-T2 - [ M557 ( pM979 ) ] or T1-T2-Che - [ M963 ( pM979 ) ] and analy-sed bacterial motility by time-lapse microscopy ( GFP-ﬂuorescence ) . 
Chloramphenicol was added to prevent de novo ﬂagellar protein synthesis . 
T1-T2 - and T1-T2-Che-bacteria were swimming at the same speed ( ~ 12 -- 15 mm s-1 in ` run ' phases ; P > 0.05 ; Fig. 3B ) . 
This suggested that T1-T2-Che - strains were fully motile ( but non-chemotactic ) . 
The reason for the low expression ( 10 % versus 45 % ) of the GFP-reporter by T1-T2-Che - ( pFLIC ) in vivo has remained unclear and represents a subject for further investigation . 
Nevertheless , these data suggest that the S. Typhimurium population in the gut lumen homes to the epithelium via chemotaxis . 
Therefore , gradients of some type of chemo-attractant ( i.e. nutrients ) must emanate from the intestinal wall . 
Glycoconjugate distribution in the murine cecum Nutrient gradients could drive S. Typhimurium chemotaxis towards the epithelium . 
Oxygen , amino acid or sugar gradients might also be sensed . 
Intestinal mucins are one likely source of nutrient gradients ( Wadhams and Armit-age , 2004 ) : Mucins ( i.e. Muc2 ) are produced in large quantities by the ` goblet cells ' of the large intestine . 
They cover the intestinal epithelium at a high density , are highly glycosylated ( up to 50 Mol % sugar modiﬁcations , i.e. galactose , fucose ) and they are a known energy source for commensal bacteria as well as for S. Typhimurium ( Ketyi , 1988 ; McCormick et al. , 1988 ; Sonnenburg et al. , 2005 ; 2006 ; Stecher et al. , 2006 ) . 
Moreover , insults such as mechanical forces ( or inﬂammation ) are known to increase mucus secretion ( Deplancke and Gaskins , 2001 ; Miyake et al. , 2006 ; McAuley et al. , 2007 ) . 
Several observations indicate that Salmonella-induced colitis results in increased mucin secretion by the cecal mucosa : i . 
The inﬂamed cecal mucosa harboured similar goblet cell numbers per optical ﬁeld than the normal cecal mucosa . 
This was found by immunoﬂuorescence staining for a goblet cell-speciﬁc Muc2 precursor ( non-O-glycosylated Muc2 ; Fig . 
S5 ) . 
ii . 
Each goblet cell in the normal intestine harbours multiple mucous storage vesicles . 
In contrast , goblet cells of the inﬂamed mucosa harboured virtually none . 
This pointed to increased mucin secretion rates . 
iii . 
Increased amounts of glyco-conjugates were detected in the lumen of the inﬂamed intestine ( see intense UEA-1 and CGL-2 stains in Fig. 4A ) . 
The lectins Ulex

A. Analysis of the replicative index . 
Four groups of streptomycin-pretreated mice were infected with 1:1 mixtures of isogenic S. Typhimurium strain pairs : ( i ) M984 ( T1 -- T2 -- ampR ; kanR ampR ) and M933 ( T1-T2-Fla - ; kanR tetR ; 5 ¥ 107 cfu in total ; circles ) harbouring pHSG422 ( cmR ) at time of infection ( > 99 % ) . 
( ii ) The motile , chemotactic strain T1-T2 - ( M318 ; kanR cmR ) and the non-chemotactic strain T1-T2-Che -- ( M965 ; kanR tetR ; 5 ¥ 107 cfu in total ; triangles ) bearing the temperature-sensitive plasmid pM1419 ( ampR ) . 
If indicated , colitis was generated in trans ( pink ) by co-infecting with 15 ¥ 107 cfu S. Typhimurium wild type ( kmS ampS cmS tetS ) . 
The replicative index was determined by differential plating as described in Experimental procedures . 
Asterisks indicated a signiﬁcant difference between the respective groups : * P = 0.019 ; ** P = 0.029 . 
B. Frequency of defecation . 
Groups of six mice were pretreated with streptomycin , housed in separate cages and infected with either wild-type S. Typhimurium ( SB300 ; triggers inﬂammation ) or the isogenic T1-mutant ( SB161 ; no inﬂammation by day 2 p.i. ) . 
The numbers of fecal pellets were counted at days 1 and 2 p.i. ; n.s. no statistically signiﬁcant difference . 
There was a striking enrichment of the S. Typhimurium subpopulations expressing ﬂagella ( pFLIC reporter ) in regions intensively stained by UEA-1 / CGL-2 ( Fig. 4B ; see also Figs 3 and 4A ) . 
This suggested that intestinal mucins ( or other glycoproteins ) might represent a source for the nutrient gradients attracting chemotactic S. Typhimurium strains to regions close to the intestinal epithelium . 
Effect of galactose-feeding and expression of the mglBAEC operon by mucus-associated S. Typhimurium
Next we analysed the chemotactic cues attracting S. Typhimurium towards the cecal mucosa . 
Galactose residues were present in high abundance at the cecal mucosa ( Fig. 4A ) and S. Typhimurium is known to express genes encoding galactose uptake and utilization systems in the cecal lumen ( Becker et al. , 2006 ) . 
Thus , a galactose concentration gradient might represent one of many possible chemotactic cues attracting

A. Accumulation of GFP-expressing bacteria in regions close to the cecal epithelium ( x-axis ) . 
Cecal tissue samples from streptomycin-pretreated mice infected with T1-T2 - ( M557 pFLIC ; 4 mice ; open circles ) , wild type ( SB300 pFLIC ; 7 mice ; closed triangles , red line ) , S. Typhimurium T1-T2-Che - ( M946 pFLIC ; 3 mice ; open triangles ) , S. Typhimurium T1-T2-Che - ( M963 pFLIC ; 3 mice ; blue triangles ) and T1-T2 - [ M557 pM979 ( constitutive ribosomal promoter pRPSM ) ; 3 mice ; closed circles ] were analysed with respect to GFP expression in individual bacteria located at the indicated distance from the epithelium . 
B. Speed of swimming of GFP-expressing bacteria isolated from cecal contents analysed by time-lapse microscopy . 
Cecal contents were extracted from mice infected for 1 day with T1 -- T2 -- ( M557 pM979 ; open circles ) or T1-T2-Che - ( M963pM979 ; blue triangles ) and analysed bacterial motility by time-lapse microscopy in HBSS supplemented with chloramphenicol to prevent de novo ﬂagellar protein synthesis . 
Time-lapse movies were recorded and the speed of swimming of bacteria in ` run ' phases was determined . 
europaeus agglutinin ( UEA-1 ) and galectin ( CGL-2 ; Walser et al. , 2005 ) bind terminal a-1-2-linked fucose and galactose , which are abundant glycosyl-modiﬁcations of the mucins ( Thomsson et al. , 2002 ) . 
Thus , mucosal inﬂammation encompassed increased release rates of glycoconjugates , including mucins . 
S. Typhimurium towards the intestinal epithelium . 
Indeed , we found that T1-T2 - ( pFLIC ) failed to accumulate at the epithelium if D-galactose was supplied in excess to the intestinal lumen by repeated gavage ( untreated versus mice treated three times with 100 ml 100 mM D-galactose per os ; P < 0.001 ; Fig. 4B ) . 
We veriﬁed that galactose supplementation had no effect on pﬂiC expression in vitro ( Fig . 
S6A ) . 
In contrast , repeated gavage with L-fucose , which is a growth substrate for S. Typhimurium ( J. Guntern , K. Ehrbar and W.-D . 
Hardt , unpubl . 
results ) but does not elicit chemotactic responses by various bacteria including S. Typhimurium ( Koshland , 1979 ; Adler , 1969 ; our own observations ) did not yield this effect ( untreated versus L-fucose P > 0.5 ; Fig. 4B ) . 
This suggested that galactose may belong to the cues forming the chemotactic gradient attracting S. Typhimurium towards the mucosal surface . 
To verify galactose utilization by the mucus-associated bacteria we used the reporter plasmid pMGLB . 
This plasmid expresses GFP via the promoter of the mglBAEC operon which encodes a high-affinity ABC transporter for galactose uptake ( Muller et al. , 1985 ) . 
We veriﬁed that gfp expression of pMGLB is induced in the presence of D-galactose in vitro ( Fig . 
S6B ) . 
In general , infection with wild-type S. Typhimurium ( pMGLB ; inﬂammation ; red symbols ) yielded much higher levels of reporter expression than infection with T1-T2 - ( pMGLB ; no inﬂammation ; Fig. 4C and D ; blue symbols ) . 
This correlated with the increased mucin levels in the inﬂamed intestine ( UEA-1 and CGL-2 stain ; Fig. 4A ) . 
Moreover , mucus-associated bacteria showed particularly high levels of mglB promoter activity ( Fig. 4E ) . 
These data indicated that S. Typhimurium can sense D-galactose gradients emanating from the cecal mucosa and beneﬁt from this local nutrient source via chemotaxis . 
The inﬂamed mucosa secretes particularly high levels of mucus glycoproteins . 
Thus , efficient access to this localized source of high-energy nutrients can explain the ﬁtness beneﬁt of ﬂagellated and chemotactic S. Typhimurium strains in the inﬂamed murine intestine .

Discussion
We used an in vivo infection model to study how ﬂagella enhance S. Typhimurium colonization of the host 's intestine . 
This work revealed two fundamental principles explaining why ﬂagella can improve pathogen ﬁtness during an acute mucosal infection : ( i ) mucosal inﬂammation encompasses elevated , localized nutrient availability , particularly near the infected mucosa , and ( ii ) motility allows efficient access to these localized high-energy nutrients . 
This explains the increased growth rates of ﬂagellated S. Typhimurium strains in the inﬂamed intestine . 
Nutrients in the inﬂamed intestine
We identiﬁed localized nutrient availability in the inﬂamed intestine as an important factor in enteric S. Typhimurium infection . 
How is this linked to inﬂammation ? 
Our data indicate that inﬂammation has two different fundamental effects on the pathogen . 
First of all , inﬂammation serves to limit infection . 
This effect is well established and several mouse lines with genetic defects in inﬂammatory response pathways are hyper-susceptible to systemic spread of the pathogen ( Vazquez-Torres et al. , 2000 ; Eckmann and Kagnoff , 2001 ; Weiss et al. , 2004 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
A second effect has been identiﬁed , recently : Inﬂammation provides S. Typhimurium with a means to colonize the host 's intestine by successfully competing with the indigenous microbiota ( Stecher et al. , 2007 ) . 
Here , we found that the enhanced ﬁtness of S. Typhimurium in the inﬂamed intestine is attributable at least in part to the local release of high-energy nutrients by the mucosa as a result of the inﬂammatory response . 
The latter explains elevated growth rates of S. Typhimurium ( inﬂamed versus normal intestine ) and the increased ﬁtness of ﬂagellated , chemotactic bacteria . 
Glycoconjugates seem to play a key role in this as indicated by lectin-staining and upregulation of galactose utilization operons by the pathogen . 
Serum leakage into the intestinal lumen , debris from transmigrating PMN , remains of shed epithelial cells and in particular the highly glycosylated proteins ( mucins ) forming the mucous layer may contribute to this energy-rich glyco-conjugate pool . 
Mucus is stored in vesicles of the goblet cells and secreted into the intestinal epithelium . 
Epithelial damage , as observed in S. Typhimurium colitis ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) , is known to trigger mucus secretion ( Miyake et al. , 2006 ) . 
Normally , this response serves tissue protection and repair . 
But at the same time the mucins represent a local source of high-energy nutrients . 
Mucins are highly modiﬁed by O-linked oligosaccharides harbouring approimately 50 % N-actetyl glucosamine , sialic acid , fucose and galactose residues . 
Our data show that the localized nature of these nutrients yields a selective growth advantage for virulent , motile S. Typhimurium strains . 
Non-motile S. Typhimurium strains are attenuated and can not beneﬁt to the same extent . 
Thus , the acute inﬂammatory response of the host 's intestinal mucosa does not simply limit the infection . 
At the same time it provides a rich source of nutrients and generates a selection pressure favouring highly virulent , motile bacteria . 
Chemotaxis versus enhanced growth at the mucosal surface
The accumulation of wild-type S. Typhimurium at the mucosal surface might be explained by two different mechanisms . 
One may argue that directed and non-directed motility equally allow access to this nutrient-rich environment . 
There , bacteria may grow faster than in the nutrient-poor gut lumen . 
Thus , the pFliC-expressing bacteria may grow and accumulate right at the mucosal surface ( enhanced growth on site ; Fig. 3A ) . 
However , two observations seem to argue against this ` growth only ' explanation . 
First of all , cheY strains can get close to the mucosal surface ` by chance ' , but they fail to accumulate there ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Second , the feeding experiment with L-fucose ( energy source , but no chemoattractant ; Fig. 4B ) created high nutrient levels throughout the gut lumen . 
According to the ` growth only ' hypothesis , this should have alleviated the accumulation of pFliC-GFP + bacteria at the mucosal surface . 
However , it did not . 
We concluded that chemotaxis was necessary and that the ` growth only ' hypothesis was insufficient for explaining our results . 
However , we could not exclude that enhanced growth at the mucosal surface also contributes to some extent . 
Sequence of events: normal , inﬂamed intestine: a vicious circle
Upon oral infection , the disease develops in several consecutive steps ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Initially , S. Typhimurium faces a non-inﬂamed intestine . 
At this stage , high-energy nutrients , i.e. galactose , are scarce in the cecal lumen and only a very limited reservoir is available within the thin mucus layer covering the epithelium . 
Even though chemotaxis allows S. Typhimurium to access this source of nutrients , this does not seem to enhance growth rates signiﬁcantly if the pathogen fails to trigger inﬂammation ( Stecher et al. , 2007 ) . 
Presumably , the total amount of high-energy nutrients available at the normal mucosal surface is simply too small . 
Mutants incapable of triggering intestinal inﬂammation get ` stuck ' at this stage of the infection . 
In contrast , wild-type bacteria initiate a second phase of the acute infection by engaging the mucosa itself which triggers acute colitis . 
The resulting host defence includes massive mucus secretion . 
Enhanced mucus secretion fosters a robust infection via the following positive feedback loop : increased mucus production provides more high-energy nutrients ; these nutrients are accessed via chemotaxis and allow further growth of the pathogen ; high densities of virulent S. Typhimurium reaching the mucosal surface trigger sustained intestinal inﬂammation ; this keeps up massive mucus secretion . 
This positive feedback loop allows massive intestinal colonization by S. Typhimurium ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
Data obtained from bovine infection models ( Bispham et al. , 2001 ; Coombes et al. , 2005 ) suggest that this may also apply to enteric Salmonella infections in other animal species and in humans . 
In normal , healthy humans , S. Typhimurium infection generally causes self-limiting enterocolitis ( equivalent to stage 2 ; Fig. 5 ) and immune responses clear the infection within less than a week . 
Flagellin and innate immunity
Selection pressures for/against ﬂagellar expression differ signiﬁcantly between various niches within the same infected host . 
Within host tissues , the receptors of the innate immune system recognize pathogen associated ` molecular patterns ' ( PAMPs ) . 
PAMPs are evolutionarily conserved structures important for microbial ﬁtness but are absent in the host . 
Flagellin , the structural building block of the ﬂagella , is recognized by a speciﬁc Toll-like receptor ( TLR5 ; Smith et al. , 2003 ; Andersen-Nissen et al. , 2005 ) and possibly also by additional intracellular pattern recognition molecules ( Nod/Naip/Nalp ; Delbridge and O'Riordan , 2006 ) . 
In principle , the ﬂagellin-triggered defences should select against ﬂagellated strains within host tissues . 
Indeed , S. Typhimurium can replicate more efficiently within the internal organs of MyD88 - / - animals which have a severely reduced innate immune response to most TLR ligands ( Weiss et al. , 2004 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ; Takeda and Akira , 2005 ; Fig . 
S2B and E ; B. Stecher and W.-D . 
Hardt , unpubl . 
obs . ) . 
However , ﬂagellin is poorly expressed at systemic sites ( Cummings et al. , 2006 ) and other PAMPs ( i.e. LPS ) are more potent elicitors of systemic innate immune defences than ﬂagellin . 
This is corroborated by the equivalent competitive ﬁtness of M583 ( no ﬂagella at all ; Fig S2D ) and M944 ( no chemotaxis ; normal ﬂagellin expression in vitro ( Fig . 
S2A ; Stecher et al. , 2004 ) ; detectable ﬂagellin expression in 10 % of the gut luminal bacteria ) at systemic sites of MyD88 - / - and C57BL/6 wild-type mice . 
Similarly , recent studies on TLR5 - / - and TLR4 - / - TLR5 - / - knockout mice revealed that the LPS -- TLR4 interaction dominates the innate defences against Gram-negative pathogens while ﬂagellin-binding to TLR5 contributes little ( Feuillet et al. , 2006 ) . 
Nonetheless , ﬂagella-speciﬁc defences can reduce pathogen ﬁtness within host tissues and should lead to the accumulation of mutations within ﬂagellar genes in the long term . 
On the other hand side , the localized nutrient availability within the inﬂamed intestine enhanced the ﬁtness of virulent , chemotactic S. Typhimurium strains . 
Thus , the conditions in the inﬂamed gut represent a rectifying selective pressure eliminating functional mutations in the ﬂagellar apparatus and the chemotaxis signalling systems . 
This is in line with the observation that the vast majority of human S. Typhimurium isolates from enteric and systemic infections express ﬂagella ( Table S1 ) . 
In conclusion , the ﬁtness beneﬁts from ` motility functions ' of ﬂagella , namely access to nutrients and the epithelial surface , seem to have a greater impact in the acute S. Typhimurium infection cycle , than possible ﬁtness costs attributable to ﬂagella-speciﬁc innate immune defences . 
Fig. 5 . 
` Positive feedback model ' explaining the function of ﬂagella during S. Typhimurium colits . 
Stage 1 . 
Virulent S. Typhimurium reaches the mucosal surface of the murine large intestine by chemotactic movement along sugar gradients . 
At this stage , glycoconjugates are conﬁned to a thin layer lining the epithelial border . 
Stage 2 . 
The resulting host defence induced via Salmonella virulence factors ( i.e. TTSS-1 and TTSS-2 ) includes massive mucus secretion . 
Enhanced mucus secretion fosters a robust infection via the following positive feedback loop : increased mucus production provides more high-energy nutrients ; these nutrients are accessed via chemotaxis and allow further growth of the pathogen ; high densities of virulent S. Typhimurium reaching the mucosal surface trigger sustained intestinal inﬂammation ; this keeps up massive mucus secretion . 
Conclusions
In this work we identiﬁed a key role of motility and nutrient access in enteric salmonellosis . 
Conceptually , ` stimulation ' of nutrient release represents one important mechanism explaining how pathogens can use virulence factors to sabotage defensive responses of the host for their own beneﬁt . 
Other mechanisms may also contribute and represent an important subject for future research . 
The eminent role of motility might offer a basis for novel anti-infective strategies : Chemotaxis inhibitors or nonmetabolizable nutrient analogues binding to chemotaxis receptors may allow preventing the onset of inﬂammation or breaking the feed-forward loop fuelling S. Typhimurium growth during the acute infection . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and plasmids
Bacterial strains and plasmids were generated using standard techniques and are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . 
M963 , the DcheY in-frame mutant , was generated using the Red-recombinase technique ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
Brieﬂy , PCR primers were designed bearing homology to the 5 ′ and 3 ′ boarders of the cheY coding region and the chloramphenicol-resistant cassette on pKD3 ( cheY-rev-ko : 5 ′ - gcct tcatcagcag gcttgataga tggttgcatc atcatcgcatcc tgt gta ggc tgg agc tgc ttc-3 ′ and cheY-fwd-ko : 5 ′ - cagtg ccggacaggc gatacgtatt tgaaccagga gtagtatttt ata tga ata tcc tcc tta gtt-3 ′ ) . 
PCR products were transformed into S. Typhimurium SL1344 wildtype ( SB300 ) and transformants were selected with chloramphenicol ( M957 ) . 
Insertions into the cheY coding region were conﬁrmed by PCR using external primers . 
The mutation was transducted via P22 transduction into the invG sseD : : aphT strain background yielding M958 . 
The chloramphenicol resistance cassette was removed using via ﬂp recombinase on pCP20 yielding strains M962 ( cheY ) and M963 ( cheY invG sseD : : aphT ) . 
Correct excision of the gene was conﬁrmed by PCR . 
The strains were further marked by insertion of a tetracycline resistance [ BCB4 ( Hensel et al. , 1999 ) ] by P22 transduction yielding strains M964 and M965 respectively ( see Table 1 ) . 
pM1419 , a variant of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pHSG422 ( Benjamin et al. , 1990 ) was constructed by removal of the chloramphenicol ( cat ) and kanamycin ( aphT ) - resistant cassettes by digestion , blunting of the site and relegation . 
Reporter plasmids pMGLB and pFLIC were generated in the context of a promoter trap library in pM968 ( carrying promoterless gfpmut2 gene ; B. Stecher and W.-D . 
Hardt , unpubl . ) . 
The regions ( > 300 bp ) upstream of gfpmut2 were sequenced using an internal gfpmut2 sequencing primer and assigned to promoter regions of mglBACD and ﬂiC operons according to the S. Typhi-murium LT2 genome sequence ( Accession No . 
NC_003197 ) .

Speciﬁcally , upstream of the gfpmut2 , pFLIC contained the sequence corresponding to position 2,049146 -- 2,049433 in the LT2 genome ( ﬂiC coding sequence : complement 2,047659 -- 2,049145 ) , pMGLB contained the sequence corresponding to position 2,287415 -- 2,287872 ( mglB coding sequence : complement 2,286618 -- 2,287616 ) . 
We determined that the stability of all vectors derived from pM968 , including pMGLB used in this study is over 95 % at day 1 p.i. 
Recovery of S. Typhimurium from cecal contents for ﬂow cytometry
Mice were dissected cecal contents ( 100 -- 200 mg per mouse ) were suspended in ice-cold PBS and kept at 4 °C throughout the following procedure . 
Contents were ﬁltered through sterile 40 mm cell sieves ( Milian ) and loaded onto a discontinuous percoll/PBS gradient ( 100 -- 80 -- 60 -- 40 % percoll ; centrifugation at 15 000 g , 4 °C for 30 min ) . 
The fraction containing S. Typhimurium ( border between 80 % and 100 % percoll ) was recovered . 
Bacteria were washed with PBS and an appropriate dilution was used for FACS analysis . 
For speciﬁc FACS of S. Typhimurium , samples were stained with Fab fragments prepared from a-Salmonella O antigen group B serum ( factors 1 , 4 , 5 and 12 ; Difco ) by papain digest ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
Allophycocyanin ( APC ) - labelled-goat-a-rabbit-Fab Fab fragments ( Invitrogen ) were used as secondary antibodies . 
Animals
Speciﬁed pathogen-free ( SPF ) C57BL/6 mice ( 6 -- 10 weeks old ) were from Harlan ( Horst , Netherlands ) or Janvier ( Le Genest Saint Isle ) . 
MyD88 - / - mice ( Adachi et al. , 1998 ) ( 6 -- 10 weeks old ) on C57BL/6 background were maintained at the BZL Zurich under barrier conditions . 
Infection experiments in the streptomycin-pretreated mouse model were approved by the Swiss authorities and carried out as described previously ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , mice were pretreated by gavage with 20 mg of streptomycin . 
Twentyfour hours later the mice were intragastrically inoculated with single strains or strain mixtures , as indicated . 
In co-infection experiments , the strain ration of the inoculum was determined by plating . 
Infections were performed for 18 h ( day 1 p.i. ) , 42 h ( day 2 p.i. ) , 66 h ( day 3 p.i. ) or 90 h ( day 4 p.i. ) if not stated otherwise . 
Analysis of S. Typhimurium loads in cecal content, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver
Mesenteric lymph nodes , spleen and liver were removed aseptically and homogenized in cold PBS ( 0.5 % tergitol , 0.5 % BSA ) . 
Cecum content was suspended in 500 ml cold PBS . 
The bacterial loads were determined by plating on MacConkey agar plates ( 50 mg ml-1 streptomycin ) as described recently ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Total colonization levels of mutant ( carrying an appropriate antibiotic marker ) and wild-type bacteria were determined by plating ( 50 mg ml-1 streptomycin ) and the mutant/wildtype ratio was deﬁned by replica-plating on media containing tetracycline ( 12.5 mg ml-1 ) . 
Competitive indices were calculated according to the formula CI = ratiooutput/ratioinput . 
Determination of the replicative index
pHSG422 and pM1419 were used to compare replication rates between two different S. Typhimurium strains . 
Streptomycinpretreated mice were co-infected i.g. with 1:1 mixtures 7 - - R R ( 5 ¥ 10 cfu in total ) of T1 T2 amp ( M984 ; amp ; kanR ; LacZ + ) - - - R R R and T1 T2 Fla ( M933 ; tet ; kan ) . 
Both strains carried the cm temperature-sensitive plasmid pHSG422 at the time of infection ( > 99 % ) . 
If indicated , colitis was induced ` in trans ' by co-infecting with 15 ¥ 107 cfu wild type ( SB300 ; kanS. ) . 
Loss of pHSG422 at 24 -- 26 h after infection was determined by plating on MacConkey agar harbouring four different combinations of antibiotics : ( i ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin ( all M984 ) , ( ii ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 125 mg ml-1 tetracycline ( all M933 ) , ( iii ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin + 50 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol ( M984 harbouring pHSG422 ) , and ( iv ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 125 mg ml-1 tetracycline + 50 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol ( M933 harbouring pHSG422 ) . 
Furthermore , T1-T2-ampR ( lacZ + ) was distinguished from T1-T2-Fla - ( lacZ - ) via the bright red colour of the lacZ + colonies . 
The presence of the lacZ gene did not alter bacterial growth rate in the intestine during inﬂammation as tested via competitive infection of T1-T2-ampR ( ampR ; kanR ; LacZ + ) with a tetR variant of T1-T2 - ( M951 ; tetR ; kanR ; data not shown ) . 
The replicative index is deﬁned as the ratio of # [ pHSG422 + M933 ] / [ #total M933 ] and # [ pHSG422 + M984 ] / #total [ M984 ] . 
When pM1419 was used , loss of pM1419 at 24 -- 26 h after infection was determined by plating on MacConkey agar harbouring four different combinations of anti-biotics : ( i ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 30 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol ( all M318 ) , ( ii ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 125 mg ml-1 tetracycline ( all M965 ) , ( iii ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 30 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol ( all M318 haboring pM1419 ) , and ( iv ) 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin + 125 mg ml-1 tetracycline ( all M965 harbouring pM1419 ) . 
The replicative index is deﬁned as the ratio of # [ pM1419 + M965 ] / [ #total M965 ] and # [ pM1419 + M318 ] / #total [ M318 ] . 
Histopathological evaluation
If not otherwise stated , tissues were embedded in OCT ( Sakura , Torrance , CA ) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen . 
Cryosections ( 5 mm ; cross-sectional ) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) . 
Cecum pathology was evaluated by a pathologist in a blinded manner using a histopathological scoring scheme as previously described ( Stecher et al. , 2004 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
For detecting GFP expression ( pFLIC or pMGLB ) in situ , cecal tissues were recovered and treated as described recently ( Stecher et al. , 2004 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the tissues were ﬁxed in paraform-aldehyde ( 4 % in PBS , pH 7.4 overnight , 4 °C ) , washed with PBS , equilibrated in PBS ( 20 % sucrose , 0.1 % NaN3 overnight , 4 °C ) , embedded in OCT ( Sakura , Torrance , CA ) , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C . 
Cryosections ( 7 mm ) were air-dried for 2 h at room temperature , ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( 5 min ) , washed and blocked in 10 % ( w/v ) normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h . 
The sections were immunostained for 1 h with a polyclonal rabbit a-Salmonella O antigen group B serum [ factors 1 , 4 , 5 and 12 , Difco ; 1:500 in PBS , 10 % ( w/v ) goat serum ] . 
Non-O-glycosylated Muc2-precursors were detected with a polyclonal rabbit a-Muc2 gpda PH497 ( 1:100 ; kind gift of Professor Gunnar Hansson ) . 
We used FITC - , Cy5 - or Cy3-conjugated secondary goat a-rabbit antibodies [ Milan ; 1:300 in PBS , 10 % ( w/v ) goat serum ] as indicated . 
DNA was stained with DAPI ( 4 ′ 6 ′ - diamidino-2-phenylindole , 0.5 mg ml-1 ; Sigma ) . 
F-Actin was visualized by staining with Alexa-647-conjugated phalloidin , as indicated ( Molecular Probes ) . 
Glyco-conjugates were stained with the labelled lectins UEA-1-rhodamine ( 1:100 ; Reactolab ) or CGL-2-ﬂuoresceine ( 1:100 ; Walser et al. , 2005 ) . 
Sections were mounted with Vectashield hard set ( Vector laboratories ) and sealed with nail polish . 
The spatial distribution of GFP + and GFP - bacteria in the cecal lumen was determined by imaging series of adjacent optical ﬁelds ( 200 ¥ 200 mm ) using a Perkin Elmer Ultraview confocal imaging system and a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope . 
Red , green and cyan ﬂuorescence was recorded confocally while DAPI ﬂuorescence was imaged by epiﬂuorescence microscopy . 
Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0.1 . 
The fraction of GFP-expressing bacteria was determined by enumerating the total number of Salmonella ( red a-LPS stain ) and the number of GFP + Salmonella ( GFP ﬂuorescence and red a-LPS stain ) in each optical ﬁeld counting at least 150 originating from three different areas of equivalent distance to the epithelium . 
The fraction of bacteria expressing the reporter was calculated as : GFP + red + [ % ] = #GFP + red + / ( #red + ) ¥ 100 . 
For measuring ﬂuorescence intensity of GFP expressing S. Typhimurium , image stacks were acquired using a confocal system ( Zeiss/Perkin Elmer ) and Plan Neoﬂuar ¥ 63 oil objective . 
Fluorescence intensity was measured and corrected for background ﬂuorescence using Ultraview imaging software ( Perkin Elmer ) . 
Time lapse microscopy
For time lapse microscopy , infected mice were killed and cecal contents were quickly removed and re-suspended in 5 volumes ( 100 mg = 100 ml ) HBSS containing 10 % BSA and 30 ug ml-1 chloramphenicol . 
Contents were mounted onto a heated specimen holder ( 37 °C ) on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m inverted microscope . 
Time series of GFP-ﬂuorescence signals were recorded with an Ultraview confocal head ( PerkinElmer ) , a krypton argon laser ( 643-RYB-A01 , Melles Griot , Didam , Netherlands ) and a Plan Neoﬂuar 20 ¥ objective ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) at 6 frames/s . 
Motile GFP-expressing bacteria in the run phase were manually tracked using Volocity 4 software ( Improvision , UK ) .

Isolated S. Typhimurium strains were subject to purity control by growth on appropriate Salmonella-selective media ( Endo agar , Oxoid ) . 
Morphological examination was followed by serological identiﬁcation of S. Typhimurium speciﬁc O-antigen ( 4 , [ 5 ] ) . 
Rough forms were excluded by the trypaﬂavine test ( Pampana , 1933 ) . 
H-antigenic phase was examined by agglutination using H1 and H1 ,2 antiserum ( SIFIN ) . 
To detect the second H phase , phase inversion was selected by growth on Sven Gard agar swarm plates ( 20 % proteose peptone , 1 % glucose , 3 % yeast extract , 3 % meat extract , 8 % agar , 5 g l-1 NaCl , 2 g l-1 Na2HPO4 ¥ 2 H2O , pH 7.3 -- 7.4 ) containing respective H-antiserum ( corresponding to the phase already determined , i.e. Hi or H1 ,2 ) . 
S. Typhimurium was allowed to swarm at 37 °C . 
After formation of a swarming zone , material was used from the outer region of the zone and subject to agglutination using the second H-speciﬁc antiserum . 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the exact Mann -- Whitney U-test and the SPSS Version 14.0 software , as described before ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
Values of P < 0.05 were considered as statistically signiﬁcant . 
Box plots were created using GraphPad Prism 4 version 4.03 .
