Abstract 
Braun/murein lipoprotein ( Lpp ) is one of the major outer membrane components of gram-negative enteric bacteria involved in inflammatory responses and septic shock . 
In previous studies , we reported that two copies of the lipoprotein ( lpp ) gene ( designated as lppA and lppB ) existed on the chromosome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Deletion of both lppA and lppB genes rendered Salmonella defective in invasion , motility , induction of cytotoxicity , and production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines . 
The lppAB double-knockout ( DKO ) mutant was attenuated in mice , and animals immunized with this mutant were protected against subsequent challenge with lethal doses of wild-type ( wt ) S. Typhimurium . 
To better understand how deletion of the lpp gene might affect Salmonella virulence , we performed global transcriptional profiling of the genes in the wt and the lppAB DKO mutant of S. Typhimurium using microarrays . 
Our data revealed alterations in the expression of flagellar genes , invasion-associated type III secretion system genes , and transcriptional virulence gene regulators in the lppAB DKO mutant compared to wt S. Typhimurium . 
These data correlated with the lppAB DKO mutant phenotype and provided possible mechanism ( s ) of Lpp-associated attenuation in S. Typhimurium . 
Although these studies were performed in in vitro grown bacteria , our future research will be targeted at global transcriptional profiling of the genes in in vivo grown wt S. Typhimurium and its Lpp mutant .

Introduction 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an invasive bacterium that causes gastroenteritis and septicemia due to the consumption of contaminated food ( Mishu et al. , 1994 ) . 
S. Typhimurium colonizes intestinal mucosa , with fecal shedding of the organisms providing a source of infection for other animals and humans ( Barrow et al. , 1988 ; Wallis and Galyov , 2000 ) . 
Subsequent to colonization , salmonellae transcytose M cells and intestinal epithelial cells and are phagocytized by resident macrophages , where they multiply and further invade internal organs , such as the liver and spleen ( Collins and Carter ,

S. Typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells is mediated by translocation of pathogenicity island-1 ( SPI-1 ) effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells ( Hayward et al. , 2002 ) . 
The effector proteins activate signal transduction pathways that lead to actin polymerization and cell membrane ruffling , resulting in the uptake of bacteria in membrane-bound vesicles ( Finlay et al. , 1991 ; Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay , 1994 ; Zhou and Galan , 2001 ; Cardenas et al. , 2004 ) . 
One of the most serious complications of S. Typhimurium infection is septic shock , which is mediated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Morrison and Ryan , 1987 ; Glauser et al. , 1991 ) . 
Recently , we reported that Braun/murein lipoprotein ( Lpp ) , one of the most abundant components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae ( Braun and Hantke , 1974 ) , contributed significantly to septic shock development by inducing production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) and interleukin ( IL ) -6 in primary macrophage and in LPS non-responsive mice ( Zhang et al. , 1997 ) . 
Further , purified Lpp from Escherichia coli synergized with LPS to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to septic shock , indicating that Lpp and LPS activate cells by binding to different receptors ( Fenton and Golenbock , 1998 ) . 
Indeed , further studies indicated that LPS activates cellular responses by binding to the CD14 receptors and via toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -4 ( Lee et al. , 1995 ; Fenton and Golenbock , 1998 ; Tobias et al. , 1999 ) , while Lpp binds to TLR-2 to activate host cells ( Aliprantis et al. , 1999 ) . 
We previously demonstrated the presence of two functional copies of the lpp gene ( lppA and lppB ) on the chromosome of S. Typhimurium 14028 ( Sha et al. , 2004 ) , which were located in tandem and separated by 82 bp ( Sha et al. , 2004 ) . 
Deletion of both copies of the lpp gene resulted in a Salmonella mutant that minimally invaded epithelial cells and was non-motile and severely impaired in its ability to induce cytotoxicity in murine macrophages ( RAW 264.7 ) and T84 human colonic epithelial cells ( Sha et al. , 2004 ) . 
The lppAB double-knockout ( DKO ) mutant was avirulent in mice when infected by the oral and intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) routes , and mice immunized with the mutant were protected from death when challenged with lethal doses of wild-type ( wt ) S. Typhimurium ( Sha et al. , 2004 ; Fadl et al. , 2005 ) . 
In this report , we investigated global effects of Lpp on alteration of Salmonella virulence associated genes by performing microarrays analysis . 
Our data indicated alterations in the expression of genes encoding flagella , type III secretion system ( TTSS ) - associated invasion proteins , stress-related proteins , and transcriptional regulators in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to its parental wt S. Typhimurium strain . 
These studies provided , for the first time , a molecular basis of how deletion of Lpp might reduce S. Typhimurium virulence and associated host responses . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Microarray gene expression profiling
Wt S. Typhimurium 14028 ( Amrican Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Manassas , VA ) and its lppAB DKO mutant ( Sha et al. , 2004 ) were grown in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) medium and incubated with aeration ( 150 rpm ) until O.D600 nm reached to 0.6 . 
Bacterial RNA was isolated using RiboPure-Bacteria RNA isolation kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Labeled cDNA was prepared from RNA and applied to S. Typhimurium LT2 genome microarrays , which were developed by the Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR , Rockville , MD ) and provided by the Pathogen Functional Genome Resource Center ( PFGRC ) of the National Institutes of Health . 
The genome microarrays consisted of polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products representing segments of 5405 open reading frames ( ORFs ) from strain LT2 . 
Preparation of fluorescence probes , hybridization , initial data processing , and normalization were performed at the Genomic Core Facility , UTMB , Galveston , TX . 
The microarray analysis was conducted in duplicate , and three independent experiments were performed to generate reproducible and statistically significant data . 
The data were analyzed by 4 different techniques : GenePix Pro 6.0 ( Molecular Devices Corporation , Union City , CA ) , Significance Analysis of Microarray ( SAM , University of California , Berkley , CA ) , Spotfire DecisionSite 7.3 ( Spotfire , Somerville , MA ) , and Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) . 
Only genes that exhibited 2-fold changes in gene expression or higher ( p ≤ 0.05 ) for each of the statistical methods employed were considered significant . 
We also assessed patterns of gene expression alterations between the lppAB DKO mutant and wt S. Typhimurium by hierarchical clustering using Spotfire and CLUSFAVOR 6.0 ( Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX ) software . 
These analysis techniques are routinely used in our laboratory ( Galindo et al. , 2003 , 2004 ) . 
2.2. Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR
The real-time RT-PCR was performed in the LightCycler system ( Roche Biochemical , Indianapolis , IN ) using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) as we previously described ( Galindo et al. , 2003 ) . 
Briefly , 200 ng of RNA was added into a 20 μl reaction volume containing 1 μg of each primer , 10 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix , and 0.2 μl of reverse transcriptase . 
The RT-PCR reaction was performed at 55 °C for 20 min followed by a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min and 40 PCR cycles with 95 °C denaturation for 15 s , 55 °C annealing for 20 s , and 72 °C extension for 20 s. To confirm PCR specificity , the PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis . 
Experiments were run in parallel and the fold-change values were calculated after normalization of each gene to an internal control 16S rRNA , using the comparative threshold method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . 
Primers used in the amplification of these genes are listed in Table 1 . 
2.3. Electron microscopy
Bacteria were grown in LB medium overnight under static conditions , pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline . 
Bacterial suspensions were place

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microarray analysis
The lppAB DKO mutant of S. Typhimurium was highly attenuated when tested in both in vitro and in vivo models of Salmonella infections ( Sha et al. , 2004 ; Fadl et al. , 2005 ) . 
Therefore , we compared the global patterns of gene expression of wt S. Typhimurium and its lppAB DKO mutant using microarrays to better understand how deletion of Lpp might affect Salmonella virulence . 
Based on microarray analysis results , there were 29 genes whose expression was significantly altered ( 27 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated ) in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to that of wt S. Typhimurium ( Table 2 ) . 
These genes included those that code for invasion-associated type III effector proteins ( sipB and sipC ) , and those encoded by Salmonella SPI-1 ( e.g. , regulatory invF and hilD genes ) . 
Similar reductions were observed in the transcriptional levels of other invasion-relate

Total RNA isolated from wt S. Typhimurium and lppAB DKO mutant was used for RT-PCR .

These numbers represent down-regulation of genes in the lppAB DKO mutant compared to wt S. Typhimurrium . 
genes , including pipC , a homolog of Shigella ipgE gene , and orgA , an oxygen-regulated invasion gene . 
The down-regulation of type III invasion-associated genes correlated with the phenotype of the lppAB DKO mutant ( i.e. , defects in invasion and cell death ) compared to wt S. Typhimurium ( Sha et al. , 2004 ; Fadl et al. , 2005 ) . 
Both SipB and SipC are required for bacterial entry into host epithelial cells and translocation of other effectors into eukaryotic cells . 
SipC plays an important role in bacterial-induced host cell cytoskeletal rearrangement , and therefore facilitates bacterial entry into host cells ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
On the other hand , SipB was shown to induce apoptosis by binding to caspase-1 and triggering a signaling cascade ( Hersh et al. , 1999 ) . 
Therefore , reduced cytotoxicity and the inability to induce cell death , associated with the lppAB DKO mutant , could be due to down-regulation of SipB . 
Our microarray data , which were confirmed by real-time RTPCR , indicated down-regulation of several motility-associated genes in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to that of WT S. Typhimurium ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . 
Synthesis and function of flagella require expression of more than 50 genes , including structural subunits , regulatory proteins , motor force generators , and chemosensory machinery ( Chilcott and Hughes , 2000 ) . 
Flagellar genes can be categorized into three classes , based on their transcriptional hierarchy . 
Those that belong to class 1 , such as flhC , flhD , and flgM , are early regulatory genes that respond to environmental stimuli and transcriptionally activate class 2 genes . 
Class 2 genes include structural components of the hook -- basal-body ( HBB ) and the fliA regulatory gene , which encodes the flagellar specific alternative sigma factor σ28 that is necessary for the activation of class 3 genes . 
Class 3 genes encode proteins involved in the final stages of flagellar assembly , including flagellar motor force generators , flagellin subunit proteins ( fliC and fliB ) , and proteins involved in the chemotactic signal transduction pathway ( Hughes and Mathee , 1998 ) . 
Flagellar synthesis genes were down-regulated in the lppAB DKO mutant compared to that of the wt bacterium : the flagellar filament capping gene fliD ( − 11-fold ) , flagellin fliC ( − 50-fold ) , hook -- filament junction flgL ( − 49-fold ) , anti-sigma factor flgM ( − 9-fold ) , and a chemotactic sensory histidine protein kinase ( cheA , − 12-fold ) . 
Interestingly , the flagellar motor generator gene , motA , was also down-regulated ( − 14-fold ) , suggesting a possible explanation for non-motility of the lppAB DKO mutant . 
To test whether this impairment in motility resulted from changes in flagella production , we performed transmission electron microscopy . 
The electron micrograph ( Fig. 1 ) indicated no change in the number of flagella per cell in the lppAB DKO mutant compared to that of wt S. Typhimurium , suggesting that a mutation in Lpp may affect the composition rather than the flagellar number . 
Based on our microarray analysis results , it is apparent that genes involved in flagellar synthesis and regulation were affected by Lpp deletion . 
Although the fliC gene expression was downregulated in the lpp mutant , the level of FliC at the protein level might be enough to preserve the integrity of the flagella , while down-regulation of the motA gene would result in not having enough protein to generate torque in the flagella for bacteria to exhibit motility . 
Our future studies will be focused on performing proteomics analysis on the bacterial extracts of wt versus the Lpp mutant to correlate genomics and proteomics data .

Hierarchical cluster analysis of S. Typhimurium genes in the wt versus lppAB DKO mutant , performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 7.3 and CLUSFAVOR 6.0 software programs . 
Clustering was performed on signal values from all six experiments , which are represented by six columns ( 3 wt and 3 lppAB DKO mutants ) . 
A. Spotfire DecisionSite cluster : the lppAB DKO mutant ( Lpm ) shows a pattern of down-regulated genes ( green ) , compared to the wt S. Typhimurium . 
Very high signal values are shown in red , low signal values are in green , and median signal values are represented as black . 
B. List of genes that were common to both clusters ( generated using Spotfire and CLUSFAVOR [ not shown ] ) and that were also considered to be significantly altered based on 4 separate analysis techniques ( Table 2 ) . 
Significant reductions in expression levels were also observed for yqhC , an AraC/xylS family of transcriptional regulator ; stress-related dnaK , which encodes heat-shock protein Hsp70 ; cpxP , a periplasmic repressor of Cpx regulon ; and phoH , a PhoB-dependent , ATP-binding Pho regulon ( Table 2 ) . 
YqhC is involved in activation of virulence and stress-related genes , while Cpx is a two-component system regulator that has been implicated in pathogenicity and stress adaptation ( Raivio and Silhavy , 1999 ; Hung et al. , 2001 ) and in activating genes coding for stress-related proteins , including dnaK . 
The DnaK , DnaE and DnaJ chaperone machinery system was shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella , as well as in DNA replication , protein transport , and auto-regulation of heat-shock responses ( Hendrick and Hartl , 1993 ; Gamer et al. , 1996 ) . 
A Salmonella strain with a mutation in the dnaK -- dnaJ operon resulted in temperature-sensitivity , loss in lethality during systemic infection in mice , and the inability to survive and replicate inside macrophages ( Buchmeier and Heffron , 1990 ; Takaya et al. , 2004 ) . 
Further , the dnaK -- dnaJ mutant was defective in secretion of invasion-associated proteins encoded by SPI-1 , and hence could not invade 407 intestinal epithelial cells ( Buchmeier and Heffron , 1990 ; Takaya et al. , 2004 ) . 
Given the involvement of these genes in stress-related responses , their down-regulation could have contributed to the attenuation of the lpp DKO mutant . 
OrgA and PipC , which were similarly down-regulated in the lppAB DKO mutant compared to the wt bacterium , based on microarray analysis results ( Table 2 ) , have also been associated with virulence and enteropathogenicity of Salmonella ( Jones and Falkow , 1994 ; Mavris et al. , 2002 ) . 
OrgA is an oxygenregulated protein encoded by SPI-1 that was shown to be essential for invasion and virulence of Salmonella . 
A Salmonella orgA mutant was as virulent as the wt bacterium when inoculated via the i.p. route ; however , it was significantly attenuated ( 60-fold ) in its ability to cause disease by an oral route of infection ( Jones and Falkow , 1994 ) . 
On the other hand , the SPI-5-encoded pipC gene ( homolog of Shigella ipgE ) has been suggested to be involved in the enteropathogenicity of Salmonella ( Mavris et al. , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , down-regulation of these two genes , orgA and pipC , along with other type III-associated genes , might have contributed to the significant reduction in virulence of the lppAB DKO mutant of S. Typhimurium . 
We also observed reduction in expression of genes with unknown functions and those that encode putative proteins , such as YbaJ , YtfK , yodC , and YeeN ( Table 2 ) . 
Their possible role in Salmonella virulence will be investigated in the future . 
Only 2 genes were up-regulated in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to the wt S. Typhimurium : murD ( involved in cell wall formation ) and yodC , a putative cytoplasmic protein ( Table 2 ) . 
We also performed hierarchical clustering in order to assess patterns of gene expression alterations between the lppAB DKO mutant and the wt bacterium ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Hierarchical cluster analysis of genes using Spotfire DecisionSite software revealed a set of genes that were down-regulated in the lppAB DKO mutant ( bright green ) compared to the pattern shown for w

S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Genes with very high expression levels are shown as bright red , and those with median expression levels are black ( Fig. 2A ) . 
A similar clustering pattern was obtained using the CLUSFAVOR software ( data not shown ) . 
The overall gene expression value for this cluster decreased in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to wt S. Typhimurium . 
Genes that consistently clustered together ( i.e. , when either Spotfire or CLUSFAVOR software was used ) and that were also determined to be significantly altered based on the four analysis methods used ( Table 2 ) are listed in Fig. 2B . 
These genes were functionally similar , with the majority involved in flagellar synthesis . 
The nearly identical pattern of expression observed for these genes suggested that the involvement of Lpp in flagellar protein synthesis might be coordinately regulated . 
These results also implied that interruption of flagellar protein synthesis might be a profound event contributing to the other observed alterations in gene expression and decreased virulence of the Lpp mutant . 
In order to verify the microarray data , real-time RT-PCR was performed on selected genes , which were chosen based on their involvement in Salmonella motility and invasion ( which were impaired in the lppAB DKO mutant ) or transcriptional regulation of the virulence genes . 
The real-time RT-PCR data ( Table 3 ) indicated down-regulation of fliC , fliD , flgM , invF , prgH , and yqhC genes in the mutant , compared to the wt bacterium , confirming the microarray results ( Table 2 ) . 
4. Conclusion
Data from microarray analysis , confirmed by real-time RTPCR , indicated a significant alteration in the expression of Salmonella virulence genes in the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to the wt bacterium . 
Most notable was the downregulation of invasion-associated genes encoded by Salmonella SPI-1 , flagellar genes , and genes encoding virulence gene regulators . 
Our microarray data correlated with our previously published studies , which demonstrated defects in invasion and motility of the lppAB DKO mutant , compared to that of wt S. Typhimurium . 
Further , global profiling of the genes in the wt versus Lpp mutant provided potential new genes that could be targeted to fully understand the role of Lpp in modulating Salmonella virulence . 
In the future , we plan to perform detailed proteomics analyses , which will complement our genomics data and allow us to determine the effects of Lpp at the translational level . 
In addition , we will perform similar studies from in vivo-grown bacteria to corroborate data obtained from in vitro-grown wt S. Typhimurium and its Lpp mutant . 
Taken together , the global alteration of genes by Lpp provided new information on how deletion of Lpp might attenuate this S. Typhimurium mutant .
