Introduction 
Two major forms of iron are found on our planet : Fe ( II ) in reducing intracellular environments , and Fe ( III ) in aerobic atmosphere . 
While iron is essential for several biological processes , Fe ( II ) overload leads to cellular malfunctions as a result of oxygen-dependent iron-stimulated free radical reactions ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 1992 ; Touati , 2000 ) . 
Thus , organisms control the Fe ( II ) concentration in the various cellular compartments by tightly regulating uptake , storage and secretion ( Nelson , 1999 ) . 
Although once considered non-cytotoxic ( Braun , 1997 ; Bruins et al. , 2000 ) , Fe ( III ) has bactericidal activity and this activity is different from that promoted by Fe ( II ) as Fe ( III ) exerts its bactericidal effect in an oxygen-independent fashion ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) . 
The PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system is activated speciﬁcally by extracytoplasmic Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) and is required for resistance to Fe ( III ) in several enteric species ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) . 
The PmrA/PmrB system governs the expression of proteins that confer resistance to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B by modifying the lipid A phosphates in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) with 4-aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine ( Groisman et al. , 1997 ; Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
The connection that exists between resistance to polymyxin B and to Fe ( III ) , however , is pres-ently unclear . 
Although a non-cytotoxic form of polymyxin B -- termed polymyxin B nonapeptide ( Vaara and Vaara , 1983 ) -- could partially protect a Salmonella pmrA mutant from Fe ( III ) - mediated killing ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) inactivation of the PmrA-activated loci responsible for the lipid A modiﬁcation with 4-aminoarabinose ( i.e. pbgP ) or phosphoethanolamine ( i.e. pmrC ) did not render the organism susceptible to Fe ( III ) ( Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
The PmrA-activated pbgPE operon [ also referred to as arn ( Breazeale et al. , 2003 ) and pmrF ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ) ] consists of seven genes . 
The ﬁrst ﬁve genes encode proteins that participate in the biosynthesis and incorporation of 4-aminoarabinose into lipid A ( Raetz and Whitﬁeld , 2002 ) , but are not required for resistance to Fe ( III ) ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) . 
On the other hand , strains with in-frame deletions in either of the last two genes of the pbgPE operon ( designated pbgE2 and pbgE3 ) could 
Summary 
Iron is an essential metal but can be toxic in excess . 
While several homeostatic mechanisms prevent oxygen-dependent killing promoted by Fe ( II ) , little is known about how cells cope with Fe ( III ) , which kills by oxygen-independent means . 
Several Gram-negative bacterial species harbour a regulatory system -- termed PmrA/PmrB -- that is activated by and required for resistance to Fe ( III ) . 
We now report the identiﬁcation of the PmrA-regulated determinants mediating resistance to Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
We establish that these determinants remodel two regions of the lipopolysaccharide , decreasing the negative charge of this major constituent of the outer membrane . 
Remodelling entails the covalent modiﬁcation of the two phosphates in the lipid A region with phosphoethanola-mine and 4-aminoarabinose , which has been previously implicated in resistance to polymyxin B , as well as dephosphorylation of the Hep ( II ) phosphate in the core region by the PmrG protein . 
A mutant lacking the PmrA-regulated Fe ( III ) resistance genes bound more Fe ( III ) than the wild-type strain and was defective for survival in soil , suggesting that these PmrA-regulated lipopolysaccharide modiﬁcations aid Salmonella 's survival and spread in non-host environments .

not grow in the presence of 100 mM Fe ( III ) ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) . 
They differed instead in their resistance to polymyxin B : a pbgE2 mutant was hypersensitive to polymyxin B whereas a pbgE3 mutant was not ( Gunn et al. , 2000 ) . 
The biochemical function of the PbgE2 and PbgE3 proteins remains unknown . 
The PmrA-activated yibD and dgoA genes are dispensable for resistance to polymyxin B and Fe ( III ) ( Tamayo et al. , 2002 ) . 
Here we report the identiﬁcation of the PmrA-regulated cell envelope modiﬁcations mediating resistance to Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) . 
We establish that Fe ( III ) resistance entails both modiﬁcations of the lipid A region of the LPS previously implicated in resistance to polymyxin B as well as dephosphorylation of one of the phosphates in the core region of the LPS by the PmrA-activated PmrG protein . 
We dem-onstrate that these modiﬁcations lower the overall negative charge in the bacterial cell surface , which reduces binding of Fe ( III ) and helps Salmonella survive in soil .

Results
The pbgE2 and pbgE3 genes are not directly involved in Fe ( III ) resistance 
We determined that the minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) for Fe ( III ) of strains deleted for the pbgE2 or pbgE3 genes is 50 mM , which is similar to the MIC of the DpmrAB mutant ( i.e. 100 mM ) and much lower than the MIC of the wild-type strain or mutants defective in either the pbgP or ugd genes ( i.e. 3.2 mM ) ( Table 1 ) . 
Plasmids expressing the pbgE2 or pbgE3 genes from a derivative of the tet promoter restored wild-type levels of resistance to the pbgE2 and pbgE3 mutants respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
Interestingly , wild-type levels of Fe ( III ) resistance could also be restored to the pbgE2 or pbgE3 mutants upon inactivation of the pbgP or ugd genes ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that the pbgE2 and pbgE3 gene products are not directly involved in Fe ( III ) resistance . 
Consistent with this notion , the plasmids expressing the pbgE2 or pbgE3 genes or one that expressed both pbgE2 and pbgE3 from the tet promoter derivative failed to confer Fe ( III ) resistance upon the DpmrAB mutant ( Table 1 ) . 
Thus , the connection between the pbgE2 or pbgE3 genes and Fe ( III ) resistance was not investigated further . 
Identiﬁcation of Fe(III) resistance genes
To uncover the PmrA-regulated genes mediating Fe ( III ) resistance , we prepared a genomic library from the Fe ( III ) - susceptible DpmrAB mutant in the multicopy number plasmid pBR322 ( Bolivar et al. , 1977 ) . 
Plasmid DNA was isolated from a pool of 26 000 transformants , introduced into the same DpmrAB mutant and transformants that could grow on agar plates containing 200 mM Fe ( III ) and 
50 mg ml-1 ampicillin were recovered . 
The rationale behind this strategy was that a PmrA-regulated Fe ( III ) resistance gene ( s ) might be expressed from the tet promoter in pBR322 and phenotypically rescue the DpmrAB mutant . 
Then , we isolated plasmid DNA from each of 52 puriﬁed transformants and used it to retransform the DpmrAB mutant . 
All 52 plasmids conferred Fe ( III ) resistance , indicative that the plasmids harboured Fe ( III ) resistance genes . 
Sequence analysis of the inserts in the 52 plasmid clones revealed that DNA originating from seven different regions of the Salmonella chromosome could confer Fe ( III ) resistance upon the DpmrAB mutant ( Fig . 
S1 ) . 
These inserts encompassed a total of 16 open reading frames ( ORFs ) , which were individually subcloned into pBR322 . 
Eight of the resulting subclones could still confer Fe ( III ) resistance upon the DpmrAB mutant but to different degrees ( Fig . 
S2 ) . 
We focused our attention on the pmrC and pmrG genes because they bestowed the highest levels of Fe ( III ) resistance upon the DpmrAB mutant ( Fig . 
S2 ) , and because they were known to be directly regulated by the PmrA protein ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ) ; this is in contrast to the six other genes , whose expression was not PmrA-dependent ( data not shown ) .

The PmrA-activated ugd , pbgP , pmrC and pmrG genes are required for Fe ( III ) resistance 
To examine whether the pmrG and pmrC genes are necessary for Fe ( III ) resistance , we constructed strains deleted for the chromosomal copies of these genes ( see Experimental procedures ) . 
Both DpmrG and DpmrC single mutants and a DpmrG pmrC double mutant behaved like the wild-type parent ( Table 1 ) . 
We also made double mutants deleted in additional PmrA-regulated genes or operons ( i.e. ugd , yibD , and the pbgPE operon ) . 
These mutants also resembled the wild-type parent in terms of MIC for Fe ( III ) ( Table 1 ) . 
Thus , we constructed strains deleted for multiple PmrA-regulated genes with the hope of creating a strain that recapitulated the Fe ( III ) hypersensitivity of the DpmrAB mutant . 
A strain deleted for the pbgPE operon and the pmrC , ugd , pmrG and yibD genes exhibited the same hypersensitivity to Fe ( III ) as the DpmrAB mutant ( Table 1 ) . 
This was also true for a strain deleted for the pmrC , ugd , pmrG and yibD genes ( Table 1 ) , which is consistent with the fact that the proteins encoded by the ugd gene and pbgP operon participate in the same pathway of synthesis and incorporation of 4-aminoarabinose into lipid A ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ; Breazeale et al. , 2003 ) . 
We investigated all possible combinations of double and triple mutants with deletions in the pmrC , ugd , pmrG and yibD genes and determined that only the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant was as hypersensitive to Fe ( III ) as the DpmrAB mutant ( Table 1 ) . 
Furthermore , a strain deleted for of all three pmrC , ugd and pmrG genes and harbouring the pmrA505 allele , which encodes a PmrA protein that promotes transcription of PmrA-activated genes even under noninducing conditions ( Kox et al. , 2000 ) , was as susceptible to Fe ( III ) as the DpmrAB mutant ( Table 1 ) . 
Collectively , these results strongly suggest that the pmrC , ugd and pmrG genes and the pbgPE operon are the only PmrA-regulated determinants required for Fe ( III ) resistance . 
The Fe(III)-susceptible mutants display increased Fe(III) binding
The LPS is one of the major components and the most accessible surface molecule in the outer leaﬂet of the 
LPS modiﬁcations conferring Fe ( III ) resistance 647 bacterial outer membrane . 
It consists of three structur-ally distinct regions : the outermost O-antigen , a central core , and the innermost lipid A ( Raetz and Whitﬁeld , 2002 ) . 
The pmrC gene product and the proteins encoded in the ugd gene and pbgPE operon mediate the modiﬁcation of the two lipid A phosphates with phosphoethanolamine ( Lee et al. , 2004 ) and 4-aminoarabinose ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ) respectively . 
This suggested that Fe ( III ) resistance may result from hindering electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Fe ( III ) and the negatively charged phosphates in the lipid A ; and it predicted that the Fe ( III ) - susceptible mutants would bind more iron than the wild-type strain . 
Consistent with this notion , there were 3 -- 3.5 times more 59Fe associated with the DpmrAB mutant and the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant than with the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1A ) . 
On the other hand , 59Fe association with the pmrC , ugd and pmrG single mutants was similar to that exhibited by the wild-type parent ( Fig. 1A ) . 
These results demonstrated that those mutants that bind more Fe ( III ) are more readily killed by this metal . 
Polymyxin B nonapeptide rescues the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant from Fe ( III ) - mediated killing 
Modiﬁcation of the lipid A phosphates with phosphoetha-nolamine and 4-aminoarabinose is required for resistance to both polymxyin B ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) and Fe ( III ) ( Table 1 ) , raising the possibility that these bactericidal agents bind to similar or adjacent sites in lipid A. Consistent with this notion , the non-toxic poly-myxin B nonapeptide , which binds to lipid A like the bactericidal polymyxin B ( Yin et al. , 2003 ) , could partially rescue the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant from Fe ( III ) - mediated killing ( Fig. 1B ) . 
These results reinforce the notion that Fe ( III ) resistance is associated with modiﬁcation or occlusion of the lipid A phosphates in the LPS . 
PmrG is a phosphatase that targets the Hep(II) phosphate in the core region of the LPS
We then turned our attention to the pmrG mutant and determined that it exhibited a wild-type lipid A proﬁle and resistance to polymyxin B ( Fig . 
S3 and data not shown ) , which was in contrast to the phenotype of strains defective in the pmrC , pbgP or ugd genes ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
As overexpression of the pmrG gene did not alter the lipid A proﬁle of the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant ( Fig . 
S3 ) , our ﬁndings implied that the PmrG protein was not likely to target the lipid A . 
A hint to the potential function of the PmrG protein came from an independent genetic screening in which we mutagenized the DpmrAB strain and isolated pseudor-evertants that could grow on agar plates containing 400 mM Fe ( III ) . 
One of the pseudorevertants harboured a EZ-Tn5 ( http://www.epibio.com/category.asp?id=284 ) transposon insertion in the rfaY gene ( also known as waaY ) , which is necessary for phosphorylating the Hep ( II ) heptose in the core region of the LPS ( Yethon et al. , 1998 ) ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that deletion of the rfaY gene suppressed Fe ( III ) - mediated killing not only in the DpmrAB strain but also in the DpmrC pmrG ugd triple mutant ( Table 2 ) , restoring Fe ( III ) resistance to the levels exhibited by the DpmrAB strain harbouring the plasmid expressing the wild-type pmrG gene ( Table 2 ) . 
We hypothesized that the PmrG protein might counteract the action of the RfaY protein , removing the phosphate from the Hep ( II ) heptose . 
Thus , we puriﬁed a C-terminally His-tagged PmrG protein ( Fig. 2B ) and investigated its ability to dephosphorylate the core region of the LPS . 
The PmrG-His protein exhibited phosphatase activity towards core oligosaccharide ( OS ) prepared from the wild-type strain ( Fig. 2C ) , but not against OS originating from the DrfaY mutant ( Fig. 2C ) , which lacks the phosphate on Hep ( II ) ( Yethon et al. , 1998 ) . 
The data presented above indicate that the PmrG protein encodes a phosphatase that targets the Hep ( II ) phosphate in the core region of the LPS . 
PmrG protein is a periplasmic protein
To examine the subcellular location of the PmrG protein , we used a Salmonella strain that expressed a PmrG-FLAG protein from the normal chromosomal pmrG promoter , and also the cytoplasmic enzyme b-galactosidase , which served as a marker for the purity of the extracytoplasmic fractions . 
Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibodies demonstrated that the PmrG-FLAG protein localizes to the periplasmic region ( Fig. 3D ) , as predicted by the PSORT program ( http://www.psort.org/ ) . 
We also noticed a slightly larger band in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Fig. 3D ) , which could correspond to the full-length ( i.e. unprocessed ) form of the PmrG protein .

Modiﬁcation of the Hep(I) phosphate with phosphoethanolamine is not required for Fe(III) resistance
The core region of the LPS has two phosphates : one at Hep ( II ) that is targeted by PmrG ( Fig. 2C ) , and one at Hep ( I ) that can be modiﬁed with phosphoethanolamine by the PmrA-activated cptA gene product ( Tamayo et al. , 2005 ) . 
We determined that the latter modiﬁcation is not required for Fe ( III ) resistance because deletion of the cptA gene did not alter the susceptibility of the wild-type strain , the DpmrAB mutant , the DpmrC ugd , DpmrC pmrG

Metals that induce the PmrA/PmrB system promote killing of the DpmrC ugd pmrG mutant
Al ( III ) , which had been previously shown to be an inducer of the PmrA/PmrB system ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) , also displayed bactericidal activity against the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant ( Table 3 ) . 
On the other hand , neither Ca2 + nor Co2 + , K + , Ni2 + , Zn2 + , Mn2 + , Cu2 + , Ga3 + or Ru3 + ( at concentrations of up to 1 mM ) could induce PmrA-activated genes ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) or kill the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant ( data not shown ) . 
This suggests that there is correlation between the ability of a cation to activate the PmrA/PmrB system and its ability to kill the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant .

The LPS modiﬁcations mediating Fe(III) resistance enhance survival in soil
Salmonella can survive in non-host environments such as soil and water for extended periods of time ( Winﬁeld and Groisman , 2003 ) . 
Because Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) are the most abundant metals in soil ( Pina and Cervantes , 1996 ; Giesler et al. , 2005 ) and soil is an environment that activates the PmrA/PmrB system ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) , we hypothesized that the PmrA-regulated genes implicated in resistance to Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) would be required for survival in soil . 
Indeed , the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant was recovered 100-fold less than the wildtype strain following incubation in soil ( Fig. 3 ) .

Discussion
The LPS is the major constituent of the outer layer of the bacterial outer membrane . 
This makes the LPS a critical determinant of the permeability barrier that renders Gram-negative bacteria resistant to a variety of noxious compounds ( Raetz and Whitﬁeld , 2002 ) . 
The phosphates in the lipid A and core regions of the LPS are responsible for the negative charge that characterizes the bacterial cell surface . 
This negative charge mediates the electrostatic interaction with cationic bactericidal compounds such as certain antimicrobial peptides and the metals Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) . 
Consistent with this notion , covalent modiﬁcation and/or removal of the LPS phosphates can prevent binding and killing by these bactericidal agents . 
Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) are the speciﬁc signals that activate the Salmonella PmrA/PmrB regulatory system ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) , and exhibit bactericidal activity towards a DpmrAB mutant ( Tables 1 and 3 ) . 
The PmrA/PmrB system has been previously shown to control the expression of proteins mediating the modiﬁcation of the two lipid A phosphates with 4-aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine ( Groisman et al. , 1997 ; Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) , which results in resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B. Likewise , the PmrA-activated cptA gene is responsible for the phosphoethanolamine modiﬁcation of the Hep ( I ) phosphate in the core region ( Tamayo et al. , 2005 ) . 
We have now determined that the PmrA-activated PmrG protein is a phosphatase that removes the phosphate from the Hep ( II ) phosphate . 
Together , these data suggest that a major role of the PmrA/PmrB system is to govern the removal of negative charges conferred by the phosphates in the LPS . 
Inactivation of the PmrA-activated genes mediating the modiﬁcation of the two lipid A phosphates and the Hep ( II ) phosphate in the core region resulted in a strain ( i.e. the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant ) that was as susceptible to Fe ( III ) as the DpmrAB mutant ( Table 1 ) and that bound more iron than the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1B ) . 
This is in contrast to Salmonella strains defective in only one or two PmrA-regulated Fe ( III ) resistance genes , which retained wild-type levels of resistance ( Table 1 ) and binding ( Fig. 1B ) to Fe ( III ) . 
That the latter mutants did not exhibit intermediate susceptibility phenotypes between those displayed by the wild-type strain and the triple mutant implies that the bactericidal activity of Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) may require concurrent binding of these trivalent metals to the three LPS phosphates discussed above . 
This binding may be responsible for the destabilization of the outer membrane that renders Salmonella susceptible to lysis by the detergent deoxycholate and to killing by vancomycin ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) , agents that can not normally traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria ( Nikaido , 2003 ) . 
This effect could be due to the displacement of divalent cations such as Mg2 + that stabilize the outer membrane by cross-linking adjacent LPS molecules ( Raetz and Whitﬁeld , 2002 ) . 
Indeed , excess Mg2 + prevented Fe ( III ) - mediated killing ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) , suggesting that Mg2 + and Fe ( III ) share binding sites in the LPS . 
There appears to be an overlap between the sites targeted by Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) and by polymyxin B because modiﬁcation of the lipid A with phosphoethanolamine and 4-aminoarabinose is required for resistance to both the trivalent metals ( this work ) and the antibiotic ( Groisman et al. , 1997 ; Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
Moreover , the non-toxic polymyxin B nonapeptide could rescue D the pmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant from Fe ( III ) - mediated killing ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Yet , this overlap is only partial because the PmrG-mediated dephosphorylation of the Hep ( II ) phosphate is necessary for resistance to Fe ( III ) but not to polymyxin B , and because an rfaY mutation restored resistance to Fe ( III ) but not to polymyxin B upon the DpmrC ugd pmrG mutant . 
There is a correlation between the ability of a metal to activate the Salmonella PmrA/PmrB system and its ability to kill the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant . 
This is most striking in the inability of Ga3 + to exert either activity ( this work ) ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) despite having similar solution and co-ordination chemistries as Fe ( III ) , and to a lesser extent Al ( III ) . 
The reasons for these ﬁndings are presently unclear but do not appear to be + related to the contrasting capacities of Fe ( III ) and Ga3 to be reduced ( which are high and low respectively ) because aluminium 's only valency is three , yet it behaves like Fe ( III ) with respect to activation of the PmrA/PmrB system and bacterial killing . 
Whereas the PmrA/PmrB system responds to Fe ( III ) and is required for resistance to Fe ( III ) in both Salmo-nella and Escherichia coli ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ; Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ; Winﬁeld and Groisman , 2004 ) , it appears that its role in sensing and responding to Zn2 + is different in these two enteric species . 
In Salmonella , the 2 + PmrA/PmrB system neither responds to Zn ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) nor is required for resistance to Zn2 + ( this work ) . 
By contrast , Zn2 + has been shown to promote transcription of the pmrA and pmrB genes as well as that of several PmrA-activated genes in E. coli ( Lee et al. , 2005 ) . 
Zn2 + also inhibited the growth of pmrA and pmrB mutants of E. coli , which displayed a longer lag 2 + phase in the presence of Zn than the wild-type strain ( Lee et al. , 2005 ) . 
Finally , the DpmrC ugd pmrG triple mutant could not survive in soil ( Fig. 3 ) , which is an environment that

Fe ( III ) resistance determinants are necessary for survival in soil . 
Fe ( III ) sensitive mutants are impaired for growth in soil ( EG13937 and EG16639 ) . 
Survival ratio is the ratio of mutants to wild-type Salmonella ( 14028s ) . 
LPS modiﬁcations conferring Fe ( III ) resistance 651 induces transcription of PmrA-activated genes ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) , possibly because Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) are the most abundant metals in soil ( Pina and Cervantes , 1996 ; Giesler et al. , 2005 ) . 
This defect may be exacerbated in mild-acid conditions , such as those created by acid rain , which accelerate the elution of Fe ( III ) and Al ( III ) from soil ( Taborsky , 1991 ; Pina and Cervantes , 1996 ; Morrill et al. , 2004 ) . 
This implicates the PmrA/PmrB system in microbial survival in non-host environments , which may aid Salmonella transmission to new hosts . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and plasmids
Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table S1 . 
For plasmid constructions , genes were ampliﬁed from the wildtype strain 14028s genomic DNA by PCR with primers listed in Table S2 . 
The PCR fragments were cloned between the restriction enzyme sites of vector pBR322 as indicated in Table S1 , which resulted in these genes being present in the same orientation and downstream of the tet promoter of the pBR322 vector ( Bolivar et al. , 1977 ) . 
The construction of strains with deletions in particular genes was performed as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) with the primers listed in Table S2 . 
The drug-resistance genes were eliminated by using plasmid pCP20 as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
A strain expressing a chromosomally encoded PmrG-FLAG protein was constructed as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) with primers 5 ′ - AAACGGAAAACTCTTTT TAGATGGTGAATTTGTTCCCGGCGACTACAAGGACGAC GATGACAAGTAGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3 ′ enco-ding the FLAG sequence immediately upstream of the stop codon of the pmrG gene following the priming site 1 sequence ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) ( sequence in bold face corresponds to the FLAG coding sequence ) and 5 ′ - GACAGCCGCTTCAGGCTGTCTTTACGCTTTTAACATG CGGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3 ′ harbouring the sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of pmrG attached to priming site 2 ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
Selecting for Fe(III) resistance genes
A genomic library from the DpmrAB strain EG13937 was made in pBR322 as follows : chromosomal DNA prepared from an overnight culture of the DpmrAB strain was digested with Sau3AI ( 1 U ml-1 ) for 15 , 20 , 30 or 40 min . 
The digested DNA was separated on 0.8 % agarose gel , and fragments of approximately 2 -- 10 kb in size were puriﬁed and ligated into the BamHI site of vector pBR322 . 
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5a selecting for ampicillin-resistant transformants . 
Plasmid DNA was prepared from a pool of 26 000 transformants and used to transform the DpmrAB deletion strain EG13937 . 
Cells were plated on N-minimal pH 5.8 10 mM MgCl2 agarose plates containing 50 mg of ampicillin/ml and 200 mM FeCl3 . 
The MIC was determined on N-minimal pH 5.8 10 mM MgCl2 agarose plates containing twofold dilutions of FeCl3 or Al2 ( SO4 ) 3 . 
To determine the MIC , bacteria were grown over-night in N-minimal media with 10 mM MgCl2 , pH 7.7 at 37 °C , then diluted into N-minimal media with 10 mM MgCl2 , pH 5.8 , and organisms were tested at a ﬁnal inoculum size of 104 colony-forming units ( cfu ) per ml with the use of a multipoint inoculator ( Sakuma Seisakusyo , Tokyo , Japan ) , following a 20 h incubation at 37 °C . 
The MIC was the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited cell growth . 
MIC determinations were repeated at least three times . 
Iron and soil killing assays, and polymyxin B nonapeptide competition assays
Overnight cultures grown in N-minimal media 10 mM MgCl2 pH 7.7 at 37 °C were washed and used to inoculate N-minimal media 10 mM MgCl2 pH 5.8 . 
After a 4 h incubation at 37 °C , cells were diluted 1:100 in the same media . 
Fifty microlitres of diluted cells was mixed with 50 ml of FeCl3 dissolved in the same media to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mM FeCl . 
For the 3 competition assay , polymyxin B nonapeptide ( Sigma ) was added to this mixture at a ﬁnal concentration of 1.25 mM . 
For polymyxin B killing assay , 50 ml of diluted cells were mixed with 50 ml of polymyxin B ( Sigma ) solution dissolved in the same media at a ﬁnal concentration of 2.5 mg ml-1 . 
The mixtures in U-bottom 96-well microtiter plate were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 120 min . 
At this time , cells were put on ice , serial dilutions were conducted , 50 ml were plated onto LB agar plates and the number of colonies was recorded following overnight incubation at 37 °C . 
To investigate killing in soil , bacterial cultures were mixed with an equal volume of soil solution ( dissolved in N-minimal media 10 mM MgCl2 pH 5.8 ) . 
The mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C before bacterial viability was assessed by dilution and plating as described above for the iron killing assay . 
b-Galactosidase assays 
59Fe association assay
59Fe associated with cells was determined using a Packard Cobra II g counter as described ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2002 ) . 
The percentage of 59Fe association was calculated as the amount of 59Fe per colony-forming unit ( cpm cfu-1 ) . 
Mass spectrometry analysis of lipid A
Lipid A samples were prepared as described previously ( Yi and Hackett , 2000 ) , with a slight modiﬁcation . 
Bacteria were grown overnight in N-minimal media with 10 mM MgCl2 , pH 7.7 at 37 °C . 
Then , the cells were washed and diluted into N-minimal media with 10 mM MgCl2 , pH 5.8 to be a ﬁnal inoculum size of 104 cfu ml-1 . 
Sixty microlitres ( 60 spots of 1 ml diluted cells ) of each strain was spotted onto an N-minimal pH 5.8 10 mM MgCl2 agarose plate containing 50 mM FeCl3 with the use of a multipoint inoculator ( Sakuma Seisakusyo , Tokyo , Japan ) , followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 h . 
The cells were then harvested , washed , and suspended in 0.8 ml PBS , pH 7.4 . 
Preparation of lipid A samples and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses of lipid A were performed in the negative ion mode on a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer ( PerSptive Biosystems ) as described ( Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
Phosphatase activity assay
Core OS was prepared as described ( Yethon et al. , 1998 ) . 
The PhoP-His and PmrG-His proteins were puriﬁed using the Ni-NTA Spin kit ( Qiagen ) as described by the manufacturer . 
Production of free phosphate was assayed as described ( Harder et al. , 1994 ) . 
Puriﬁed protein ( 1 mg ) was incubated with core OS substrate for 30 min at 37 °C . 
Free Pi generated in the assay was measured by malachite green assay using BIOMOL GREEN ™ reagent ( BIOMOL Res Laboratories ) and a microplate reader at 620 nm . 
Data were corrected for background activity by subtracting the absorbance of the samples lacking core OS from those incubated in the presence of core OS . 
b-Galactosidase activity was determined as described ( Miller , 1972 ) . 
b-Galactosidase assays 
Localization of the PmrG protein
Periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared by the osmotic shock procedure as described ( Neu and Heppel , 1965 ) .
