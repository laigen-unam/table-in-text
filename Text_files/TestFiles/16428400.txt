FljA-Mediated Posttranscriptional Control of Phase 1 Flagellin Expression
in Flagellar Phase Variation of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Shouji Yamamoto1 and Kazuhiro Kutsukake1 ,2 * Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology ,1 and Department of Biology , Faculty of Science ,2 Okayama University , Tsushima-Naka 3-1-1 , Okayama 700-8530 , Japan 
Received 13 September 2005/Accepted 7 November 2005 
Flagellar phase variation of Salmonella is a phenomenon where two ﬂagellin genes , ﬂiC ( phase 1 ) and ﬂjB ( phase 2 ) , are expressed alternately . 
This is controlled by the inversion of a DNA segment containing the promoter for the ﬂjB gene . 
The ﬂjB gene constitutes an operon with the ﬂjA gene , which encodes a negative regulator for ﬂiC expression . 
Previous biochemical analysis suggested that phase variation might depend on alternative synthesis of phase-speciﬁc ﬂagellin mRNA ( H. Suzuki and T. Iino , J. Mol . 
Biol . 
81:57 -- 70 , 1973 ) . 
However , recently reported results suggested that FljA-dependent inhibition might be mediated by a posttranscriptional control mechanism ( H. R. Boniﬁeld and K. T. Hughes , J. Bacteriol . 
185:3567 -- 3574 , 2003 ) . 
In this study , we reexamined the mechanism of FljA-mediated inhibition of ﬂiC expression more carefully . 
Northern blotting analysis revealed that no ﬂiC mRNA was detected in phase 2 cells . 
However , only a moderate decrease in - galactosidase activity was observed from the ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene in phase 2 cells compared with that in phase 1 cells . 
In contrast , the expression of the ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion gene was severely impaired in phase 2 cells . 
The half-life of ﬂiC mRNA was shown to be much shorter in phase 2 cells than in phase 1 cells . 
Puriﬁed His-tagged FljA protein was shown to bind speciﬁcally to ﬂiC mRNA and inhibit the translation from ﬂiC mRNA in vitro . 
On the basis of these results , we propose that in phase 2 cells , FljA binds to ﬂiC mRNA and inhibits its translation , which in turn facilitates its degradation . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has 5 to 10 ﬂagella per cell . 
The individual ﬂagellum is composed of three substructures , a basal body , a hook , and a ﬁlament ( 33 ) . 
The ﬁlament extends into the extracellular space and is up to 10 m in length . 
Although the ﬁlament is the largest substructure in the ﬂagellum , it is composed of a single species of protein , ﬂagellin . 
Serovar Typhimurium has two nonallelic ﬂagellin genes , ﬂiC and ﬂjB , which encode antigenically distinct proteins . 
Individual cells express only one of these two ﬂagellin genes and alternate the expression between the two at a rate of 10 3 to 10 5 per cell generation . 
This phenomenon is known as ﬂagellar phase variation , and the FliC-expressing cells are called phase 1 , while FljB-expressing cells are called phase 2 ( 19 ) . 
Flagellar phase variation is controlled by the reversible inversion of a DNA segment , called the H segment , containing the promoter for the ﬂjB gene ( 55 , 56 ) . 
The H segment is ﬂanked by inverted repetitious sequences , hixL and hixR , between which site-speciﬁc recombination occurs , leading to H inversion ( 25 ) . 
The cognate recombinase , called DNA invertase , is encoded by the hin gene , which is located within the H segment ( 28 , 29 , 47 ) . 
The ﬂjB gene constitutes an operon together with the ﬂjA gene , which encodes a negative regulator for ﬂiC expression ( 12 , 13 , 40 , 48 ) . 
Therefore , when the H segment is in the `` on '' orientation , both the ﬂjB and ﬂjA genes are transcribed , resulting in phase 2 ﬂagellin being synthesized and the ﬂiC gene being repressed . 
On the other hand , when the

H segment turns to the `` off '' orientation , neither ﬂjB nor ﬂjA is expressed , resulting in phase 1 ﬂagellin being synthesized . 
A pioneering study to understand the molecular mechanism of FljA-mediated inhibition of the ﬂiC expression in phase 2 cells was performed previously by Suzuki and Iino ( 50 ) . 
They isolated mRNAs from phase 1 and phase 2 cells separately and used them as templates in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system . 
They found that the ﬂagellin molecules synthesized were of the same phase as the cells from which the mRNAs were derived . 
This indicated that phase 2 cells did not contain ﬂiC mRNA , suggesting that ﬂiC repression should be accomplished at a transcriptional level . 
Inoue et al. ( 21 ) isolated mutants whose ﬂiC expression became insensitive to FljA . 
Their mutation sites were mapped around the Shine-Dalgarno ( SD ) sequence of the ﬂiC gene , which locates far downstream of the ﬂiC promoter . 
This situation is unusual because the classical operator sequences are usually located close to or within the promoter regions ( 9 ) . 
This suggested the possibility that FljA-mediated inhibition of ﬂiC expression might occur at a translational level . 
Recently , Boniﬁeld and Hughes ( 2 ) showed that FljA reduced - galactosidase activity 200-fold from the ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion gene , while FljA reduced the enzyme activity from the ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene by only ﬁvefold and the steady-state level of ﬂiC mRNA by only threefold . 
Based on these results , they proposed that FljA might act at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
This study was aimed at understanding the mechanism of ﬂiC repression by FljA at a molecular level . 
To address this issue , we reexamined the mechanism of ﬂiC repression by FljA more carefully . 
Northern blotting analysis revealed that no ﬂiC mRNA was detected in phase 2 cells . 
However , only a marginal or moderate decrease in - galactosidase activity was observed from the ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene in phase 2 cells . 
In contrast , the expression of the ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion gene was severely impaired in phase 2 cells . 
We further showed that the half-life of ﬂiC mRNA was much shorter in phase 2 cells than in phase 1 cells . 
Using puriﬁed His-tagged FljA protein , FljA was shown to bind speciﬁcally to ﬂiC mRNA and inhibit the translation in vitro from ﬂiC mRNA . 
On the basis of these results , we propose the mechanism of posttranscriptional control of ﬂiC expression by FljA in phase 2 cells .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids . 
Salmonella strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
LT2 has another DNA invertase gene , ﬁn , in addition to hin ( 32 ) . 
KK211 and KK212 are phase-locked mutants of LT2 whose H segments are ﬁxed in the `` on '' and `` off '' orientations , respectively , due to null mutations in both hin and ﬁn genes ( 32 ) . 
Therefore , KK211 is ﬁxed in phase 1 and does not express FljA , whereas KK212 is ﬁxed in phase 2 and expresses FljA constitutively . 
When mRNAs transcribed from plasmid-borne ﬂiC genes were analyzed , KK211CT and KK212CT were used as host strains . 
These strains carry an ﬂiC : : Tn10 mutation introduced from KK2604 by P22-mediated transduction . 
KK211CL and KK212CL carry a chromosomal ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene introduced from KK1110 by P22-mediated transduction . 
The Escherichia coli strain used was JM109 ( 53 ) .

Using this plasmid as a template , a DNA sequence encompassing the promoter through the last codon of the ﬂiC gene was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers ( ﬂiC ) SmaIS and ( ﬂiC ) SmaIE . 
The ampliﬁed product was digested with SmaI and inserted into the corresponding site of pMC1871 to obtain pMCIC0 . 
In this plasmid , the lacZ gene was translationally fused to the entire ﬂiC open reading frame ( ORF ) and expressed under the transcriptional and translational control of the ﬂiC gene . 
Using the same template , a DNA sequence encompassing the promoter through the termination codon of the ﬂiC gene was PCR ampliﬁed with primers ( ﬂiC ) S1 ( Sph ) 124 and ( ﬂiC ) Eco3E .

RNA binding assay . 
The structure of the RNA fragments used for the gel mobility shift assay is shown in Fig. 2 . 
They were prepared as follows . 
DNAs of pSPT18ﬂiCUTR-ORF and pSPT18trcUTR-ﬂiCORF were linearized by digestion with HincII and used as templates for runoff transcription by T7 RNA polymerase to obtain 121 - and 98-nucleotide transcripts , respectively . 
The former ( named RNA C ) contains a 5 portion ( positions 1 to 100 ) of native ﬂiC mRNA , and the latter ( named RNA T ) contains the trc 5 - UTR ( positions 1 to 39 ) and the 5 portion of the ﬂiC ORF ( positions 63 to 100 ) . 
These RNAs were gel puriﬁed , dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phospha-tase ( Toyobo ) , and then labeled at the 5 end with [ -32 P ] ATP ( Amersham Biosciences ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Toyobo ) . 
The binding reaction mixture ( 20 l ) contained 0.5 nM labeled RNA , 10 mM Tris-acetate ( pH 7.5 ) , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM NaCl , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM dithiothreitol , 5 % glycerol , and various concentrations of His-FljA . 
In the competition assay , unlabeled RNA competitors were added to the reaction mixture at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM . 
The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C on native 6 % polyacrylamide gels containing 5 % glycerol in 0.5 TBE buffer ( 46 mM Tris base , 46 mM boric acid , 1 mM EDTA ) . 
Labeled RNAs were detected by autoradiography . 
RESULTS
Absence of ﬂiC mRNA in phase 2 cells . 
In order to resolve the confusion regarding two previously reported conﬂicting results on the ﬂiC mRNA level in phase 2 cells ( 2 , 50 ) , we performed Northern blotting analysis of ﬂagellin mRNAs using ﬂiC - and ﬂjB-speciﬁc RNA probes . 
The probes used were designed to be complementary to the central regions of the respective ﬂagellin mRNAs . 
Since the central region corresponds to the sequence-variable domain of ﬂagellin ( 26 ) , the respective probe was expected to hybridize speciﬁcally with either ﬂiC or ﬂjB transcript . 
In hybridization with the ﬂiCspeciﬁc probe ( probe 2 ) , an approximately 1.6-kb band was detected in the mRNA sample prepared from phase 1 cells ( KK211 ) , whereas no band was observed in the mRNA sample prepared from phase 2 cells ( KK212 ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Since the size of this band is equivalent to the expected size of ﬂiC mRNA we conclude that this band corresponds to ﬂiC mRNA . 
Conversely , in the hybridization with the ﬂjB-speciﬁc probe ( probe 3 ) , an approximately 1.6-kb band was detected in the mRNA sample prepared from phase 2 cells , whereas no band was detected in the mRNA sample prepared from phase 1 cells ( Fig. 3B ) . 
The full-length size of mRNA for the ﬂjBA operon is estimated to be approximately 2.2 kb , which is larger than the size of the band detected in Fig. 3B . 
It was known that a - independent terminator exists between the ﬂjB and ﬂjA genes and that 99 % of mRNAs initiated from the ﬂjB promoter stop transcription at this terminator , yielding a 1.6-kb RNA transcript ( 16 ) . 
Therefore , we conclude that the 1.6-kb band hybridized with the ﬂjB probe corresponds to the ﬂjB transcript . 
These results clearly indicate that ﬂiC mRNA is absent from phase 2 cells , which is consistent with results previously reported by Suzuki and Iino ( 50 ) . 
Boniﬁeld and Hughes ( 2 ) used a T2 RNase protection assay to show that ﬂiC mRNA was produced even in phase 2 cells . 
The RNA probe that they used is complementary to the ﬁrst 200 nucleotides of ﬂiC mRNA . 
This region is highly homologous ( 92.1 % identity ) to the corresponding region of ﬂjB mRNA , suggesting that this probe could hybridize with not only ﬂiC mRNA but also ﬂjB mRNA . 
Therefore , we suppose that the amount of ﬂiC mRNA in phase 2 cells might have been overestimated in their T2 protection assay . 
This supposition is supported by our Northern blotting analysis with probe 1 , which covers the ﬁrst 300 nucleotides of ﬂiC mRNA . 
As expected , this probe hybridized with the 1.6-kb RNA extracted from phase 2 cells as well as that from phase 1 cells ( data not shown ) . 
Gene fusion analysis of ﬂiC expression in the presence of FljA . 
The results described above led us to reexamine the effect of FljA on the expression of ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional and translational fusion genes . 
Two types of transcriptional fusions were used in this study . 
One was a chromosomal ﬂiC-lacZ fusion ( 30 ) , in which the Mud1 ( amp lac ) phage DNA had been inserted into the ﬂiC ORF after nucleotide position 941 from the transcriptional start site , and the other was a ﬂiC-lacZ fusion gene on a plasmid , pRLIC0 , in which a DNA segment ( positions 35 through 1550 ) containing the promoter-op-erator region and the entire ﬂiC ORF with its stop codon was fused transcriptionally to the lacZ gene on a promoter-probe vector , pRL124 . 
In the chromosomal fusion , - galactosidase activity was reduced 2.5-fold in phase 2 cells compared with that in phase 1 cells ( Table 4 ) . 
With the fusion gene on the plasmid , a small reduction in the enzyme activity was also observed in phase 2 cells . 
The ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion gene used was on a plasmid , pMCIC0 , in which the DNA segment ( positions 35 through 1547 ) containing the promoter-operator region and the entire ORF of ﬂiC without its stop codon was fused translationally to the lacZ gene on a vector , pMC1871 . 
In phase 2 cells , - galactosidase activity was reduced 10-fold compared with that in phase 1 cells ( Table 4 ) . 
Therefore , in the analysis with ﬂiC-lacZ fusion genes , FljA is able to repress ﬂiC expression at both transcriptional and translational levels , and the translational repression is more profound . 
These results coincide with those from the chromosomal gene fusion study reported previously by Boniﬁeld and Hughes ( 2 ) . 
Effect of FljA on stability of ﬂiC mRNA . 
The above-men-tioned results mean that ﬂiC mRNA is absent from phase 2 cells , although a low but considerable level of transcription of the ﬂiC gene occurs in phase 2 cells . 
This raised the possibility a Strains used for the - galactosidase assay are as follows : chromosomal ﬂiC-lacZ fusion gene , KK211CL ( phase 1 ) and KK212CL ( phase 2 ) ; plasmid-borne ﬂiC-lacZ fusion gene , KK211 ( phase 1 ) and KK212 ( phase 2 ) that the ﬂiC gene might be transcribed efﬁciently in phase 2 cells but that the synthesized ﬂiC mRNA might be degraded rapidly in the presence of FljA . 
In order to test this possibility , we examined the effect of FljA on the stability of ﬂiC mRNA . 
Total RNA was isolated from phase 1 cells at various time points after rifampin addition and analyzed by Northern blotting with probe 2 ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The half-life of the ﬂiC mRNA calculated from the band density was approximately 5 min . 
In order to make it possible to detect ﬂiC mRNA in phase 2 cells , we used cells harboring pICP1 , a multicopy plasmid carrying a DNA segment between positions 35 and 102 of the ﬂiC gene followed by the rrnB terminator , producing a 415-nucle-otide mRNA transcribed from the ﬂiC promoter . 
As shown in Fig. 3C , the steady-state level of the ﬂiC mRNA encoded by pICP1 was much reduced in phase 2 cells compared with that in phase 1 cells . 
This indicates that the ﬂiC DNA sequence downstream of position 103 is dispensable for regulation by FljA . 
However , a low but detectable amount of ﬂiC mRNA was produced from pICP1 even in the phase 2 cells ( Fig. 3C ) , probably because of a high level of expression of ﬂiC mRNA from a multicopy plasmid . 
This enabled us to measure the half-life of ﬂiC mRNA in the presence of FljA . 
In phase 1 cells , the half-life of ﬂiC mRNA from pICP1 was approximately 5 min ( Fig. 4B ) , which is equivalent to that of the full-length ﬂiC mRNA transcribed from a chromosomal ﬂiC gene . 
In contrast , the half-life of ﬂiC mRNA in phase 2 cells was less than 1 min ( Fig. 4C ) , which is much shorter than that in phase 1 cells . 
This result suggested that the absence of ﬂiC mRNA in phase 2 cells might result from its loss of stability in the presence of FljA . 
Effect of FljA on ﬂiC mRNA expression from a foreign promoter . 
The operator mutations that rendered ﬂiC expression insensitive to FljA were all mapped within the 5 - UTR of the ﬂiC gene , but their positions are far downstream ( positions 46 to 59 ) of the ﬂiC promoter ( 21 ) . 
This suggested that the DNA sequence around the ﬂiC promoter is not important for regulation by FljA . 
To address this issue , we constructed a hybrid plasmid , pIC495-2 , in which a full-length ﬂiC mRNA including its native 5 - UTR is transcribed from the trc promoter and transcription terminates at the rrnB terminator , yielding a 1,868-nucleotide transcript ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Total RNA isolated from cells harboring this plasmid was analyzed by Northern blotting with probe 2 . 
The amount of ﬂiC mRNA was much reduced in phase 2 cells compared with that in phase 1 cells half-life of ﬂiC mRNAs from pICP2M ( less than 1 min ) was much shorter than that from pICP2 ( approximately 5 min ) . 
Binding of FljA to ﬂiC mRNA . 
DNA binding activity was not observed in the puriﬁed His-FljA protein in a gel mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled ﬂiC DNA as a probe ( data not shown ) . 
The fact that FljA inhibits the translation of ﬂiC mRNA suggested that FljA binds to ﬂiC mRNA . 
In order to test this , a gel mobility shift assay was performed using 32P-labeled ﬂiC mRNA ( RNA C ) synthesized in vitro . 
This RNA was composed of the ﬁrst 100 nucleotides of ﬂiC mRNA containing the putative operator sequence . 
A shifted band was detected in the presence of 5 nM His-FljA . 
When 32P-labeled RNA lacking the putative operator sequence ( RNA T ) was used , no shifted band was observed even in the presence of 500 nM His-FljA ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Binding speciﬁcity was examined by a competition experiment using unlabeled RNAs as competitors . 
As a result , the unlabeled RNA C behaved as an effective competitor , whereas the unlabeled RNA T did not , indicating a high spec-iﬁcity in binding of FljA to ﬂiC mRNA containing the operator sequence .

( Fig. 3D ) , indicating that FljA can repress the ﬂiC gene even under the control of the trc promoter . 
Next , we analyzed ﬂiC expression using cells harboring pIC495-1 in which not only the promoter but also the entire 5 - UTR of the ﬂiC gene had been replaced with those of trc ( Fig. 1 ) . 
From this plasmid , approximately equal amounts of the hybrid ﬂiC mRNA were produced in phase 1 and phase 2 cells ( Fig. 3E ) . 
Therefore , we conclude that the 5 - UTR of the ﬂiC gene or transcript that includes the putative operator sequence plays an important role in FljA-dependent regulation . 
Translational repression of the ﬂiC gene by FljA . 
His6-tagged FljA ( His-FljA ) was puriﬁed as described in Materials and Methods and used for in vitro analysis of ﬂiC expression . 
In the in vitro transcription-translation-coupled system with an E. coli S30 extract , two plasmids , pIC495-1 and pIC495-2 , were used as templates . 
The FliC proteins synthesized were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FliC antibody ( Fig. 5A ) . 
In the absence of His-FljA , FliC was synthesized from both templates . 
However , when His-FljA was added at a 100-fold molar excess over the template DNA , FliC was not synthesized from pIC495-2 . 
In contrast , FliC synthesis from pIC495-1 was not affected signiﬁcantly in this condition . 
In order to know whether transcription or translation of the ﬂiC gene was inhibited by FljA , we performed an in vitro transcription experiment using E. coli RNA polymerase ho-loenzyme . 
It was found that the addition of His-FljA at up to a 100-fold molar excess over the DNA template did not affect the production of ﬂiC transcript ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Next , we performed an in vitro translation experiment with an E. coli S30 extract using in vitro-synthesized ﬂiC mRNA as a template . 
FliC was synthesized in the absence of His-FljA , whereas FliC synthesis was completely inhibited in the presence of His-FljA at a 10-fold molar excess over the template RNA ( Fig. 5C ) . 
In this experiment , stability of ﬂiC mRNA was also monitored by Northern blotting . 
It was shown that the presence of His-FljA did not affect the stability of ﬂiC mRNA ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicate that FljA inhibits translation , and not transcription , of the ﬂiC gene in vitro . 
Stability of ﬂiC mRNA in the absence of its translation . 
According to the results described above , FljA facilitates the degradation of ﬂiC mRNA in vivo , whereas FljA inhibits the translation of ﬂiC mRNA in vitro . 
This raised the possibility that FljA-enhanced degradation of ﬂiC mRNA in vivo may result from the inhibition of its translation by FljA . 
In order to test this possibility , two plasmids , pICP2 and pICP2M , were constructed ( Fig. 1 ) . 
pICP2 encodes a C-terminally truncated FliC . 
In pICP2M , the initiation codon , ATG , of the ﬂiC gene on pICP2 was replaced with CTG , which was expected to inhibit the translation of the ﬂiC gene . 
Cells harboring either one of these plasmids were examined for production of ﬂiC mRNA and FliC protein by Northern blotting with probe 1 and Western blotting with anti-FliC antibody , respectively . 
As expected , FliC protein was not produced from pICP2M even in phase 1 cells ( Fig. 6B ) . 
It was shown that the steady-state level of ﬂiC mRNA from pICP2M was much reduced even in phase 1 cells ( Fig. 6B ) . 
This suggests that ﬂiC mRNA is destabilized in the absence of its translation . 
In order to conﬁrm this , we compared the half-lives of ﬂiC mRNAs from pICP2 and pICP2M in phase 1 cells ( Fig. 6C and D ) . 
As expected , th

DISCUSSION
The dual controlling system governs ﬂagellar phase variation of Salmonella ; one part of the system is Hin-mediated inversion of the H segment containing the promoter for the ﬂjBA operon , and the other is FljA-mediated inhibition of the ﬂiC expression . 
Although the mechanism of the former system has already been well documented at a molecular level ( 18 , 24 , 25 ) , there have been very few studies on the mechanism of the latter system . 
Suzuki and Iino ( 50 ) showed that phase 2 cells did not contain mRNA with FliC-synthesizing activity . 
Since then , FljA-mediated repression of the ﬂiC gene has long been believed to be achieved at a transcriptional level . 
However , Boniﬁeld and Hughes ( 2 ) showed evidence suggesting that this repression might occur mainly at a posttranscriptional level 
This study was carried out to clarify this discrepancy . 
We showed that ﬂiC mRNA was not detected in the presence of FljA , which coincides with the observation previously reported by Suzuki and Iino ( 50 ) . 
However , in the ﬂiC-lacZ gene fusion analysis , FljA-dependent repression was not so strong at the transcriptional level but was severe at the translational level , which conforms to the observation reported previously by Boniﬁeld and Hughes ( 2 ) . 
In order to explain these conﬂicting results , we examined the effect of FljA on the stability of ﬂiC mRNA and found that it was much shorter in the presence of FljA than in the absence of FljA . 
Therefore , we can explain the above-mentioned conﬂicting results as follows : in phase 2 cells , transcription of the ﬂiC gene occurs , but synthesized ﬂiC mRNA is degraded rapidly in the presence of FljA . 
Using puriﬁed His-tagged FljA protein , we showed that FljA binds speciﬁcally to ﬂiC mRNA and inhibits the translation in vitro from ﬂiC mRNA . 
Consistent with this , FljA belongs to a superfamily of Lsm ribonucleoproteins , which includes important modulators of RNA biosynthesis and function ( 17 , 27 ) . 
The binding afﬁnity of FljA to ﬂiC mRNA seems to be very low , because a complete shift could not be attained in a gel mobility shift assay in the presence of FljA , even at a 1,000-fold molar excess over ﬂiC mRNA ( Fig. 7 ) . 
This suggests a possibility that another protein ( s ) may be required for maximal interaction between FljA and ﬂiC mRNA . 
Previously isolated operator mutations that rendered ﬂiC expression insensitive to FljA deﬁned the putative operator site around the SD sequence of the ﬂiC gene ( 21 ) . 
It is reasonable to postulate that this putative operator sequence acts as the FljA-binding site . 
This site locates within the 5 - UTR of the ﬂiC gene and thus is transcribed into mRNA . 
Therefore , we propose that FljA binds to ﬂiC mRNA at this site . 
Consistent with this , the ﬂiC mRNA lacking this sequence showed no activity to bind FljA in the gel mobility shift assay ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Because the SD sequence should act as a ribosome-binding site ( 46 ) , binding of FljA to this site may prevent ribosomes from binding to this site , which leads to translation inhibition of the ﬂiC gene . 
Therefore , like some ribosomal proteins such as S4 and S15 of E. coli ( 10 , 11 , 41 ) and Reg protein of bacteriophage T4 ( 52 ) , FljA must act as a translational repressor . 
Next , we consider a possible mechanism whereby ﬂiC mRNA is destabilized in phase 2 cells . 
In several genes , translating ribosomes have been known to interfere with the deg-radation of mRNAs ( 3 , 6 , 22 , 23 , 42 , 54 ) . 
For example , ribosomes inhibit an RNase E cleavage of rpsO mRNA in E. coli ( 3 ) . 
By analogy with this , we propose that in phase 2 cells , FljA binds to ﬂiC mRNA and inhibits its translation , which in turn facilitates its degradation . 
This is supported by our observation that an engineered untranslatable ﬂiC mRNA was degraded rapidly even in the absence of FljA ( Fig. 6 ) . 
It is unlikely that FljA itself may act as an RNase responsible for the degradation of ﬂiC mRNA , because FljA did not facilitate the degradation of ﬂiC mRNA in vitro ( data not shown ) . 
In our preliminary experiment , ﬂiC mRNA was shown to be stabilized in the mutant defective in the RNase E gene even in the presence of FljA ( our unpublished results ) , suggesting that the degradosome including RNase E ( 4 ) may be implicated in this regulation . 
In the ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene , a weak decrease in - galactosidase activity was observed in the presence of FljA ( Table 4 ) . 
This suggests that transcriptional repression may also be involved in FljA-mediated inhibition of ﬂiC expression . 
The ﬂjA gene is known to be transcribed inefﬁciently , owing to the - independent terminator between the ﬂjB and ﬂjA genes ( 16 ) . 
This is also supported by our observation that a fulllength ﬂjBA mRNA was hardly observed in phase 2 cells ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Therefore , the cellular level of FljA should be signiﬁcantly low . 
However , in this study , the chromosomal ﬂjA gene was found to be able to inhibit the expression of the ﬂiC gene on multicopy plasmids ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This indicates that multiple DNA copies of the operator sequence can not efﬁciently titrate the intracellular FljA proteins . 
Consistent with this , the DNA fragment containing the operator sequence showed no activity to bind FljA in a gel mobility shift assay ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , it is unlikely that FljA may repress transcription of the ﬂiC gene by binding to the operator site on DNA . 
At present we can not think of a special mechanism for transcriptional repression by FljA . 
However , there is a possibility that the ﬂiC-lacZ hybrid mRNA transcribed from the ﬂiC-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene may be susceptible to RNase attack due to the presence of an FljA-binding site , which may reduce - galactosidase activity to some extent in the presence of FljA . 
We also showed that the chromosomal ﬂjA gene is sufﬁcient to inhibit ﬂiC expression from the trc promoter , which is known to be one of the strongest promoters in bacteria ( 38 ) . 
This suggests that overproduced ﬂiC mRNAs can not titrate intracellular FljA proteins either . 
This is not a surprising result , because ﬂiC mRNA is degraded rapidly in the presence of FljA ( Fig. 4 ) . 
However , the possibility that the binding afﬁnity of FljA to ﬂiC mRNA is too low to titrate out the cellular FljA proteins can not be ruled out . 
In Fig. 8 , we summarize the present understanding of the mechanism controlling ﬂagellar phase variation of Salmonella . 
H inversion is an on-off switch of transcription of the ﬂjBA operon , whereas FljA is a posttranscriptional regulator of the ﬂiC operon . 
It is believed that posttranscriptional control enables bacteria to quickly adjust their gene expression to environmental changes ( 8 , 14 , 43 , 44 , 49 ) . 
Flagellar ﬁlaments or ﬂagellin subunits act as potent antigens in host organisms , and there have been several reports suggesting that ﬂagellar phase variation might inﬂuence the virulence phenotype of Salmo-nella ( 7 , 20 , 45 , 51 ) . 
Therefore , it is possible that the mode of its genetic control may have some effect on the growth or survival of Salmonella cells in hosts . 
However , at present , the biological signiﬁcance of Salmonella employing posttranscriptional control for FljA-mediated inhibition of ﬂiC expression remains unknown . 
Two FljA paralogues are known to exist : one is HCM2 .0081 , encoded by a plasmid , pHCM2 , found in S. enterica serovar Typhi CT18 ( 39 ) , and the other is Y1019 , encoded by a plasmid , pMT1 , found in Yersinia pestis KIM ( 35 ) . 
More than 30 % of their amino acids are identical to those of FljA ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , although their function has not yet been characterized , it is reasonable to postulate that they may regulate gene expression through a mechanism similar to FljA .
