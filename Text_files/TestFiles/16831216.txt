Invasive Salmonella has been reported to induce apoptosis of macrophages as part of its infection process , which may allow it to avoid detection by the innate immune system . 
However , the induction of apoptosis under the different host environments remains to be examined , including the oxidative stress experienced by pathogens in the macrophage milieu . 
To simulate in vivo oxidative conditions , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was grown in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and its ability to induce apoptosis of murine macrophages was assessed . 
Analysis of data revealed that oxidative stressed S. Typhi caused apoptotic cell death in 51 % of macrophages , whereas S. Typhi grown under normal conditions accounted for apoptotic cell death in only 32 % of macrophages . 
A signiﬁcant increase in the levels of oxidants and decrease in the antioxidant was also observed which correlated with the increased generation of tumour necrosis factor a , interleukin-1a and interleukin-6 . 
These results suggest that tumour necrosis factor a in conjunction with other cytokines may induce apoptotic cell death through the upregulation of lipid peroxidation and down-regulation of superoxide dismutase . 
This ﬁnding may help us to understand better the host -- pathogen interactions and may be of clinical importance in the development of preventive intervention against infection .

Introduction
Microorganism -- macrophage interactions play a central role in the pathogenesis of many infections . 
Macrophages serve essential functions as regulators of immunity and homeostasis ( Celada & Nathan , 1994 ; Gordon , 1998 ) . 
As participants in native immunity , macrophages phagocytose and kill invading microorganisms and elaborate signaling mole-cules that amplify acute inﬂammatory responses . 
Macro-phages also contribute to acquired immune responses by means of specialized functions that include antigen presentation and regulation of T-cell responses . 
Thus regulation of macrophage differentiation and survival is critical for the overall control of the magnitude , duration and characteristics of immune responses ( Valledor et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , some bacterial pathogens have the capacity to induce macrophage apoptosis to elude innate immune responses and successfully colonize the host ( Zychlinsky et al. , 1992 ; Hersh et al. , 1999 ; Weinrauch & Zychlinsky , 1999 ; Valledor et al. , 2004 ; Takaya et al. , 2005 ) . 
Depending upon the pathogen , host cell apoptosis can be detrimental or bene-ﬁcial to pathogenesis . 
A successful pathogen manipulates its host for its own beneﬁt ( Knodler & Finlay , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella , an intracellular pathogen capable of causing gastroenteritis , typhoid and septicaemia , triggers programmed cell death in macro-phages ( Chen & Zychlinsky , 1994 ; Monack et al. , 1996 ; Knodler & Finlay , 2001 ) . 
It appears that the outcome of the interaction of Salmonella with macrophages depends on the relative contribution of two type III protein secretion systems , in conjunction with the stimulation of innate immunity outputs through conserved determinants collectively known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) ( Hueffer & Galan , 2004 ) . 
These interactions result in a breakdown of the balance between survival and pro-apoptotic cellular pathways , eventually leading to macro-phage cell death ( Hueffer & Galan , 2004 ; Guiney , 2005 ) . 
During the infection process , Salmonella encounters the oxidative stress within the macrophage milieu , mounted in the form of respiratory burst , under the inﬂuence of cytokines . 
Phagocytes use speciﬁc oxygen derived anti-microbial effector molecules in sequential fashion to inhibit or kill intracellular Salmonella ( Farr & Kogoma , 1991 ; Straaten et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , Salmonella is able to survive and proceed further to establish the infection ( Foster & Spector , 1995 ; Raupach & Kaufmann , 2001 ) . 
During the infection process , pathogens encounter various host stresses mounted in the form of oxidative stress conditions , relatively anaerobic conditions in gut , availability of nutrients , osmolarity variations , exposure to fatty acids and altered pH as well as temperature ( Chanana et al. , 2005 ) . 
In response to various stress conditions , the bacteria undergo several changes at the genetic and physiological level , which are referred to as stress responses . 
These stress responses can signiﬁcantly affect the survival capabilities of Salmonella in host environments and may enhance the virulence of the pathogen ( Spector , 1998 ; Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) . 
However , the interaction of Salmonella experiencing oxidative stress within the macrophage milieu and the status of chemically reactive micromolecules ( ROS , reactive oxygen species ) in this setup has not been looked into . 
Hence , it was considered worthwhile to investigate the potential of oxidative stressed Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) to induce apoptosis of peritoneal macrophages , which the pathogen may attempt to achieve immune avoidance . 
Materials and methods
Animals
Male inbred Balb/C mice , 4 -- 6 weeks old ( 16 -- 22 g in weight ) , used in the present study for extracting peritoneal macro-phages , were procured from the Central Animal House , Panjab University , Chandigarh , India . 
The care and use of animals was in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional ethical committee . 
Bacterial strain
The standard strain of S. Typhi ( Ty2 ) procured from Central Research Institute , Kasauli , India , was used in the present study . 
The strain was checked for purity and was characterized biochemically as well as serologically . 
The bacterial CFU mL was calculated for infection of the macrophages .

Growth conditions
Bacteria was grown on nutrient agar plates and single colonies were used to prepare the seed culture . 
Inoculum 0.1 % from seed culture was used to grow the bacteria under stress conditions . 
Oxidative stress
For the oxidative stress , S. Typhi cells were exposed to 15 mM L of hydrogen peroxide in accordance with the 1 method of Ozkanca et al. ( 2002 ) . 
The cells were grown in nutrient broth and hydrogen peroxide was added to the culture medium in the early logarithmic phase . 
The cells were allowed to grow at 37 1C , 400 g and were harvested in the early stationary phase . 
Isolation of peritoneal macrophages
For isolation of macrophages , Balb/C mice were injected with thioglycollate broth ( 2.5 mL per mouse given intraperitone-ally 4 days in advance ) as described by Chander et al. ( 2005 ) to achieve a better yield of macrophages . 
Macrophages were washed with RPMI 1640 ( ICN Biomedicals , Costa Mesa , CA ) at 4000 g for 10 min . 
Cell viability was checked with 0.2 % 6 1 Trypan blue staining . 
For interaction , 10 macrophages mL were infected with 10 bacteria ( for 6 h ) in a humidiﬁed 8 atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 at 37 1C . 
A macrophage : 6 8 bacteria ratio of 10 : 10 was chosen on the basis of multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) . 
MOI was determined to be 1 : 100 after standardization in our laboratory after assessing the macrophage viability determined by Trypan blue exclusion and macrophage cytotoxicity by measuring the release of host cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase ( data not shown ) . 
Assessment of nucleosomal DNA
DNA from cultured macrophages infected with S. Typhi ( oxidative-stressed and unstressed ) was isolated as described by Sambrook et al. ( 1998 ) . 
Brieﬂy , macrophages were harvested at 4000 g for 10 min . 
To the pellet , 500 mL of lysis buffer ( 0.2 M NaCl , 10 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris ) and 100 mL of 10 % SDS was added followed by the addition of Protei-nase K ( 10 mL of 20 mg mL 1 stock was used for 1 mL of cell suspension ) . 
This reaction mixture was incubated in a water bath at 56 1C overnight . 
After extraction with phenolcholoroform , the aqueous phase was transferred into the fresh vial and 10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate was added . 
1 Then 2.5 volumes of chilled 100 % ethanol were added and kept at 20 1C for 2 h for precipitation of DNA . 
After precipitation , the mix was centrifuged at 33 000 g for 10 min to obtain the DNA pellet . 
The pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol twice and the DNA then dried and dissolved in TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 ) at 37 1C for 2 h. DNA fragmentation was evaluated by electrophoresis using 1.8 % agarose gels . 
Acridine orange-ethidium bromide co-staining 
The staining procedure of Baker et al. ( 1994 ) was followed . 
Brieﬂy , after the incubation period the cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7.2 ) containing acridine orange ( 1 mg mL 1 ) and RNAse A ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) as well as the costaining with ethidium bromide ( Sigma ) in the same concentration ( Schwartz & Osborne , 1995 ) . 
The cells were then washed and examined under ﬂuorescence microscope ( 150 , Olympus , exciting ﬁlter BG12 , barrier ﬁlter 0 -- 5.30 ) . 
For quantiﬁcation of apoptotic cells , a total of 100 cells from three different slides were observed and the percentages of apoptotic cells calculated . 
FITC-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide staining
The ﬂipping of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane , which is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis , is assessed by its binding with FITC-labeled Annexin V ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) for detection of the apoptotic population ( Vermes et al. , 1995 ) . 
Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates , infected with bacteria and treated with stress induced protein as described earlier . 
After the incubation , cells were harvested using PBS10 .02 % EDTA , washed twice in PBS and suspended in 100 mL binding buffer ( 10 mM HEPES-NaOH , 
140 mM NaCl , 2.5 mM calcium chloride , pH 7.4 ) . 
Annexin V-FLOUS was added and cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark . 
After one wash , cells were re-suspended in 200 mL binding buffer and counterstained with 1 mg mL 1 propi-dium iodide for determination of permeable ( necrotic ) cells . 
A total of 10 000 cells per sample were analyzed with a Becton Dickinson ( San José , CA ) FACS Calibur equipped with a 15 mW , 488 nm air-cooled argon laser using CELLQUEST software . 
Estimation of malondialdehyde as an index of reactive oxygen species generation
The quantitative measurement of lipid peroxidation in the culture supernatants of macrophages was performed according to the method of Wills ( 1966 ) . 
The amount of malondialdehyde formed , a measure of lipid peroxidation , was assayed by the reaction with thiobarbituric acid . 
In brief , 0.5 mL of Tris-HCl buffer ( 0.1 M , pH 7.4 ) was added to 0.5 mL of culture supernatant and the mixture was incubated at 37 1C for 2 h. Following incubation , 1.0 mL of 10 % ( w/v ) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min . 
To 1.0 mL of supernatant ( obtained after centrifugation ) , 1.0 mL of 0.67 % ( w/v ) thiobarbituric acid was added and the mixture kept in a boiling water bath for 10 min . 
After cooling the tubes with tap water , 1.0 mL of distilled water was added and absorbance was measured at 532 nm . 
The results were expressed as nanomoles of malondialdehyde per milligram of protein , using the molar extinction co-efﬁcient of chromophore ( 1.56 10 M cm ) , for which the protein con-1 1 tent of tissue homogenates was calculated according to the method of Lowry et al. ( 1951 ) . 
Estimation of superoxide dismutase activity
Superoxide dismutase activity was assayed according to the method of Kono ( 1978 ) . 
The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mL hydroxylamine hydrochloride to the reaction mixture containing 2.0 mL of nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.1 mL of culture supernatant . 
Change in absorbance was measured spectrophotometerically at 560 nm . 
The activity was expressed as units of superoxide dismutase per milligram of protein where one unit of activity is deﬁned as the amount of superoxide dismutase required to inhibit the rate of reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium by 50 % . 
The result was calculated taking the superoxide dismutase inhibition of control as 100 % . 
Monokine assays
The cell-free culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time . 
The cytokine activity [ interleukin ( IL ) -1 a , IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) a ] in the culture supernatants was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using mouse cytokine ELISA kits ( Che-micon International Inc. , Temecula , CA ) according to manufacturer 's instructions . 
Brieﬂy , 96-well microtitre plates precoated with monoclonal antibodies generated against mouse IL-1a , IL-6 and TNF-a were used to capture the respective monokines produced in the culture supernatants of macrophages . 
The assays were visualized using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate for IL-1a and TNF-a . 
For IL-6 the assay was visualized using a goat anti-rabbit-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and an ensuing chromagenic substrate reaction . 
The ELISA was sensitive to 0.2 pg mL of the cytokines released .

Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of results was determined by using the unpaired Student 's t-test and two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with multiple comparisons . 
Data were considered significant at P o 0.05 . 
Results
Assessment of DNA ladder
The chromosomal DNA of macrophages infected with oxidative stressed S. Typhi was fragmented extensively into oligonucleosomes , clearly visible as a characteristic DNA ladder on agarose gels after 6 h ( Fig. 1 , lane 4 ) . 
However , this pattern was not detected at 4 h and 8 h postinfection of the macrophages . 
A single high molecular weight DNA band was observed in the control sample , in which the macrophages

Apoptosis is not in the biochemical repertoire of prokar-yotes , but as a control , S. Typhi bacteria were subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction of DNA and no low molecular weight DNA was observed ( Fig. 1 , lane 2 ) .

Acridine orange-ethidium bromide co-staining 
The acridine orange-ethidium bromide co-staining method has the ability to stain the nuclei of apoptotic and necrotic cells differentially . 
This is also a useful tool to discriminate normal cells from apoptotic cells . 
In this case , the macro-phages in the control sample were stained a moderate green ( Fig. 2 , panel A ) , the apoptotic cells were greenish yellow ( Fig. 2 , panel B ) and the necrotic cells were orange red ( Fig .

Although the apoptotic cells were observed with normal Salmonella ( 31 % 2.87 % at 6 h ) as well as with stressed Salmonella ( 47 % 3.97 % at 6 h ) , the number of apoptotic cells was found to be signiﬁcantly higher ( P o 0.05 ) when the macrophages were treated with stressed Salmonella . 
FITC-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide staining
Using FITC-labeled annexin V , the macrophage population treated with normal and oxidative stressed S. Typhi for 6 h showed 38 % and 51 % cells respectively as apoptotic ( Fig. 3 ) , in contrast to 3.0 % apoptotic cells in the control samples . 
The apoptotic cells were identiﬁed by ﬂipping phosphati-dylserine receptors on the outer leaﬂet of plasma membrane . 
The counterstaining with propidium iodide showed 6.0 % and 7.11 % necrotic cells , respectively , in macrophages treated with normal and oxidative stressed S. Typhi . 
Estimation of malondialdehyde as an index of reactive oxygen species
Infection of macrophages with oxidative stressed S. Typhi induced signiﬁcantly increased malondialdehyde levels in the mouse peritoneal macrophages compared with the macrophages infected with S. Typhi grown under normal conditions ( Fig. 4 ) .

Estimation of superoxide dismutase activity
Infection of macrophages with oxidative stressed S. Typhi induced a signiﬁcant ( P o 0.01 ) decrease in the activity of the antioxidant defense enzyme superoxide dismutase in the culture supernatants of macrophages in comparison to when the macrophages were infected with S. Typhi grown under normal conditions ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Monokine assays
Macrophages infected with S. Typhi grown under normal conditions caused the release of 98 pg mL , 150 pg mL 1 1 and 190 pg mL of IL-6 , IL-1 1 a and TNF-a , respectively , and the infection of macrophages with oxidative stressed S. Typhi resulted in the generation of 159 , 229 and 469 pg mL of IL-6 , Il-1 1 a and TNF-a , respectively ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Generation of these cytokines by oxidative stressed S. Typhi was found to be signiﬁcantly higher when macrophages were either infected with normal S. Typhi or left untreated ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Of the cytokines assayed , generation of TNF-a was found to be the highest ( P o 0.001 ) in macrophages infected

Role of tumour necrosis factor a in mediating bacteria-induced apoptosis
To evaluate the contribution of TNF-a in apoptosis , we determined whether TNF-a , produced as a part of the macrophage response to Salmonella infection , played a role in activating apoptosis after bacterial infection . 
Therefore , the apoptotic cells were again enumerated by acridine orange-ethidium bromide co-staining after blocking the TNF-a activity , using 20 mg mL 1 of anti-TNF-a antibodies 
treated with Salmonella typhi . 
( a ) Untreated cells show only 3 % of population as apoptotic 
( lower right chamber ) . 
( b ) Normal S. Typhi trea-ted cells show 32 % of population as apoptotic 
( lower right chamber ) . 
( c ) Oxidative stressed S. Typhi treated cells show 51 % of population as 
apoptotic ( lower right chamber ) . 
Upper right chamber shows necrotic population that was 
stained with both propidium iodide and annexin V . 
The percentage of necrotic cells in the 
macrophages treated with normal and oxidative stressed S. Typhi was 6 % and 7 % , respectively .

Discussion
After ingestion on reaching the intestine , Salmonella encounter the resident tissue macrophages . 
Once Salmonella invade macrophages , they replicate and produce cytotoxins within these host cells . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that Salmonella ssp . 
are capable of causing cytotoxic effects in macrophage cells of murine origin ( Ashkenazi et al. , 1988 ) , and these effects have been shown to be at least partly due to the induction of an apoptotic response by the Salmonellae ( Chen et al. , 1996 ; Monack et al. , 1997 ) . 
An increasing number of bacterial species including Salmonella have been reported to induce apoptosis in phagocytes ( Zychlinsky et al. , 1992 ; Monack et al. , 1996 , 1997 ; van der Velden et al. , 2000 ) to avoid being detected by the immune system . 
The widespread occurrence of apoptosis has provoked efforts aimed at deﬁning the cellular regulatory mechanisms and biochemical processes involved in this kind of cell death .

Since the behaviour of Salmonella differs under in vivo situations , there is a need to understand the outcome of Salmonella -- host interactions in the ever-changing environment of the host . 
Little is known about the induction of apoptosis under the different host environments including the oxidative stress experienced by the pathogen inside the macrophage milieu . 
In the present study the assessment of nucleosomal DNA , nuclear staining with Acridine orange-ethidium bromide dyes as well as ﬂow cytometric analysis indicated the occurrence of characteristic features of apoptosis . 
The signiﬁcantly increased number of apoptotic cells resulting from interaction with bacterial cells grown under oxidative stressed conditions may be due to the up-regula-tion or modiﬁcation of certain genes during the infection of macrophages with the pathogen under oxidative stress . 
It has been well documented that a number of genes including sox R/S , mar A and oxy R are expressed in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli under oxidative stress conditions ( Farr & Kogoma , 1991 ; Straaten et al. , 2004 ) . 
There is considerable evidence that oxidative stress leading to excessive ROS generation results in lipid peroxidation , which may contribute to cell - and tissue damage ( Beckman et al. , 1990 ) . 
The biological targets for these highly reactive oxygen species are DNA , RNA , proteins and lipids . 
Many workers have used malondialdehyde levels as an index of tissue damage as it is a stable product of oxidative attack of 
ROS on unsaturated fatty acids , which are essential components of cell membrane . 
In the present study , a signiﬁcant increase ( P o 0.01 ) in malondialdehyde levels in the lysate of macrophages infected with oxidative stressed S. Typhi was observed , indicating the severe oxidative damage of the infected macrophages . 
The results of the present study showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the level of superoxide dismutase in the lysate of macrophages following exposure to oxidative stressed S. Typhi . 
This suggests that down-regulation of superoxide dismutase may cause generation of superoxide radicals to induce apoptosis in the macrophages and has been reported to cause apoptotic cell death in neural cells ( Troy & Shelanski , 1994 ) . 
It was observed in an earlier study that E. coli cells lacking superoxide dismutase exhibit enhanced mutation rate during aerobic growth , supporting the concept of DNA damage as a result of absence of superoxide dismutase ( Farr et al. , 1986 ) . 
The signiﬁcant decrease ( P o 0.01 ) in superoxide dismutase levels observed in the present study might result in the hampered dismutation of superoxide anions and inefﬁcient detoxiﬁcation of H2O2 ( Granger et al. , 1986 ) . 
This in turn results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen intermediates of known apoptosis inducing abilities . 
Evidence that programmed cell death can be induced by oxidative stress is provided by studies in which mediators of programmed cell death either induce reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) , or can be inhibited by the addition of antioxidants . 
Tumour necrosis factor a is one example of such a mediator . 
Stimulation of the TNF receptor results in a rapid rise in the levels of intracellular ROI ( Larrick & Wright , 1990 ) and , in various cells , TNF-mediated programmed cell death can be inhibited either by thioredoxin ( Matsuda et al. , 1991 ) , an intracellular thiol reductant and free radical scavenger , or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) ( Chang et al. , 1992 ) , a thiol antioxidant and GSH precursor ( Droge et al. , 1992 ) . 
Tumour necrosis factor a , interferon ( IFN ) - a and IL-1 have also been reported to induce apoptosis in various cell types ( Ruggiero et al. , 1986 ; Abreu-Martin et al. , 1995 ; van Antwerp et al. , 1996 ) . 
Following Salmonella infection , TNF-a production is up-regulated ( Nishimura et al. , 1997 ) . 
In the present study , TNF-a mediated apoptosis is indicated with oxidative stressed Salmonella . 
These results concur with an earlier study in which cellular sensitivity or resistance to TNF-a was correlated with decreased or increased levels of superoxide dismutase , respectively ( Hir-ose et al. , 1993 ) . 
In the present study , when TNF-a activity in infected macrophage cultures was blocked with anti-TNF-a antibodies , the induction of apoptosis was partly blocked . 
These results are in accordance with the study reported by Kim et al. ( 1998 ) wherein a 20 % reduction in epithelial cell apoptosis by Salmonella dublin was observed . 
Superoxide dismutase-deﬁcient T cells have been shown to be more susceptible to killing by TNF , ionizing radiation and hyperthermia ( Wong et al. , 1991 ) . 
The results are suggestive of a central role of TNF-a in conjunction with IL-1a and IL-6 in inducing the apoptotic cell death of macrophages following Salmonella infection through up-regulation of ROS and down-regulation of anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase . 
This study highlights the host -- pathogen interactions under conditions closer to in vivo situations following Salmonella infection . 
Further studies need to address the identiﬁcation of microbial factors involved in the evolution and ultimate resolution of salmonellosis .
