Abstract
Invasion of Salmonella into intestinal epithelial cells is believed to be essential for the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections . 
Invasion is mediated by genes located on the Salmonella pathogenicity Island I ( SPI-1 ) , which are needed for assembling a type three secretion system , that mediates injection of bacterial proteins into the cytosol of epithelial cells , resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements and as a consequence invasion . 
HilA is the key regulator of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island I. To assess the role of hilA in colonization of gut and internal organs in poultry , animals were infected with 10 CFU of a DhilA mutant of S. 8 Enteritidis and its parent strain at day of hatch . 
Very low numbers of DhilA mutant strain were able to colonize the internal organs shortly after infection , but they were not eliminated from internal organs at 4 weeks post-infection . 
At that time , the colonization level of the wild type bacteria in internal organs was decreased to the same low level compared with DhilA mutant strain bacteria . 
Shedding of the DhilA mutant strain and colonization of the caeca was seriously decreased relative to the parent strain starting from Day 5 post-infection . 
At 4 weeks post-infection , the DhilA mutant strain was more or less eliminated from the chicken gut , while the parent strain was still shed to a high level and colonized the caeca to a high extent ( more than 10 CFU/g ) . 
It is 7 concluded that hilA is involved in long-term shedding and colonization of S. Enteritidis in the chicken caeca .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( S. Enteritidis ) is one of the leading causes of human food borne infections of bacterial origin and can be associated with consumption of chicken eggs and meat ( Guard-Petter ,

2001 ; Olsen et al. , 2001 ) . 
Infection of 1-day-old chickens with high doses of S. Enteritidis can be associated with the subsequent development of clinical salmonellosis with a high rate of mortality , while infection with low doses can result in the development of clinical healthy carrier animals ( Gast and Benson , 1995 ; Desmidt et al. , 1997 ; Van Immerseel et al. , 2004 ) . 
Infection of older chickens does not lead to clinical symptoms . 
In poultry , an important step in Salmonella pathogenesis is bacterial entry in the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract , especially the caeca ( Desmidt et al. , 1997 ) . 
Salmonella actively stimulates its own uptake into epithelial cells by inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane rufﬂing ( Finlay and Falkow , 1997 ) . 
These morphological changes are triggered by proteins secreted by Salmonella into the cytosol of the epithelial cells via a type III secretion system ( TTSS ) encoded by genes of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) ( Mills et al. , 1995 ; Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Zhou and Galan , 2001 ) . 
Several regulatory proteins that are involved in Salmonella invasion have been characterized ( Lucas and Lee , 2000 ) . 
The key regulator of SPI-1 is hilA , a transcriptional activator encoded on SPI-1 that regulates the expression of the SPI-1 secretion system as well as many of its secreted effectors ( Bajaj et al. , 1995 ) . 
HilA knock-out mutants are unable to enter epithelial cells in vitro ( Rakeman et al. , 1999 ; Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ; Galan , 1996 ) . 
Despite the numerous studies on regulation of hilA at the molecular level , studies of the effects of hilA expression on in vivo virulence are scarce ( Lichtensteiger and Vimr , 2003 ; Tsolis et al. , 1999 ; Morgan et al. , 2004 ) . 
Previous studies showed that after early infection in pigs , a hilA mutant of the host-adapted S. 
Cholerasuis failed to colonize the intestine and spleen early after oral infection in a signature-tagged mutagenesis ( STM ) experiment ( Lichtensteiger and Vimr , 2003 ) . 
Also in mice and calves it was shown that colonization of Peyers patches and spleen was reduced early after oral infection using the STM approach . 
SPI-1 mutants of S. Typhimurium LT2 , however , were still able to colonize tissues early after infection of young chicks ( Tsolis et al. , 1999 ; Morgan et al. , 2004 ) . 
Despite this , it is not known whether SPI-1 mutants are able to colonize chicken intestine or tissue in the long-term after oral infection . 
The present study was designed to evaluate the importance of hilA mutation on S. Enteritidis coloni-zation and shedding in chickens in a long-term experiment . 
A non-invasive S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant and its parent strain were orally administered to day-old chicks and shedding and organ colonization were monitored until 4 weeks of age . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strain
Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 4 , strain NIDO 76Sa88 Nal was used in the experiment . 
This strain r was isolated from an outbreak of salmonellosis at a poultry farm . 
The nalidixic acid resistant strain and its 76Sa88 wild type progenitor strain are well-char-acterized ( Desmidt et al. , 1997 , 1998 ; Van Immerseel et al. , 2002 ) . 
2.2. Construction of deﬁned mutant
A deletion mutant in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 encoded regulator HilA was constructed according to the one-step inactivation method , using a linear PCR product , ﬁrst described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the gene of interest was ﬁrst substituted by a PCR adjusted antibiotic resistance cassette ( kanamycin ) using the helper-plasmid pKD46 . 
This plasmid encode the l Red system , which promote recombination between the native gene and the PCR adjusted antibiotic resistance cassette . 
Recombinant clones were selected by plating on Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) agar containing 100 mg/ml kanamycin . 
The substitution was conﬁrmed by PCR . 
The mutant allele was subsequently P22-transduced in a fresh wild type S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 Nal backr ground . 
In the last step , the antibiotic resistance cassette was eliminated using the helper-plasmid 
Pcp20 . 
The targeted gene was completely deleted from the start codon till the stop codon . 
This was conﬁrmed by sequencing . 
2.3. Real time PCR
Normalized relative expression levels of the SPI-1 regulator hilA and the SPI-1 effector protein sipA were measured in the wild type Salmonella Enteritidis 76Sa88 strain and its DhilA mutant strain 
The strains were grown in LB at 37 8C while shaking at 150 rpm to an optical density of about 0.900 at 610 nm which corresponded with the late logarithmic growth phase . 
The bacterial plate counts were determined on trypticase soy agar ( TSA ) . 
Total RNA was extracted from 1 ml of the bacterial culture using the RNeasy Mini Kit and the RNAprotect Bacteria reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) followed by a DNase treatment . 
To quantify the expression of the genes of interest the method according to Botteldoorn et al. ( in press ) was used . 
For the real-time reaction 5 ml cDNA , 1 SYBR Green I master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) and 300 nM of each primer was used ( Table 1 ) . 
As control genes 16S rRNA , gmk and rpoD were used and the normalisation factor ( NF ) was calculated by using the GeNorm software ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ) . 
The relative expression was calculated as the ratio of the SPI-1 gene ( hilA or sipA ) expression relative to the expression of the three control genes . 
2.4. Bacterial infection of T84 and HD11 cell lines
Cells of the human colon carcinoma cell line T84 and chicken macrophage cell line HD11 were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates ( Greiner , Frickenhausen , Germany ) at a density of 10 cells/well in culture 5 medium ( DMEM + 10 % and 5 % fetal calf serum , respectively + 2 % L-glutamine , without antibiotics ) and grown overnight . 
The bacteria were grown for 20 h at 37 8C in 5 ml of Luria -- Bertani Broth on a shaker platform , subcultured 1:100 in fresh LB broth ( 5 ml ) , and grown to late-log phase ( 5 h ) at 37 8C without shaking . 
After 5 h of incubation at 37 8C , suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM with 10 % FCS ( fetal calf serum ) . 
The number of CFU/ml was determined by plating 6 20 ml of a dilution series of the suspensions on BGA ( Brilliant 
Green Agar , Oxoid , Basingstoke , England ) , where after the plates were incubated aerobically for 20 h at 37 8C . 
The suspensions were put at 4 8C until they were used in the assay . 
The bacterial suspensions were diluted in culture medium to a density of 5 10 6 CFU/ml . 
From these diluted suspensions , 200 ml was transferred to cells . 
This was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm to make close contact between the bacteria and the cells . 
The plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 8C and 5 % CO2 . 
The cells then were rinsed three times with Hanks ' Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS , Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) . 
Cell culture medium with gentamicin 50 and 20 mg/ml was added and plates were incubated for 1 h and 4 h at 37 8C and 5 % CO2 , respectively . 
Hereafter , the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and lysed with 0.2 % deoxycholic acid ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA ) for T84 cells and 
1 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA ) for HD11 cells in distilled water . 
From this lysate , a 10-fold dilution series was made . 
From each dilution , 6 20 ml was inoculated on BGA , to determine the number of CFU of S. Enteritidis per milliliter . 
Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance methods using SPSS 12.0 software . 
2.5 . 
LDH assay 
Cytotoxicity was assessed as a function of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release ( Cytotoxicity detection kit , Roche Diagnostic Corporation , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) of HD11 chicken macrophage cells . 
HD11 cells were seeded in 24-well cell culture plates ( Greiner , Frickenhausen , Germany ) at a density of 5 10 cells / 5 well in culture medium ( DMEM + 5 % fetal calf serum + 2 % L-glutamine , without antibiotics ) and grown overnight . 
The bacteria were grown to late-log phase ( 5 h ) at 37 8C without shaking and added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 500 ( CFU/cell ) . 
Then , the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 8C and 5 %

As a positive control with 100 % toxicity , cells were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 in cell culture medium for 10 min at 37 8C to obtain a representative maximal LDH release . 
As a negative control , the spontaneous release of LDH in untreated cells was assessed , which was signiﬁcantly higher than that of culture media alone . 
Cellular supernatant ( 50 ml ) was removed from each well and transferred to a 96-well plate to determine LDH release of the culture . 
Fifty microliter reconstituted substrate mix ( Roche Diagnostic Corporation , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) was added to each well and the OD units were measured on a microplate reader at 490 nm . 
The percentage of cytotoxicity was determined using the following formula , instructed by the Cytotoxicity detection kit ( Roche ) :

2.6 . 
Chickens 
Speciﬁc pathogen free ( SPF ) White Leghorn eggs ( Charles River Laboratories ) were hatched and housed in isolation . 
Before the start of the experiment cloacal swabs were taken from ﬁve chickens per group and checked for Salmonella , to conﬁrm that the animals were Salmonella-free . 
Also serum samples were taken from 25 chickens to detect maternal antibodies against Salmonella Enteritidis by means of an indirect ELISA , based on lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella Enteritidis ( Desmidt et al. , 1996 ) . 
Both tests gave negative results . 
Feed and drinking water was provided ad libitum . 
2.7 . 
In vivo trial 
The experimental protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Ghent University . 
One-day-old chicks were randomly divided in two groups of 39 and inoculated by oral route in the crop using a plastic tube with 10 8 colony forming units ( CFU ) of S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 Nal parent strain and S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant in a r volume of 0.2 ml of PBS . 
At Day 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 20 and 
28 post-hatch cloacal swabs were taken for the detection of Salmonella . 
Four chickens per group were euthanized at Day 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 20 and 28 post-hatch and samples of caeca , liver and spleen were taken for bacteriological analysis . 
2.8. Bacteriological analysis
Cloacal swabs were directly inoculated on BGA plates with 20 mg/ml nalidixic acid , which were incubated for 20 h at 37 8C . 
When negative after direct inoculation , samples were pre-enriched in buffered peptone water ( BPW , Oxoid , Basingstoke , England ) overnight at 37 8C , after which samples were enriched by addition of 1 ml of this suspension to 9 ml tetrathionate-brilliant green broth . 
After incubation overnight at 37 8C , a loopful of this suspension was plated on BGA . 
Samples of caeca , liver and spleen were homo-genised and 10-fold dilutions were made in buffered peptone water . 
For each dilution 6 20 ml were inoculated on BGA plates with 20 mg/ml nalidixic acid . 
After incubation overnight ( 37 8C ) the number of CFU/g tissue was determined by counting the bacterial colonies . 
For samples which were negative after titration , pre-enrichment and enrichment was performed , as described above . 
Samples that were negative after titration but positive after Salmonella enrichment were presumed to contain 10 CFU/g organ . 
Samples that were negative 1 after enrichment were presumed to have 0 CFU/g . 
The mean CFU/g tissue was calculated for each group . 
SPSS 12.0 software was used for statistical analysis . 
For each time point , logistic regression and general analysis of variance methods were used to determine signiﬁcant differences between treated groups for the cloacal swabs analysis and for analysis of the samples of caeca , liver and spleen , respectively . 
Differences with Pvalues below 0.05 were signiﬁcant . 
3. Results
3.1. Relative expression levels of SPI-1 related genes hilA and sipA
The relative expression of hilA for S. Enteritidis wild type strain was 5.816 , whereas no expression ha been detected in the DhilA mutant . 
SipA expression of the DhilA mutant strain was very low , a 219-fold decrease was observed in comparison with the wild type Salmonella Enteritidis 76Sa88 strain . 
3.2. Bacterial infection of T84 and HD11 cells
The relative invasion percentage ( invasion as a percentage of invasion of the parent strain ) of S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant in T84 cells was 0.04 % . 
The uptake of S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant by HD11 cells as a percentage of the uptake of the wild type strain was 0.28 % . 
The relative intramacrophage survival percen-tage ( 4 h/1 h ) of the DhilA mutant was 52 % of the wild type strain . 
All differences between the wild type strain and the DhilA mutant were statistically signiﬁcant .

3.3. LDH assay
The percentage of cytotoxicity 4 h post-infection of HD11 cells with the S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain was 65.50 % . 
For the DhilA mutant strain the cytotoxicity was 3.74 % . 
The results are calculated relative to triton-exposed cells ( 100 % ) . 
3.4. In vivo trial
Differences in clinical signs of disease were observed for both inoculated strains during the ﬁrst 2 weeks after infection . 
Birds infected with the parent strain S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 had severe diarrhoea with pasting of the vent . 
Furthermore , they showed lethargy with drooping of heads and wings and anorexia . 
Birds infected with the DhilA mutant strain showed no clinical signs . 
Mortality was observed up to 9 days after inoculation . 
Nine out of 39 birds ( 23 % ) died in the group infected with the S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain and 3 out of 39 chicks ( 7.7 % ) died in the group inoculated with the S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant strain . 
At necropsy the chicks infected with the parent strain presented swollen caeca with ﬁbrinous and necrotic material ﬁlling the lumen and covering the surface of the caecal wall . 
Chicks infected with the DhilA mutant showed no gross lesions . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , cloacal swabs taken 1 day after infection revealed that all animals were positive after direct plating for both inoculated groups . 
All chicks infected with S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain shed the bacteria in faeces throughout the study . 
The number of animals shedding the DhilA mutant bacteria in the faeces was signiﬁcantly lower compared with animals infected with the parent strain from Day 5 post-inoculation onwards . 
The chickens did not shed the DhilA strain anymore at 27 days post-inoculation . 
Bacteriological analysis of the caeca showed peak values of about log10 8 CFU/g organ at 2 days post-infection for both S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain and S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant ( Fig. 2 ) .

Each time point epresents four chicks , with exception of three chicks at Day 20 and 8 in the S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain infected group . 
F E li a r the numbers of the DhilA mutant bacteria in the caeca decreased over time . 
Statistically signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0.005 ) between both groups were observed from Day 5 following infection , with the exception of Day 8 post-infection . 
At 3 weeks post-infection , the parent strain still efﬁciently colonized the caeca ( ca . 
log10 6 CFU/g ) , whereas the birds infected with the DhilA mutant had largely cleared the infecting bacteria , as they were only detected after enrichment . 
At 27 days post-inoculation only two out of four chicks were positive at enrichment level . 
S. Enteritidis 76Sa88 parent strain peaked in internal organs at 2 days post-infection to reach about 10 CFU/g for spleen and 10 CFU/g for liver ( Fig. 2 ) . 
5 4 Subsequently , their number gradually decreased in time . 
Very low numbers of DhilA mutant bacteria were able to colonize the internal organs . 
No liver samples were positive at direct plating . 
At Day 2 post-infection , all liver samples were negative , while from Day 3 until Day 19 post-infection , all samples were positive at enrichment level . 
At Day 27 post-infection , two out of three liver samples were positive at enrichment level . 
Spleen samples that were positive at direct plating were only found at Day 5 and 14 post-infection , although the mean number of CFU/g was below 10 CFU/g . 
At Day 3 and 7 post-infection , all 2 samples were positive at enrichment level , while at Day 19 and 27 post-infection , three and two out of four animals had a positive spleen sample at enrichment level , respectively . 
At 28 days post-hatch , no statistically signiﬁcant differences could be detected anymore between the DhilA mutant bacteria and the wild type strain , due to systemic clearance of the parent strain bacteria . 
4. Discussion
The data presented here indicate that hilA is required for long-term shedding and caecal colonization of S. Enteritidis in chickens . 
Highly dosed infections of 1-day-old chicks with the wild type strain and its DhilA mutant resulted in an efﬁcient initial colonization of the caeca at a comparable level until 3 days post-infection . 
This result is in accordance with results of Morgan et al. ( 2004 ) , who did not see any difference between mutants in SPI-1 genes and the S. Typhimurium parent strain in the ability to colonize the caeca of chickens the ﬁrst days post-infection . 
Colonization of the S. Enteritidis DhilA mutant strain was decreased in the caeca starting from about 5 days post-infection . 
The difference with the wild type strain became more pronounced during time . 
Also faecal shedding decreased during time . 
In addition , very few DhilA bacteria were able to colonize the internal organs . 
Faecal shedding and colonization of caeca of the DhilA mutant strain went down to very low levels , approaching zero , at the end of the experiment at 4 weeks post-infection . 
Complementary with our data , Turner et al. ( 1998 ) have shown that the SipC protein is also involved in long-term shedding of Salmonella . 
Nonpolar mutations in sipC render S. Typhimurium incapable of entering cultured epithelial cells ( Kaniga et al. , 1995a , 1995b ) . 
In chickens , the main colonization site for Salmonella are the caeca ( Desmidt et al. , 1997 ) . 
At this site , individual and groups of Salmonella bacteria lying free within the cytoplasm and in membrane-bound vesicles of caecal epithelial cells , as well as in the extracellular space in the lamina propria , have been detected by electron microscopy ( Desmidt et al. , 1998 ; Popiel and Turnbull , 1985 ) . 
Salmonella Enteritidis wild type strain bacteria can extensively multiply in isolated primary caecal epithelial cells from chickens ( unpublished data ) . 
The spontaneous desquamation of chicken epithelial cells occurs within 4 days ( Takeuchi et al. , 1998 ) . 
As a hypothesis , it can be speculated that Salmonella bacteria multiply intracellularly in the epithelial cells of the caeca , being released subsequently into the lumen after death of the epithelial cells ( either by spontaneous desquamation or bacterial cytotoxicity ) . 
This may partly explain the strong reduction in long-term caecal colonization and faecal shedding of the DhilA mutant bacteria observed in the present study . 
Another possible explanation is that the DhilA mutant bacteria , besides the reduced uptake by macrophages , are not capable to induce macrophage cell death , resulting in a faster host clearance ( e.g. in the intestinal wall ) . 
There has been indicated that there is a close correlation between the mechanisms of bacterial internalization into non-phagocytic cells and macrophages and those that lead to murine macro-phage apoptosis induced by S. Typhimurium ( Monack et al. , 1996 ; Hersh et al. , 1999 ; Guiney , 2005 ) . 
It is suggested that hilA additionally regulates genes in th pathogenicity island SPI-4 ( Ahmer et al. , 1999 ; De Keersmaecker et al. , 2005 ) , which has originally been described by Wong et al. ( 1998 ) as needed for intramacrophage survival . 
Our data did conﬁrm a contribution of hilA on the uptake by macrophages , the induction of cell death in chicken phagocytes and the intramacrophage survival of Salmonella . 
The possibility that macrophage cell death may be involved in the phenomena observed in the present study has to be considered . 
In our study , the DhilA mutant strain was still able to colonize the internal organs . 
Although the level of colonization was much lower compared with the wild type strain bacteria the ﬁrst weeks post-infection , similar ( low ) levels of colonization were observed at 28 days post-infection . 
Different explanations can be given for the colonization of the systemic sites by the 
DhilA mutant strain in our experiment . 
First , it is suggested that additional mechanisms for invasion may exist in Salmonella ( Murray and Lee , 2000 ; Stone et al. , 1992 ; Clark et al. , 1996 ; Rakeman et al. , 1999 ; Vazquez-Torres et al. , 1999 ) . 
Rakeman et al. ( 1999 ) postulated a hilA independent activation of invF expression in S. Typhimurium which could be important for the assembly of the TTSS apparatus components . 
Hong and Miller ( 1998 ) showed that sigD is part of an invasion mechanism operating independent of invA . 
In our study , low expression levels of the SPI-1 effector protein sipA were measured in the absence of hilA expression , indeed illustrating the presence of hilA-independent invasion mechanisms . 
Secondly , systemic sites can be reached by involvement of phagocytes , carrying the bacteria from the intestine to the bloodstream . 
It has been shown that , in absence of SPI-1 mediated enteric colonization , murine CD18-expressing phagocytes may take up Salmonella from the intestine and ﬁnally cause systemic infection in mice ( Vazquez-Torres et al. , 1999 ) . 
Chicken macrophages , containing bacteria not sequestered in lysosomal vesicles , traversing breaks in the basement membrane from the caecal epithelium to the lamina propria , have been observed in electron microscopy studies ( Popiel and Turnbull , 1985 ) . 
Whether and to which extent one of these mechanisms plays a role in systemic spread and colonization of internal organs by the DhilA mutant ( and the wild type ) strain in the chicken model is unclear . 
Taking together all available data on the virulence of DhilA mutant Salmonella in chickens , it appears that these bacteria can colonize the caeca early post-infection , but have a seriously reduced ability to continue colonizing the caeca starting about a week post-infection onwards . 
HilA mutant bacteria were decreased in the ability to colonize the internal organs early post-infection , but were not completely eliminated from these organs at 4 weeks post-infection . 
HilA is thus involved in long-term colonization of the caeca by Salmonella in chickens . 
The relative contribution of the interactions with epithelial cells and macrophages , leading to the attenuated phenotype are yet unclear .
