Objective To prepare the live recombinant vaccine of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 expressing Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) B subunit ( UreB ) and to determine whether it could be used as an oral vaccine against H. pylori infection . 
Methods Using genomic DNA of H. pylori Sydney strain ( SS1 ) as template , the H. pylori UreB gene fragment was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the expression vector pTC01 . 
The recombinant plasmid pTC01-UreB was then transferred into LB5000 to obtain modified forms , and further conversed into the attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 to obtain recombinant SL3261/pCT01-UreB as an oral immunization reagent , which was then used to orally immunize Balb/c mice twice at a three-week interval . 
Twelve weeks later , anti-UreB IgA antibodies in intestinal fluid and IgG antibodies in sera were determined by ELISA . 
The relating data in control groups ( including body weight , gastric inflammation , etc. ) were also collected . 
Results The sequencing analysis showed that the UreB gene fragment amplified by PCR was consistent with the sequence of the H. pylori UreB gene . 
The restriction enzyme digestion revealed that the correct pTC01-UreB was obtained . 
SDS-PAGE and Western blot showed that a 61KD protein was expressed in SL3261/pTC01-UreB , which could be recognized by anti-H . 
pylori UreB antiserum and was absent in the control containing only Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 strain . 
The multiple oral immunization with SL3261/pTC01-UreB could significantly induce H. pylori specific mucosal IgA response as well as serum IgG responses .

INTRODUCTION
H. pylori is one of the most pandemic bacteria in human beings and has been identified as the chief pathogen for chronic gastritis , peptic gastric ulcer and some kinds of carcinoma of epithelial tissue in gastric mucosa . 
Fortunately , related studies for the time being unanimously suggest that the vaccine of H. pylori might become the most effective method in the treatment and prevention of H. pylori infection worldwide [ 1 ] . 
Most H. pylori vaccine studies have been focused on the protein vaccine , including studies on the extracts of whole H. pylori ultrasonic grinding and screening of H. pylori structural antigen . 
Since the preparation and purification of protein antigen are costly and time consumed , it is extremely necessary to develop novel vaccines against H. pylori infection . 
Because protein can be easily degraded in gastrointestinal tract , adjuvants such as Vibrio comma CT and Bacillus coli Lt are usually added to induce effective and protective immunoreactions [ 2 ] . 
While the body is immunized with protein vaccine , it suffers from various side effects caused by adjuvants . 
Urease is considered as the best candidate antigen for the vaccine preparation of H. pylori so far since urease is an inactive structural protein and indispensable in the implantation process of H. pylori into gastric mucosa [ 3 ] . 
A lot of studies showed that oral immunization in both animals and human beings with either native or recombinant H. pylori urease B subunit ( UreB ) can successfully induce protective immunoreactions against H. pylori infection [ 4-6 ] . 
Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 is an engineered bacterium with mutational gene of aromatic amino acid-related gene ( aroA gene ) . 
It could be used as an ideal vector due to its advantages of having invasiveness but without pathogenicity of Salmonella . 
It also has ability to induce effective and protective immunoreactions in gastric mucosa without degradation and damage in the gastrointestinal tract when orally administrated . 
In the study , we immunized Balb/c mice with the live recombinant vaccine of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 expressing H. pylori UreB , tested anti-UreB antibodies , cytokines of INF-γ and IL-10 , and index of gastric mucosal inflammation , and then determined whether attenuated SL3261 / pTC01-UreB could be used as an oral vaccine against H. pylori infection .

H. pylori Cultivation of Gastric Tissue
A few clones ( 40 to 60 c.f.u ) on selective culture media were observed and identified as H. pylori by both urease test and Giemsa stain in the PBS and SL3261 control groups , which were 60 % ( 3/5 ) and 40 % ( 2/5 ) , respectively . 
There was no H. pylori colony in gastric mucosa tissue of Balb/c mice in the experimental group . 
DISCUSSION
H. pylori is the chief pathogen for chronic gastritis and peptic gastric ulcer , and is closely related to carcinoma of stomach and lymphoma of MALT [ 1 ] . 
Incidence of H. pylori infection and carcinoma of stomach are relatively higher in China . 
UreB is now widely regarded as a promising candidate antigen for vaccine production . 
Moreover , UreB has a strong immunogenicity [ 2-3 ] . 
Urease is composed of nine subunits , while UreB and UreA are two vital subunits of urease . 
UreB and UreA are located in cytoplasm and on the surface of membrane . 
Immunogenicity of UreB is much stronger than that of UreA [ 5 ] . 
Experiments on mice and primate animals showed that both native and recombinant protein with adjuvant stimulated immunological protection against H. pylori infection [ 6 ] . 
The immunization lasted for a long time and had no side effect . 
Attenuated vaccines of UreB protein have entered the second stage of clinical trial [ 9-10 ] . 
H. pylori SS1 used in this study fit well to the pathogenic studies due to its positive CagA and VacA , strong pathogenicity and easy implantation . 
According to the sequence of Urease gene [ 9 ] , we developed a couple of PCR primers of UreB and a gene segment was amplified from H. pylori SS1 genome . 
Sequencing showed that the segment was identical with H. pylori UreB gene . 
The segment was cloned into expression vector pTC01 , laying a foundation for the development of attenuated oral vaccines of Salmonella typhimurium expressing H. pylori UreB . 
Compared with conventional vaccine types , attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a vaccine vector has the following advantages . 
Firstly , it is unnecessary to be purified and adjuvanted to the antigen . 
Oral immunization is safe and easy to conduct without inducing immunological endurance . 
Secondly , it can avoid the degradation and degeneration of antigen in gastrointestinal tract . 
Thirdly , it can induce long-lasting immunologic reaction in mucosa for its strong pathogenicity to the gastrointestinal tract [ 10-15 ] . 
Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 is an engineered bacterium with mutational gene of aromatic amino acid-related gene ( aroA gene ) . 
SL3261/pTC01-UreB , an attenuated vaccine of Salmonella typhimurium expressing H. pylori UreB , was successfully developed . 
Stable expression of gene of protective antigen in attenuated Salmonella typhimurium for a long-term period of time plays a key role in successful development of the vaccine . 
No pTC01-UreB plasmid was found in SL3261/pTC01-UreB cultured for 80 generations in succession on LB plates with chloramphenicol resistance . 
UreB protein expression was observed a different growth stages , suggesting that pTC01-UreB expression vector is stably hosted in SL3261 without toxicity . 
Expressed UreB protein was proved to have immunogenicity by Western blot using anti-H . 
pylori rabbit serum , suggesting that attenuated SL3261 / pTC01-UreB can be used as an oral vaccine against infection . 
Successful vaccine against gastrointestinal tract pathogens mainly relies on the induction of mucosal and systematic immunizations . 
Experimental Balb/c mice in the study were immunized with SL3261/pTC01-UreB . 
Twelve weeks later , specific anti-UreB antibodies IgA and IgG were detected in mouse intestinal fluid and serum . 
The levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 in the supernatant of splenocyte culture increased , suggesting that immunological reactions in mucosa , body fluid and cells can be induced . 
The present study showed that the vaccine was effective . 
It is now widely accepted that the goal of developing vaccines is to adjust immunological reactions from Th1 to Th2 [ 19-20 ] . 
It was reported that the protection of vaccine against H. pylori infection is closely related to the increase of Th2 reaction and decrease of Th1 reaction [ 20 ] . 
Our result showed that the secretion of IL-10 in immunized animals was elevated to a much higher level compared with the control , indicating that Th2 reaction was increased . 
The increased level of IFN-γ showed that there was also an increase of reaction Th1 . 
Since IFN-γ was also raised in the SL3261 control , the increase of reaction Th1 might be related to the adoption of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a vaccine vector because attenuated Salmonella typhimurium could induce strong Th1 [ 5 ] reaction . 
People are much concerned with the safety of vaccine . 
In our study , although most mice lost their weight to some extent during immunization , there was no significant difference compared with the control groups . 
In addition , no death or side effect as diarrhea were observed , and there was no inflammatory change in mice stomach . 
Therefore , it may be concluded that the vaccine is safe to immunize animals . 
Whether the development of vaccine is successful should be confirmed by experimental animal models . 
We used Balb/c mice as the animal model infected with SS1 repeatedly and found that it was an ideal one . 
No H. pylori growth was observed on the gastric tissue slices in all three groups . 
Although H. pylori on some mice gastric tissues of the control groups was incubated , the relatively small amount could not prove that the absence of H. pylori in the experimental group was caused by the immunization of SL3261/pTC01-UreB . 
Infiltration of inflammatory cells in gastric mucosa of experimental mice was fewer than that in the two control groups , showing no significant difference . 
There might be two reasons . 
Firstly , SS1 is human originated so that it can not be easily reproduced in mice and its pathogenicity declines after generations of incubation . 
Secondly , the experimental conditions at present can not meet the requirements of H. pylori incubation and the construction of animal model requires H. pylori with high activity . 
As for the absence of positive H. pylori in pathological examinations , it might be due to the small amount of H. pylori and their low sensitivity to staining . 
Giemsa stain is not the best and most sensitive method for H. pylori detection compared with silver staining . 
To set up better animal models as cat spirillum infected mice for the observation of SL3261/pTC01-UreB immunization is the goal of our further study .
