Abstract 
To establish whether the species-speciﬁc variations at the subunit interface of bacterial Cu , Zn superoxide dismutases affect dimer assembly , the association state of the Photobacterium leiognathi ( PlSOD ) and Salmonella typhimurium ( StSOD ) enzymes , which differ in 11 out of 19 interface residues , was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation . 
The same linkage pattern correlates quaternary assembly , active site metallation , and pH in the two enzymes albeit with quantitative differences . 
Both holo-enzymes are stable dimers at pH 6.8 and 8.0 , although their shape is altered at alkaline pH. In contrast , dimer stability is affected differently by metal removal . 
Thus , apo-StSOD is a stable dimer at pH 6.8 whereas apo-PlSOD is in reversible mono-mer -- dimer equilibrium . 
In both apoproteins a pH increase to 8.0 favors monomerization . 
These effects prove the existence of long-range communication between the active site and the subunit interface and provide a structural explanation for the known functional differences between the two enzymes .

The recent characterization of an increasing number of prokaryotic Cu , Zn superoxide dismutases ( Cu , Zn SODs ) 1 has revealed a considerable structural variability between proteins from different bacteria and distinctive structural features with respect to the eukaryotic enzymes . 
All bacterial Cu , Zn SODs conserve the characteristic fold based on a ﬂattened Greek-key eight-stranded b-barrel , but the organization of their active site channel and the quaternary structure are distinct . 
In particular , in prokaryotic Cu , Zn SODs the catalytically relevant residues involved in the electrostatic recognition and steering of the superoxide

anion have a different location in the folded monomer than in eukaryotes [ 1 ] such that the active site is surrounded by a rather ﬂexible protein environment and is more accessible to solvent [ 2,3 ] . 
Moreover , whereas eukaryotic Cu , Zn SODs are always homodimers , highly active and stable monomeric enzymes have been identiﬁed in Escherichia coli [ 4 ] , Brucella abortus [ 5 ] and Salmonella enterica [ 6 ] . 
Other bacterial Cu , Zn SODs are dimeric , although their state of association in solution has not been characterized rigorously . 
The crystallographic characterization of the enzymes from Photobacterium leiognathi [ 2,3 ] , Actinobacillus pleuro-pneumoniae [ 7 ] and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( here after referred to as S. typhimurium ) SodC1 [ 8 ] has brought out that the subunit interface is built from different structural elements and is characterized by looser intermo-lecular contacts relative to eukaryotic Cu , Zn SODs . 
Moreover , the bacterial interface deﬁnes a wide intermolecula cavity containing several ordered water molecules , at variance with the eukaryotic one where the tightly complementary surfaces exclude solvent . 
The interface of the P. leiognathi enzyme ( PlSOD ) can be taken as reference , since PlSOD was the ﬁrst Cu , Zn SOD to be isolated from a prokaryote [ 9 ] and to be crystallized [ 3 ] . 
The residues stabilizing the interface form three clusters . 
The ﬁrst is centered around the side-chains of Trp83 and Phe81 which form a wide hydrophobic patch involving several residues from the facing subunit , the second is built in proximity of the 2-fold axis by the side-chains of Met41 and Phe96 from both subunits , and the third comprises Lys25 , Tyr26 from one subunit and Asp85 from the symmetry-related one . 
Additional stability is provided by other residues , like Ala94 , Asp129 and His131 , whose surface is only marginally involved in the interaction with the partner subunit ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The numerous and radical mutations at these clusters occurring in the E. coli enzyme ( e.g. , Lys25?Asp , Tyr26?Lys , Phe81?Gly , Trp83?Glu , Met41?Glu ) account for its monomeric state , but it is not known , for example , whether the substantial number of substitutions characterizing S. typhimurium SodC1 ( StSOD ) results in a different dimerization capacity in solution relative to PlSOD . 
In StSOD , the most eficient superoxide dismutase known to date , the mutations concern 11 out of 19 interacting residues and are located mainly in the ﬁrst and second cluster ( Fig. 1A ) . 
It is hard to establish a priori whether the loss and/or the replacement of such a large number of interactions , the slightly larger molecular surface buried at the interface ( 805 Å vs. 754 Å in PlSOD ) and the smaller 2 2 number of ordered interface water molecules ( 5 -- 6 per dimer vs. 8 -- 10 in PlSOD ) result in an increased or decreased interface stability with respect to PlSOD . 
It is also not known whether and how far the metal cofactor inﬂuences the association state in solution . 
The existence of a sort of allosteric link between the interface and the active site has been suggested by previous studies on sitespeciﬁc PlSOD mutants bearing substitutions at the dimer interface . 
These mutants have an altered copper accessibility and reactivity and in addition are characterized by the onset of a metal-dependent subunit association -- dissociation process [ 10 -- 13 ] . 
Intriguingly , mutations at the subunit interface ( i.e. , Ala4?Val ) have been reported recently to affect metal afinity also in a human Cu , Zn SOD mutant .

Zn ( II ) is decreased despite its location at about 23 Å from the site of mutation [ 14 ] . 
A further linkage exists between quaternary structure and active site afinity for copper with pH that is evidenced by the decreased metal afinity and enhanced sensitivity to proteolytic attack in PlSOD and StSOD upon a pH shift from 6.8 to 8.0 [ 15 ] . 
However , it has not been established whether the underlying structural change is a localized one or involves destabilization of the subunit interface . 
To address the existence of long-range communication between the active site and the subunit interface , the pres-ent study compares the association behavior of two representative enzymes , PlSOD and StSOD , and focusses on the effect of the metal cofactor and of pH in the stabilization of the dimer interface . 
The enzymes from P. leiognathi and S. typhimurium were chosen for different reasons . 
PlSOD can be taken as the prototype of bacterial Cu , Zn SODs ; it has been the object of a large number of investigations that characterized its stability , catalytic and dynamical properties through different experimental approaches . 
StSOD , an important virulence factor in Salmonella [ 16,17 ] , has a role in pathogenesis that is clearly related to its speciﬁc biochemical properties . 
Thus , it can not be replaced eficiently by monomeric Cu , Zn SODs as established in recent in vivo studies [ 18,19 ] . 
Furthermore , StSOD is characterized by a much higher metal afinity and protease resistance in vitro than PlSOD and other dimeric Cu , Zn SODs from prokaryotes [ 15 ] . 
The results obtained provide a structural framework on which the modulation of dimer stability by the active site metals and pH can be explained . 
Materials and methods
Protein preparation
Recombinant PlSOD and StSOD were puriﬁed to homogeneity ( > 98 % , as judged by SDS -- PAGE analysis ) as described previously [ 11,8 ] . 
StSOD has a very high afinity for the copper ion such that the procedures described by Battistoni et al. [ 25 ] and D'Orazio et al. [ 10 ] to obtain apo-StSOD lacking both the copper and zinc ions do not warrant full demetallation . 
To achieve complete copper removal from the two enzymes , StSOD and PlSOD were treated with potassium ferrocyanide to reduce the metal and were dialyzed for 12 h against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , 50 mM KCN , pH 6.0 [ 20 ] . 
Subsequently , the copper-free enzymes were extensively dialyzed against phosphate buffer to eliminate KCN . 
The zinc ion was removed by dialysis against 100 mM acetate buffer , pH 3.8 , 2 mM EDTA , following established procedures [ 20 ] . 
The metal content of apo-StSOD was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using the Perkin Elmer spectrometer AAnalyst 300 equipped with the graphite furnace HGA-800 . 
Copper and zinc saturation of the available active sites was below 2 % . 
Samples for analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.8 or 8.0 , containing 0.2 mM EDTA . 
Their concentration was evaluated according to Lowry et al. [ 21 ] , using bovine serum albumin as a standard . 
Analytical ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were carried out at 10 C on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge , equipped with absorbance optics and an An60-Ti rotor . 
The protein concentration varied between 0.5 and 2 mg/mL [ 30 -- 120 lM on a monomer basis ] . 
The buffer was 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.8 or 8.0 ; in the experiments involving the apoprotein , 0.2 mM EDTA was present . 
Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 40,000 rpm . 
Data were collected at 275 nm and at a spacing of 0.003 cm with three averages in a continuous scan mode . 
Sedimentation coeficients were obtained with the software Sedﬁt ( provided by Dr. P. Schuck , National Institutes of Health ) . 
The values were reduced to water and 20 C ( s20 , w ) using standard procedures . 
The buffer density and viscosity were calculated by the software Sednterp . 
The ratio f/f0 was calculated from the diffusion coeficient , which in turn is related to the spreading of the boundary , using the program Sedﬁt . 
The Stokes radius ( RS ) was calculated from the sedimentation coeficient by means of the Siegel and Monty equation , namely S = M ( 1 V2 q ) / N0 ( 6pgRS ) . 
Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 30,000 and 35,000 rpm . 
Data were collected every 3 h at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 10 averages in a step scan mode . 
Equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h by the software Winmatch . 
Data sets were edited by REEDIT ( J. Lary , National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center , Storrs , CT ) and analyzed by the software Sedphat , provided by the National Institutes of Health . 
Data from different speeds were combined for global ﬁtting . 
The goodness of the ﬁt was judged using a combination of the ﬁt statistics ( data not shown ) and the randomness of residuals . 
When a monomer -- dimer association model was required for data ﬁtting , the monomer molecular weight was ﬁxed at the value determined from the amino acid sequence ( 15,760 Da ) . 
Results
The quaternary assembly of the apo - and metal-bound forms of PlSOD and StSOD at pH 6.8 and 8.0 and at 10 C has been characterized rigorously by analytical ultracentrifugation using combined sedimentation velocity and equilibrium approaches . 
In a ﬁrst set of experiments the metal-bound forms of the two proteins were analyzed by sedimentation velocity . 
PlSOD at pH 6.8 sediments as a single symmetrical peak characterized by a sedimentation coeficient , s20 , w , of 3.08 S , the value expected for a Cu , Zn SOD dimer endowed with a spherical shape . 
At pH 8.0 , the sedimentation velocity decreases to s20 , w = 2.15 S ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The behavior of metal-bound StSOD closely resembles that of PlSOD : the s20 , w value is 2.90 S at pH 6.8 and decreases to 2.30 S at pH 8.0 ( Fig. 3A ) . 
In principle , the observed decrease in sedimentation velocity observed at pH 8.0 can be due to a marked change in shape and/or to the establishment of a rapidly reversible monomer -- dimer association -- dissociation equilibrium . 
Although the increase in Stokes radius and frictional coef-ﬁcient ( Table 1 ) points to the occurrence of a signiﬁcant conformational change , the quaternary assembly was characterized using a thermodynamic approach . 
The sedimentation equilibrium experiments presented in Figs. 2C and 3C were performed at the same pH values and temperature as the velocity ones . 
The Mw values of both metal-bound Cu , Zn SODs under study ( 30,200 -- 31,000 Da ) prove that they are dimeric over the pH range analyzed . 
It follows that an increased frictional coeficient is at the basis of the decrease in sedimentation velocity manifest at pH 8.0 . 
In a second set of experiments the possible effect of the metal cofactor on dimer stability was analyzed . 
Sedimenta tion velocity and equilibrium experiments were performed on the apo form of the two proteins under the same conditions of pH and temperature used for the holo-enzymes . 
At pH 6.8 , the sedimentation velocity patterns of the apoproteins show a single peak centered at s20 , w = 2.10 S in the case of apo-PlSOD and at s20 , w = 2.90 S for apo-StSOD ( Figs. 2B and 3B ) , while sedimentation equilibrium experiments yield Mw values of 26,000 Da for apo-PlSOD and of 31,500 Da for apo-StSOD , respectively ( Figs. 2D and 3D ) . 
Thus , in contrast to the metal-bound proteins , only apo-StSOD is a stable dimer at pH 6.8 , whereas apo-PlSOD undergoes a rapidly reversible dissociation into monomers [ K1 ,2 = ( 6.80 ± 0.25 ) 10 M ] . 
5 1 At pH 8.0 ( Fig. 2B and D ) , apo-PlSOD is characterized by lower sedimentation velocity ( s20 , w = 1.90 S ) and Mw values ( 22,300 Da ) than at pH 6.8 indicative of an increased dissociation into monomers [ K1 ,2 = ( 3.00 ± 0.35 ) 10 M ] . 
Alkaline pH exerts a dissociating effect also 5 1 on apo-StSOD as shown by the decreased sedimentation velocity ( s20 , w = 2.20 S ) and Mw values ( 28,000 Da ) , corresponding to K1 ,2 = ( 1.30 ± 0.15 ) 10 M , relative to pH 6 1 6.8 ( Fig. 3B and D )

Discussion
In prokaryotic Cu , Zn SODs a complex linkage is known to exist between interface stability , active site occupancy with metals and pH. However , a quantitative assessment of the correlations linking these three features had not been undertaken despite numerous studies on the structural and functional properties of this class of enzymes . 
The present characterization of the association behavior of PlSOD and 
StSOD provides an assessment of the stabilizing effect of active site metals on the subunit interface and thereby substantiates the available evidence that metal binding has long-range effects on the enzyme structure . 
PlSOD and StSOD are dimeric in the crystalline state and display signiﬁcant differences in the subunit interface organization . 
In solution , the P. leiognathi and S. typhimu-rium holo-enzymes are dimeric at both pH 6.8 and 8.0 although sedimentation velocity studies reveal the occurrence of a signiﬁcant change in shape at the higher pH value ( Figs. 2A and 3A ) . 
The conformational change can be expressed as an increase of the Stokes radius , RS , fro 
25.8 to 32.6 Å for StSOD and from 24.3 to 34.8 Å for PlSOD . 
The frictional coeficient , f/f0 , concomitantly increases from 1.21 , the value pertaining to both proteins at pH 6.8 , to 1.68 for StSOD and 2.24 for PlSOD , respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
It is worth recalling that the f0 value does not take into account water of hydration such that no protein has experimental f/f0 values lower than 1.15 . 
Available f/f0 values calculated from sedimentation velocity data for globular proteins or proteins like ovalbumin whose shape and dimensions ( 70 36 30 Å ) are quite close to those of holo-PlSOD ( 60.6 30.6 33.2 Å ) correspond to 1.2 -- 1.3 [ 22 ] in agreement with those reported in Table 1 . 
It is of interest that the pH-linked conformational change is less marked in holo-StSOD than in holo-PlSOD in accordance with the higher resistance of the former enzyme towards proteolytic attack at pH 8.0 [ 15 ] . 
Removal of copper and zinc from the active site deeply inﬂuences subunit association albeit to a different extent in the two enzymes . 
Apo-PlSOD undergoes a rapidly revers-ible monomer -- dimer equilibrium over the whole pH range analyzed with alkaline pH favoring dissociation . 
Thus , the monomer -- dimer association constant , K1 ,2 , is ( 0.80 ± 0.25 ) 10 M at pH 6.8 and ( 3 ± 0.35 ) 10 M at pH 8.0 . 
In 6 1 5 1 apo-StSOD the dimeric structure is stable at pH 6.8 ( Mw 31,500 Da ) , but undergoes signiﬁcant dissociation into monomers at pH 8.0 where the K1 ,2 value corresponds to ( 1.30 ± 0.15 ) 10 M ( Figs. 2 , 3B and D ; Table 1 ) . 
These 6 1 ﬁndings prove the existence of long-range communication between the active site and the dimer interface . 
However , the effect of the active site metallation on PlSOD dimer stability can be attributed at least in part to a local effect , since all the zinc ligands are in a protein loop containing several residues involved in hydrophobic ( Phe81 , Trp83 ) or hydrogen bonding interactions ( Asp85 ) at the subunit interface . 
Due to the Phe81?Gly and the conservative Trp83?Tyr substitutions , this protein region shows slight modiﬁcations in StSOD . 
The ﬁrst evidence of the linkage between active site occupancy with metals and quaternary structure in this class of enzymes was provided by the observation that site-speciﬁc mutations of residues in each of the three clusters of PlSOD are crucial for dimer stability [ 10 -- 12,23 ] . 
These PlSOD mutants were found to be stable dimers in their holo-form , but to dissociate into monomers in the apo-form . 
Monomer formation was demonstrated by gel ﬁltration [ 10,11,23 ] , dissociation at high pressures [ 12 ] and by means of spectroscopic and molecular dynamics simulation analyses [ 13 ] . 
In very good agreement with the present ﬁndings , pressure-dependent dissociation was shown to take place also in wild type PlSOD when metal-depleted , but not in the holo-enzyme [ 12 ] . 
Qualitatively the tendency to dissociate into monomers after depletion of the active site metals is similar in PlSOD and StSOD , but the latter enzyme is characterized by a more stable quaternary structure . 
The two enzymes differ in several of the properties that are affected by speciﬁc mutations at the dimer interface , including catalytic rate , copper accessibility and metal afinity [ 8,15 ] . 
In view of the fact that substitution of single amino acids in different positions of the dimer interface can modify copper reactivity and accessibility signiﬁcantly [ 10 -- 12,23 ] , it is tempting to speculate that the observed functional differences may depend at least in part on the structural differences at the dimer interface of StSOD and PlSOD . 
As mentioned in the introduction , comparison of the crystal structure of the two enzymes brings out that such differences include a modiﬁcation of the contact area , 11 amino acids substitutions and a different number and orientation of the water molecules that ﬁll the interface cavity . 
In the absence of a structural model for bacterial apo-SODs , it is dificult to predict the role of any given difference in modulating the stability of the quaternary structure . 
However , although several substitutions of the interface residues are conservative , some mutations might inﬂuence dimer stability significantly . 
For example , the Lys25?Pro mutation likely destabilizes the StSOD dimer since it abolishes the intersubunit Lys25 -- Asp85 salt bridge observed in PlSOD . 
The Lys25?Pro mutation , in conjunction with the substitution of His131 with Tyr , may be responsible for the decreased sensitivity of the StSOD dimeric structure to pH variations with respect to the PlSOD one . 
Thus , the dissociation into monomers induced by an increase in pH from 6.8 to 8.0 is more evident in apo-PlSOD than in apo-StSOD . 
In the holoproteins , due the stabilizing effec of the active site metals , the same pH shift induces only a change in shape . 
As for the apoproteins , the change is more marked in PlSOD ( Table 1 ) . 
These ﬁndings are in agreement with and provide a structural basis to the observation that different properties of the two enzymes are affected differentially by pH. Thus , a pH shift from 6.8 to 8.0 enhances sensitivity of PlSOD to proteolytic attack remarkably and decreases the afinity for the active site metal to a much greater extent in PlSOD than in StSOD [ 15 ] . 
The sensitivity to alkaline pH is not restricted to dimeric Cu , Zn SODs . 
Similar effects have been reported for the monomeric E. coli enzyme . 
At alkaline pH values , E. coli Cu , Zn SOD is readily inactivated on native polyacrylamide gels [ 24,4 ] , displays changes in hydrodynamic properties [ 4 ] , exhibits a marked reduction in copper afinity and conformational stability [ 4 ] and undergoes an enhanced proteolytic inactivation [ 15 ] . 
These observations suggest that the pH-dependent change in shape revealed by the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments on PlSOD and StSOD might not depend simply on changes at the dimer interface , but may involve also intrasubunit structural modiﬁcations . 
In turn , these intrasubunit conformational changes could involve regions surrounding the active site and , in particular , the long and solvent exposed S -- S subloop of loop 6,5 . 
In fact , molecular dynamics simulations and limited proteolysis studies on the E. coli enzyme have established that this region is characterized by the highest structural ﬂexibility [ 26 ] . 
A high ﬂexibility characterizes the same region also in PlSOD ( M. Falconi , personal communication ) . 
A signiﬁcant difference between PlSOD and StSOD is a three residues deletion in PlSOD that eliminates loop 1,2 . 
In StSOD loop 1,2 forms contacts with loop 6,5 and thereby is likely to contribute to its stabilization ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The connections between the two regions involve polar and non polar interactions between main chain atoms and side-chains . 
For example , inspection of the StSOD structure reveals that in one of the four subunits which give rise to the crystallographic unit , the Glu65 res-idue ( located in loop 6,5 ) forms a hydrogen bond with Ser13 ( located in loop 1,2 ) . 
This kind of interaction can not occur in PlSOD due to the above mentioned three amino acids deletion . 
It is likely that the intrasubunit contacts between loops 1,2 and 6,5 contribute to stabilize not only the StSOD monomer , but also the dimer in view of the marked long-range communication between the active site and the dimer interface revealed by the effects of metallation on subunit association . 
Interestingly , very recent studies indicate that communication between the active site and the dimer interface is not restricted to bacterial Cu , Zn SODs , but is likely to occur also in the eukaryotic enzymes . 
In fact , the characterization of human Cu , Zn SOD mutants found in association with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis revealed that several of these mutants have a decreased capacity to bind the active site metals that signiﬁcantly affects the ability to form stable dimers [ 27 -- 30 ] . 
Long-range communication between the active site and the subunit interface therefore appears to be a common feature of all Cu , Zn SODs . 
In conclusion , the characterization of two natural bacterial Cu , Zn SODs in terms of their state of association reveals quantitative differences in dimer stability that appear to be correlated with the functional properties of the two enzymes at neutral and alkaline pH values . 
Although these differences are likely to reﬂect amino acid substitutions at the subunit interface , we suggest that conformational changes near the active site could provide a signiﬁcant contribution in the stabilization of the dimeric structure . 
In more general terms it is tempting to speculate on the possible physiological implications of the observed difference in dimer stability of PlSOD and StSOD . 
In fact , despite the many insights into the structural/functional properties of Cu , Zn SODs , there is still debate concerning the signiﬁcance of the structural variability observed in this class of enzymes and their effective role in bacteria . 
Thus , whereas in some bacteria the expression of periplasmic Cu , Zn SOD is clearly correlated to the ability to multiply within the infected host , in others the role of the enzyme is still uncharacterized and likely unrelated to pathogenesis [ 18,19 ] . 
StSOD signiﬁcantly contributes to Salmonella ability to infect its host and is characterized by higher catalytic activity and structural stability in comparison with other bacterial Cu , Zn SODs [ 15 ] . 
A similar correlation applies also to other Cu , Zn SODs from bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae [ 15 ] and E. coli 0157 : H7 ( A. Battistoni unpublished observations ) , suggesting that structural stability in particular has been optimized to resist the harsh environmental conditions encountered by bacteria during infection . 
In this framework , alterations in dimer assembly could act as major structural determinants in modulating the functional properties of Cu , Zn SODs in different bacteria .
