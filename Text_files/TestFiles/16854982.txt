The R2 protein of class I ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) generates and stores a tyrosyl radical , located next to a diferric iron center , which is essential for ribonucleotide reduction and thus DNA synthesis . 
X-ray structures of class Ia and Ib proteins from various organisms served as bases for detailed mechanistic suggestions . 
The active site tyrosine in R2F of class Ib RNR of Sal-monella typhimurium is located at larger distance to the diiron site , and shows a different side chain orientation , as compared with the tyrosine in R2 of class Ia RNR from Escherichia coli . 
No structural information has been available for the active tyrosyl radical in R2F . 
Here we report on high field EPR experiments of single crystals of R2F from S. typhimurium , containing the radical Tyr-105 . 
Full rotational pattern of the spectra were recorded , and the orientation of the g-tensor axes were determined , which directly reflect the orientation of the radical Tyr-105 in the crystal frame . 
Comparison with the orientation of the reduced tyrosine Tyr-105-OH from the x-ray structure reveals a rotation of the tyrosyl side chain , which reduces the distance between the tyrosyl radical and the nearest iron ligands toward similar values as observed earlier for Tyr-122 in E. coli R2 . 
Presence of the substrate binding subunit R1E did not change the EPR spectra of Tyr-105 , indicating that binding of R2E alone induces no structural change of the diiron site . 
The present study demonstrates that structural and functional information about active radical states can be obtained by combining x-ray and high-field-EPR crystallography .

thesis ( 1 -- 5 ) . 
In all RNRs investigated so far , a presumed transient thiyl radical in the large protein subunit near the bound substrate ( Cys-439 , Escherichia coli numbering ) is supposed to start the substrate turnover by the abstraction of the 3 - H from the ribonucleotide . 
The substrate turnover proceeds through a series of intermediate states , some of which are radicals . 
The thiyl radical is recovered , after the product ( deoxyribonucle-otide ) is formed and released ( 1 -- 8 ) . 
There are three classes of RNR , which are classified according to their different way to generate the transient thiyl radical ( 4 , 7 , 10 -- 14 ) . 
In class I RNR enzymes a tyrosyl radical in a second subunit R2 is proposed to generate the transient thiyl radical near the bound substrate in subunit R1 by a long range proton coupled electron transfer process . 
The tyrosyl radical in R2 is generated by a reaction of a nearby diiron center with molecular oxygen ( 1 -- 5 , 15 , 16 ) . 
Class II RNRs utilize a cobalt cofactor , the vitamin B12 derivative adenosylcobalamin , that interacts directly with the cysteine near the substrate to form the thiyl radical needed for the ribo-nucleotide reduction ( 4 , 13 , 14 , 17 ) . 
Class III RNRs consist of two subunits . 
A glycyl radical is generated in the small subunit , which is named activase , by a reaction of a [ 4Fe-4S ] - cluster with S-adenosylmethionine . 
This glycyl radical is believed to generate the thiyl radical near the substrate , when the allosteric activators and substrate are bound ( 10 -- 12 , 18 , 19 ) . 
Class I RNR has been most extensively investigated . 
It is pres-ent in all eukaryotes and some bacteria like E. coli and Salmo-nella typhimurium . 
The E. coli enzyme contains two soluble homodimeric subunits R1 and R2 . 
R1 contains the substratebinding site and the essential cysteine ( Cys-439 ) , the location of the proposed transient thiyl radical . 
It also provides the binding sites of the allosteric effectors . 
The specificity is regulated by binding different deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates , which leads to the production of a balanced pool of deoxyribonucle-otides . 
A second allosteric binding site regulates the activity of the enzyme via binding of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) ( activation ) or deoxy-ATP ( dATP ) ( inhibition ) ( 8 ) . 
The second subunit R2 contains in the active state a stable tyrosyl radical near a diiron center . 
The two irons are in the III III Fe - Fe state and their spins couple to a S 0 ground state . 
Upon docking of the subunit R1 and binding of the substrate a radical transfer from the stable tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 ( E. coli numbering ) in the subunit R2 to the cysteine 439 in the subunit R1 is proposed , which initiates the substrate turnover ( 3 -- 5 , 7 , 
20 -- 26 ) . 
After the formation and the release of the product the radical character is transferred back to tyrosine Tyr-122 . 
In some bacteria as in E. coli and S. typhimurium a second RNR was found ( 27 -- 29 ) . 
The genes for these enzymes were labeled nrdE and nrdF . 
These enzymes have the same subunit composition and a significant sequence homology as compared with the corresponding class I enzymes but a lack of allosteric overall activity regulation ( 30 ) . 
The tyrosyl radical and the diiron center were also observed in these enzymes ( 31 , 32 ) , but the distance between the tyrosyl radical and the diiron center was significantly larger as compared with the corresponding class I enzymes ( 31 , 33 , 34 ) . 
This larger distance was observed in the x-ray structures of the R2F protein of S. typhimurium ( 31 ) , reduced R2F protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( 34 ) and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes ( 33 ) and additionally supported by the results of EPR saturation measurements of M. tuberculosis ( 35 ) and Bacillus anthracis ( 36 ) . 
In M. tuberculosis the tyrosyl radical showed a different type of EPR spectrum as compared with the corresponding class I enzymes and resembles more the type of the tyrosyl radical YD in plant photosystem II ( 37 ) , which indicates a different conformation of the dihedral angle of the tyrosyl side chain protons , caused by a different side chain orientation as compared with the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 for E. coli RNR ( 38 -- 40 ) . 
Based on these differences class I RNR enzymes were subdivided into classes Ia and Ib . 
The subunits of class Ib RNR were named R1E and R2F ( corresponding to genes nrdE and nrdF ) . 
The class Ib enzymes were found to be fully functional but not essential for E. coli and S. typhimurium ( 41 ) . 
The reason for having two functional class I enzymes is not well understood . 
Class Ib enzymes were also found in M. tuberculosis ( 34 , 42 ) , C. ammoniagenes ( 33 ) , Lactococcus lactis ( 43 ) , and B. subtilis ( 44 ) . 
The crystal structure of RNR subunit R2F from S. typhi-murium is available for the reduced diferrous ( FeII-FeII-Y105-OH ) and the diferric met form ( FeIII-FeIII-Y105-OH ) lacking the radical Tyr-105 ( 31 ) . 
The structural data for both subunits R1 and R2 of class I RNR , together with kinetic data and theoretical calculations were the basis for the proposed mechanistic model involving a radical transfer from the tyrosyl radical in protein R2 to protein R1 , thereby generating the essential transient thiyl radical near the substrate ( 3 -- 5 , 7 , 20 -- 22 , 24 -- 26 ) . 
However , until now , no structural data for the radical containing form are available . 
Hence , there is no information about the orientation and location of the active tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in S. typhimurium . 
Recently it was shown that the orientation of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 in E. coli can be obtained by a combination of high-field single crystal EPR and x-ray crystallography ( 39 ) . 
In that work a small but significant reorientation of the tyrosine upon radical formation was observed for class I RNR in E. coli . 
This reorientation moved the radical away from the diiron center and disconnected it from the hydrogen bond network , which is proposed to be the pathway of the catalytic radical transfer ( 1 , 5 , 7 , 25 , 26 , 39 ) . 
The tyrosyl radical in class Ib RNR has a larger distance to the Fe1 and the spectroscopic data indicate , that it is in a more rigid pocket as compared with the radical in E. coli R2 ( 31 , 33 -- 35 ) . 
Therefore it is of important mechanistic interest whether a similar reorientation upon radical formation as observed for class Ia , occurs also in class Ib . 
The first step in the radical transfer reaction from the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 to cysteine Cys-439 ( E. coli numbering ) is by theoretical studies proposed to be a hydrogen abstraction from the terminal water bound to Fe1 by the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 ( 25 , 26 ) . 
For this reaction the tyrosyl radical has to move toward the diiron center . 
So far it is not known , which reaction ( docking of protein subunits R1 and R2 , or substrate binding in the holoenzyme R1 R2 complex ) triggers the long range electron transfer generating the thiyl radical . 
In this context it is important to investigate whether there is a structural reorientation of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 upon formation of the holocomplex R1E R2F complex as compared with the tyrosyl radical in the isolated R2F subunit . 
Here we report a detailed EPR-spectroscopic characterization of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in frozen solutions and single crystals of R2F from S. typhimurium and the tyrosyl radical in frozen solutions and single crystals of the holoenzyme complex R1E R2F . 
The orientation of the radical Tyr-105 in the subunit R2F with respect to the crystal axes is obtained by the analysis of the high-field EPR data of the R2F single crystals . 
The results are compared with those from R2 of E. coli RNR ( 39 ) and discussed with respect to the mechanistic model . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Expression and Purification -- Wild-type S. typhi-murium R2F and R1E were expressed and purified as earlier described in Refs . 
31 and 45 . 
Radical Generation in Solution -- The tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in R2F was generated from the met form ( FeIIIFeIII-Y105-OH ) by the `` shunt pathway '' using hydrogen peroxide . 
Hydrogen peroxide was added to the protein solutions ( 0.5 mM R2F and 0.5 mM R1E R2F , respectively ) to reach a final concentration of 5 mM . 
This `` shunt pathway '' reaction was shown to generate the tyrosyl radical and restore protein activity for E. coli RNR ( 46 ) . 
Crystallization -- The R2F protein was crystallized as described in ( 31 ) . 
The R1E R2F holocomplex was crystallized as described in Ref . 
47 . 
Radical Generation in R2F and R1E R2F Single Crystals -- The crystals were mounted in a loop extending from a W-band EPR tube in such a way that no crystal axes coincided with the rotation axes ( along the EPR tube ) for the EPR measurements . 
In the oxidized FeIIIFeIII-Y105-OH ( met ) R2F and R1E R2F protein single crystals the radical was generated using the shunt pathway ( 46 ) based on the method described in Ref . 
39 . 
The crystals were soaked for 30 min in a solution corresponding to the crystallization conditions supplement with 10 mM H2O2 as well as cryo protectant ( 15 % PEG 400 for the R2F crystals and 25 % glycerol for the complex R1E R2F crystals ) . 
The estimated radical yield was 10 % , which is not enough for obtaining a x-ray structure of the radical form , but sufficient for high field single crystal EPR studies . 
The mounted crystals were then flash-fro-zen in liquid nitrogen and quickly transferred into the precooled EPR cryostat . 
Care was taken to avoid thawing of the mounted crystal by use of a cold metal shield extending over the sample holder during the transfer procedure . 
W-Band ( 94 GHz ) EPR Spectroscopy -- Continuous wave EPR measurements were performed on a commercial Elexsys E680 spectrometer ( Bruker , Rheinstetten , Germany ) operating at 94 GHz . 
Spectra were recorded at 40 K using a few microwatts microwave power to avoid saturation effects . 
All spectra were recorded in the `` persistent mode '' of the superconducting magnet by using room temperature coils for the field sweep ( maximum field sweep 80 mT ) , which provides a high linearity and stability of the magnetic field . 
The spectrometer design uses a W-band EPR cavity resonator that ensures a high sensitivity for small samples such as protein crystals . 
For the determination of the precise g-tensor values the microwave frequency was meas-ured by a frequency counter , which is integrated in the spectrometer . 
The magnetic field axes was calibrated with a g-standard ( Li in LiF , g 2.002293 0.000002 , Ref . 
48 ) at two different frequencies ( 93.8 GHz and 94.3 GHz ) . 
The instrumental limit for the absolute g-resolution obtained for the narrow signal of the g-tensor standard was 0.000005 ( Li in LiF , approximate line width 0.01 mT ) . 
Solutions of the R2F and R1E R2F of S. typhimurium were filled into the EPR quartz sample tube ( 0.87 mm o.d. , 0.7 mm i.d. ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen . 
The cold samples were transferred into the spectrometer cryostat . 
H2O2-treated R2F and R1E R2F single crystals ( 0.1 0.1 0.4 mm3 resp . 
0.1 0.1 0.1 mm3 ) were mounted to the EPR quartz sample tubes ( 0.87 mm o.d. , 0.7 mm i.d. , open on both ends ) as described above and frozen together with the tubes in liquid nitrogen and transferred in the frozen state into the cryostat of the spectrometer . 
The orientation dependent EPR spectra were recorded by rotation around the EPR tube axis perpendicular to the magnetic field axis in 7.5 o ( R2F ) and 15o ( R1E R2F ) steps , respectively . 
Spectra Analysis -- The EPR spectra from the frozen solution were simulated with a home written program ( using `` octave '' ( 49 ) ) that calculates resonance field positions in first order approximation for an electron spin S 1/2 system with aniso-tropic g - and hyperfine - ( hf ) tensors with an arbitrary relative orientation of tensor axes for a typical number of 10,000 orientations of the tyrosyl with respect to the magnetic field axis . 
The resulting histogram is convoluted with a derivative Gaussian line-shape function which finally leads to the resulting derivative EPR spectrum . 
First-order perturbation theory is a good approximation for the EPR spectra of tyrosyl radicals recorded at an applied field of 3.4 T , since all hyperfine terms are much smaller ( less than 10 3 ) as compared with the electron Zeeman term in the spin Hamilton operator in Equation 1 . 
Additional fitting of the frozen solution EPR spectra was performed using a similar program described earlier , based on second order perturbation theory and including a fit algorithm ( 50 ) . 
Both programs yielded identical results . 
The EPR spectra of single crystals were simulated and fitted by another self-written program ( using `` octave '' ( 49 ) ) that calculates resonant field positions for the tyrosyl radical for all sites in the crystal ( space group R2F single crystal : P21 ) and for all measured orientations to first-order perturbation theory . 
The resulting histogram is again convoluted with a derivative Gaussian line-shape . 
The calculation of the angular dependent resonant field positions is based on the angular dependent spin 
Hamilton operator , which includes the crystal symmetry operations in Equation 1 , 
H T T T T 1{B0( BRR1RdRggRg Rd R1 R S k ngnIk)
SRR R R R A R TR TR TR TRTI } ( Eq . 
1 ) k 1 d g k k k g d 1 k where B0 is the magnetic field operator , B is the Bohr magneton , g the electronic g-tensor , n and gn the nuclear magneton and g factor , S the electron spin operator and Ak and Ik the hf-tensor and the nuclear spin operator of the nucleus k . 
The angular dependence of the radical in each crystal site is contained in rotation matrices R and transposed counterparts RT. . 
These describe the orientation of the g-tensor with respect to the crystal axes system ( Rg ) , the rotation transforming the homodimeric protein chain A into chain B ( Rd ) , the rotation generating from a given site ( l 1 ) the other site ( l 2 ) within the crystal space group P2 o 1 ( 180 rotation around the crystal axis b ) ( Rl ) , and finally the orientation of the crystal axes system with respect to the laboratory frame , where the magnetic field defines the x-axis and the EPR-tube axis the z-axis ( R ) . 
The first sum in Equation 1 runs over the sites l 1,2 and the second sum over the number of relevant 1H-nuclei in the tyrosyl radical ( k 1,2,3 ) . 
All rotational matrices are defined by three Euler angles , which leads to 15 independent parameters of the rotational dependence in the first term ( Zeeman term ) of the Ham-ilton operator . 
Nine Euler angles are defined by the x-ray structure ( Rl ( l 1,2 ) , Rd ) . 
The additional nine Euler angles for the orientation of the hf-tensors of the tyrosyl ring protons 3,5 and the - proton ( Fig. 1 ) ( Rk ) were obtained together with the principal values of tensors g and Ak form the simulation of the 94 GHz EPR spectrum in frozen solution samples ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The remaining six Euler angles for the orientation of the g-tensor axes system with respect to the crystal axes system ( Rg ) and for the orientation of the crystal axes system with respect to the laboratory frame ( R ) were obtained from a simultaneous fit for the EPR spectra from all angles using a combination of a simplex downhill algorithm ( 51 ) and a simulated annealing algorithm ( 51 ) to avoid the trapping of the fitting algorithm in one of the various local minima , which arise from the resolved hyperfine structure . 
The same program and algorithm except for the different space group was used in our previous work on R2 E. coli single crystals ( 39 ) . 
A similar simulation and fit strategy was also described in Ref . 
37 . 
RESULTS
Frozen Solution W-band EPR of Tyr-105 of S. typhimurium R2F and R1E R2F -- The 94 GHz continuous wave spectra from frozen solution samples of Tyr-105 in isolated subunit R2F and in the holoenzyme complex R1E R2F of S. typhimurium RNR are shown in Fig. 2 . 
The g-tensor and hf-tensor principal values ( Tables 1 and 3 ) were obtained from a fit of the spectra with the programs described above and agree well with the previously obtained values ( 32 ) . 
In class Ia and Ib RNR two different groups of gx-values of the tyrosyl radical were observed . 
Table 1 summarizes g-tensors for tyrosyl radicals from different selected class I RNRs . 
It was shown theoretically and experimentally that the gx-value is sensitive to the electrostatic environment of the tyrosyl radical in particular to hydrogen bonds between the C O group of the tyrosyl radical and the protein environment ( 6 , 52 -- 57 ) . 
The gx-value of 2.00916 ( 5 ) obtained for the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in R2F and R1E R2F of S. typhimurium clearly belongs to the first type of tyrosyl radicals as in E. coli , which is not hydrogenbonded . 
In contrast , in a second type the tyrosyl radical is hydrogen-bonded . 
For the radical in mouse and yeast RNR hydrogen bonding was unambiguously proven by D-ENDOR on D2O-exchanged samples ( 56 , 58 , 59 ) . 
This indicates that the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 is in a hydrophobic environment and not hydrogen-bonded . 
The EPR spectra ( Fig. 2 ) show a very good resolution of the g-tensor and hf-tensor components . 
In a heterogeneous environment with different polar interactions a distribution of gxvalues would be expected as observed for tyrosyl radicals in heme enzymes ( 52 , 57 ) . 
Hence , the well-resolved EPR spectra for the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in R2F and in the holoenzyme complex R1E R2F indicate a well-defined environment and absence of structural heterogeneity . 
For the tyrosyl radical in class Ib RNR of M. tuberculosis a distribution of the gx range with two maxima at gx 2.0091 and gx 2.0080 was observed ( 35 ) . 
It was interpreted as structural heterogeneity with a weak hydrogen-bonded tyrosyl radical in a fraction of the sample . 
An important result is , that within the experimental error margins the same g - and hf-tensors were determined for the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in the R2F subunit alone and in the holocomplex of R1E R2F . 
This indicates that no change of the structure and protein interactions of the radical occur upon binding of the second subunit R1 . 
W-band EPR on Tyr-105 in R2F S. typhimurium Single Crystals -- Orientation-dependent 94 GHz EPR spectra of two H2O2 treated R2F single crystals are shown in Fig. 3 . 
The spectra show a superposition of angular-dependent g-shifts and hyperfine splittings from four magnetically inequivalent sites ( two different sites from the crystal symmetry space group ( P21 ) , doubled by the two different protein chains A and B in the asymmetric unit ) . 
The spectra were analyzed by the program described above ( see `` Materials and Methods '' ) based on the Hamilton operator in Equation 1 . 
For the fit of the angular-dependent spectra in a first step the g-tensor and hf-tensor principal values and the relative orientations of g - and hf-tensor principal axes were taken from the simulation of the frozen solution EPR spectrum ( Tables 1 and 3 ) . 
relative radical yields in E. coli RNR protein R2 single crystals , where 60 -- 70 % radical yield was found in protein chain A and only 30 -- 40 % in chain B. ( 39 ) . 
W-band EPR on Tyr-105 in R1E R2F S. typhimurium Single Crystals -- Attempts were made to obtain 94 GHz EPR spectra of the radical Tyr-105 also from H2O2-treated R1E R2F holoenzyme single crystals . 
Fig. 4 shows spectra from one R1E R2F crystal for five orientations in comparison with the spectrum obtained in frozen solution of the complex . 
The single crystal spectra exhibit a much smaller signal to noise ratio as compared with the R2F S. typhimurium single crystals and resemble for some orientations almost the frozen solution spectrum . 
This is because of several factors . 
First , the single crystals of the holoenzyme were significantly smaller ( approximately a factor of 5 in volume ) as compared with the single crystals of the R2F subunit alone . 
Furthermore , the orientationdependent EPR spectra of the tyrosyl radical in the holoenzyme single crystals are superimposed by signals of unspecific bound manganese ions . 
Most important , for the space group of the R1E R2F S. typhimurium single crystals ( P4132 ) , 48 magnetically inequivalent sites ( radical orientations ) are expected . 
Thereby the intensity is distributed nearly over the whole range of orientations as in the frozen solution spectrum , and the superposition of the 48 magnetically inequivalent sites make a unique evaluation of these spectra , and hence a determination of the orientation of the g-tensor axes of the radical Tyr-105 impossible . 
However , the observed orientation dependence of the R1E R2F S. typhimurium single crystal EPR spectra demonstrates , that the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 is generated by the H2O2 shunt reaction in the single crystals of the R1E R2F holoenzyme complex . 
The comparison of the frozen solution spectrum of the R1E R2F holoenzyme with the orientation-de-pendent spectra of the R1E R2F holoenzyme single crystal indicates that the g - and hf-tensor principal values are the same , and that the tyrosine radical is in both cases not hydrogenbonded . 
Therefore , neither the formation of the R1E R2F complex nor the crystallization seem to introduce a change of polarity in the protein environment or a reorientation of the tyrosine side chain , for which a major change of the hyperfine pattern would be expected ( see below ) . 
DISCUSSION
In the widely accepted model of the catalytic mechanism of the class Ia RNR , the binding of the substrate in subunit R1 and docking of both subunits R1 and R2 initiates the radical transfer process , mostly described as coupled proton-electron transfer , from the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 in protein subunit R2 to the transient cysteine radical Cys-439 ( E. coli numbering ) in protein subunit R1 ( 1 , 5 , 7 , 25 , 26 , 61 ) . 
Details of this proposed radical transfer reaction are still not revealed . 
The assumed transient thiyl radical Cys-439 could so far not be detected , presumably because of unfavorable relative kinetics of radical transfer and substrate turnover reactions , which could lead to very small yields of intermediate radicals ( 4 , 5 ) . 
Recent studies of pre-steady state kinetics indicate that either a conformational change , prior to the chemical reactions , or rereduction of the active site disulfide is the rate-limiting step ( 62 ) . 
So far no radical intermediates along the proposed transfer pathway were observed . 
However , recently the involvement of Tyr-356 in the C-terminal tail of protein subunit R2 , which is essential for interaction with the substrate binding subunit R1 ( 63 ) , was demonstrated by substituting Tyr-356 with fluorinated derivatives ( 64 ) . 
Strong evidence for the proposed radical transfer results also from earlier experiments with substrate analogous inhibitors like acido-CDP , which bind at the substrate binding site in protein R1 and , under turnover conditions , form a radical , tightly bound in the protein pocket , at the expense of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 in protein R2 ( 66 -- 68 ) . 
Theoretical studies have indicated that the first step of the radical transfer process is an abstraction of a hydrogen from the terminal water coordinated to Fe1 by the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 ( 26 ) . 
This requires a significant transient displacement of the tyrosyl radical . 
In the class Ib RNR in S. typhimurium the distance between the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 oxygen and the terminal water at Fe1 in the subunit R2F is larger ( 5.03 Å ) as compared with the respective distance for R2 of E. coli ( 4.3 Å ) ( 39 ) . 
In this context it is highly interesting , whether a displacement and concomitant spectroscopic change of the tyrosyl radical is induced by the formation of the R1E R2F complex . 
The frozen solution EPR spectra of Tyr-105 in R2F and in the holoenzyme R1E R2F are virtually identical . 
Independent simulations and fits of the both frozen solution spectra lead to identical g - and hf-tensors within the experimental error margins . 
It has been shown in many previous studies that the gxvalue of the tyrosyl radical is very sensitive for polar interactions in particular hydrogen bonding to the oxygen of the tyrosine ring ( 52 -- 58 ) . 
Table 1 shows the g-tensor values of the tyrosyl radical for a variety of class Ia and Ib RNRs . 
The radical Tyr-105 in S. typhimurium clearly resembles the case of tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 in E. coli RNR . 
Both radicals are in a hydrophobic pocket and not hydrogen bonded , having gx-values of 2.00912 and 2.00916 , respectively . 
For the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 this gx-values stays unchanged when the holoenzyme crystal complex R1E R2F is formed . 
The main interaction between R1E and R2F in the crystal is the binding of one R2F C terminus ( 11 residues ) in a hydrophobic pocket of one R1E monomer ( 47 ) . 
We conclude that this specific subunit interaction alone does not induce a change in the electrostatic environment of Tyr-105 in S. typhimurium . 
Otherwise the gx-value would shift from 2.0091 ( hydrophobic environment , E. coli ( 38 , 39 ) ) to values of 2.0076 for the case of a more polar environment ( 52 -- 58 ) ( see Table 1 ) . 
This finding clearly indicates that also in the R1E R2F complex the radical Tyr-105 is disconnected from a hydrogen bond network along a pathway of amino acid residues connecting the diiron site in R2 with the substrate binding site in R1 ( 61 , 64 ) . 
An interesting difference in the EPR spectra of the tyrosine radical Tyr-105 in S. typhimurium and Tyr-122 in E. coli is the pronounced difference in the large and almost isotropic hyperfine tensor from one - proton of the side chain ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This is clearly seen in the 94 GHz EPR spectra from frozen solutions shown in Fig. 2 , where this hyperfine coupling is best resolved on the gy-component . 
Table 3 compares the proton hf-tensor values of Tyr-105 in different S. typhimurium RNR samples with those of Tyr-122 from E. coli RNR . 
Whereas the hyperfine tensors of the ring protons ( positions 3 and 5 , Fig. 1 ) depend solely on the spin density on the neighboring carbon atom , the isotropic part of the coupling of H ( 1 ) ( see Fig. 1 ) is strongly dependent on the side-chain orientation ( 38 , 40 , 69 , 70 ) , according to Equation 2 , where C is the spin density at the adjacent - carbon atom , B and B are empirical constants , and is the dihedral angle between the side chain C-H bond and the pz-axis of the adjacent carbon ( C1 ) of the - system ( see Fig. 1 ) . 
From the measured value Aiso ( Axx Ayy Azz ) / 3 29.5 MHz ( 1.1 mT ) and by using a spin density at C1 of 0.38 -- 0.39 ( 40 , 71 ) and a B value between 5.24 and 5.7 mT ( 40 , 71 ) , 2.8 MHz 0.1 mT , B is negligible ) , we estimate a dihedral angle for the 1-proton in Tyr-105 between 42o and 45o . 
The respective angle for Tyr-122 from E. coli is between 12o and 16o ( 39 ) , resulting in the much larger hyperfine coupling for the respective side chain proton ( compare Table 3 and Equation 2 ) . 
The smaller hyperfine coupling of the side chain and the corresponding larger dihedral angle is a common feature for the tyrosyl radicals in all class Ib RNRs investigated so far by EPR ( S. typhimurium ( 32 ) , M. tuberculosis ( 55 , 72 ) , C. ammoniagenes ( 73 ) ) . 
The experimental result for the dihedral angle of the - proton of Tyr-105 presented here is very close to the respective angle of 41o obtained from the crystal structure of R2F from S. typhimurium ( PDB code 2R2F ) ( 31 ) for the reduced tyrosine Tyr-105-OH in protein chain A . 
This indicates that there is no change of the dihedral angle of H 1 upon radical formation within the experimental error margins ( 3o ) . 
A significantly different dihedral angle of 32o is found for the 1-proton obtained from the tyrosine Tyr-105-OH in protein chain B . 
This dihedral angle would correspond to an isotropic coupling Aiso 42 -- 45 MHz which could be ruled out from the simulation of the frozen solution EPR spectra . 
In principle , three different cases could explain this finding : First , the radical yield of Tyr-105 is 100 % in chain A , or second , a reorientation of the tyrosine side chain occurs upon radical formation only in protein chain B , or third , the crystal structure 2R2F ( 31 ) shows a wrong dihedral angle for Tyr-105-OH in chain B . 
The analysis of the orientation-dependent 94 GHz EPR spectra of Tyr-105 in R2F single crystals leads to a distribution of 50 % radical yield in chain A and 50 % radical yield in chain B ( error 10 % ) , hence ruling out case one . 
We consider case two , a selective radical reorientation only in protein chain B as unlikely . 
In view of the much larger temperature factors ( factor 2 ) in the x-ray structure 2R2F for Tyr-105-OH in protein chain B as compared with chain A , we consider case three , a less defined side chain orientation in protein chain B because of higher disorder , the most likely case for the apparent difference in dihedral angles . 
Therefore , we restrict our discussion of radical reorientation to the much better defined structure of protein chain A . 
This procedure is further justified by the finding , that the orientation of the gz-axes in protein chain B , obtained from the simulation of the orientation dependent EPR spectra , leads to the same dihedral angle for the tyrosyl side chain as for the tyrosyl radical in protein chain A . 
That is in line with the obtained hyperfine coupling for the side chain proton ( H 1 ) , which has the same value for the radical Tyr-105 in both protein chains ( Table 3 ) . 
The error of the experimentally determined g-tensor axes , and hence the molecular axes of the radical Tyr-105 ( Fig. 1 ) in the crystal axis system was estimated to be 1o , as for the case of the tyrosyl radical in E. coli RNR ( 39 ) . 
In order to determine the significance of the radical reorientation , expressed in the angles between the reduced tyrosine and the radical form , given in Table 2 , it is also necessary to estimate the error of the x-ray coordinates . 
Based on the larger temperature factors for Tyr-105-OH in the S. typhimurium structure ( 31 ) as compared with Tyr-122-OH in the E. coli structure ( 39 ) , we estimate an error for the tyrosine molecular axes of 3o . 
Reorientation of the Tyrosine Radical -- The angles for the radical reorientation in Table 2 are about a factor of two larger than the estimated error margins , and describe a small rotation by 6o to 7o in the gx-gz-plane . 
The deduced rotation of the tyrosine upon radical formation is visualized in Fig. 5 , showing the diiron site with amino acid and water ligands and part of the proposed catalytic electron/proton pathway , involving His-101 , Asp-191 , and Trp-31 in R2 . 
Under the assumption that no backbone motion occurs , and the tyrosine radical rotation originates in the tyrosine side chain , the depicted g-tensor axes are those of the radical . 
It can be seen , that this rotation moves the oxygen of the tyrosine radical closer to one of the oxygens of Asp-67 , and the terminal water ligand of Fe1 . 
The obtained angles ( Table 2 ) describing the deviation between the orientation of the molecular x - , y - , and z-axes of the radical Tyr-105 and the molecular axes of the reduced tyrosine Tyr-105-OH in R2F S. typhimurium ( 7o ( 3o ) , 2o ( 3o ) , and 6o ( 3o ) ) are a bit smaller than those obtained for the Tyr-122 and Tyr-122-OH molecular x - , y - , and z - axes in E. coli RNR ( 10o ( 1o ) , 8o ( 1o ) , and 5o ( 1o ) ) ( 39 ) , but differ in the direction of rotation ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The location of the radical Tyr-122 in E. coli and in particular the position of the tyrosyl oxygen , which is proposed to be involved in a transient hydrogen abstraction reaction was estimated under the assumption of negligible backbone motion . 
Two single bond rotations about C - C by 11o and about C - C1 by 3o ( see Figs. 1 and 5 ) were performed on the reduced tyrosine to reproduce the orientation of the radical axes in E. coli RNR with a deviation less than 2o ( 39 ) . 
Compared with the reduced tyrosine Tyr-122-OH , the radical Tyr-122 is rotated away from the diiron center in E. coli RNR . 
Whereas the reduced tyrosine in E. coli RNR is supposed to form a weak hydrogen bond to one of the oxygens of Asp-84 , which is coordinated to the diiron center , the increased distance found for the radical form was clearly beyond hydrogen bonding distance ( 39 ) . 
It has been proposed in an earlier theoretical study that the first step of the long-range radical-transfer process is a transient hydrogen atom abstraction from the terminal water ligand at Fe1 by the tyrosyl radical and subsequent formation of a radical character on Trp-48 ( E. coli numbering ) in one step ( 25 , 26 ) . 
In line with this proposal , a movement of the tyrosyl radical toward the diiron center was suggested ( 39 ) . 
Therefore , the reduced form Tyr-122-OH in E. coli might reflect a transient orientation of the tyrosine radical during the radical-transfer cycle , when it becomes transiently protonated ( 39 ) . 
To understand the role of the observed small reorientation of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-105 in S. typhimurium is more difficult . 
Applying single bond rotations about C - C by 5o and about C - C by 1o 1 reproduces the orientation of the g-tensor obtained by the analysis of the orientation dependent 94 GHz EPR spectra within a remaining deviation of 4o for each axes , which is just slightly above the estimated error margin of 3o , for the deviation between the g-tensor axes of the radical Tyr-105 and the molecular axes of the reduced tyrosine Tyr-105-OH . 
This indicates that again no movement of the protein backbone needs to be assumed for rotation of the tyrosyl radical axes . 
A comparison of the x-ray structures of R2F S. typhimurium ( 31 ) and R2 E. coli ( 39 ) points out significant differences namely in the distance between the tyrosine and the diiron ligands . 
These distances , which we consider to be important in the context of the catalytic electron/proton transfer are : O ( Y105 ) O ( D67 ) 4.66 Å and 4.48 Å , and O ( Y105 ) O ( H2O-Fe1 ) 5.25 Å and 5.03 Å for the reduced tyrosine and the tyrosine radical form , respectively . 
Interestingly , there seems to occur a shortening of these distances by about 0.2 Å for the radical form in S. typhimurium . 
The corresponding distances for the tyrosyl reduced and radical forms in E. coli were determined in an earlier study ( 39 ) as O ( Y122 ) O ( D84 ) 3.35 Å and 4.27 Å , and O ( Y122 ) O ( H2O-Fe1 ) 3.83 Å and 4.30 Å , respectively . 
There , the distances are increased for the radical form . 
Interestingly , the distances between the respective tyrosyl radical and the nearest iron ligands are not too different for both enzyme classes . 
The larger distance between the oxygen of the reduced tyrosine and the oxygen of aspartate Asp-67 in S. typhimurium ( 4.66 Å ) , as compared with the respective distance in E. coli ( 3.35 Å ) , shows , that for S. typhimurium , in contrast to the case of E. coli , there is no hydrogen bond between these residues . 
Even the reduced form ( Tyr-105-OH ) of the tyrosine in S. typhimurium seems to be disconnected from the proposed cata-lytic hydrogen bond network . 
The radical reorientation in E. coli RNR was attributed mainly to electrostatic repulsion between the negative partial charges of the oxygens of the tyrosyl radical Tyr-122 and the close oxygen of aspartate Asp-84 ( 39 ) . 
The larger distance between tyrosine Tyr-105 and the diiron ligands in S. typhi-murium seems to reduce the electrostatic interactions resulting in a smaller radical reorientation . 
Similar larger distances between the active site tyrosine and the diiron ligands were observed in the x-ray structure of class Ib RNR of C. ammoniogenes ( 33 ) and were also deduced for the tyrosine radical states from relaxation studies , sensing the distance-dependent radi-cal-iron interaction in M. tuberculosis ( 35 ) . 
Interestingly , the x-ray structure of C. ammoniogenes ( 33 ) shows a water mole-cule between the reduced tyrosine and the aspartate . 
Such a water molecule is not present in the S. typhimurium structure . 
Both types , class Ia and Ib RNR , are proposed to have the same catalytic mechanism , involving electron/proton transfer to generate the presumed thiyl radical in protein subunit R1 from the tyrosyl radical in protein subunit R2 , though a larger tyrosine-iron distance was found in the x-ray structure of class Ib R2F ( 31 , 39 ) . 
Because the radical reorientations observed here for S. typhimurium class Ib R2F and earlier for E. coli class Ia R2 ( 39 ) are in opposite directions , the difference for the distances between the tyrosyl radical and the nearest iron ligands is less pronounced for both enzyme classes . 
The structural variations observed for both enzyme classes show that the catalytic radical transfer mechanism is robust against smaller structural variations , which are compensated by dynamic structural changes accompanying the electron and proton translocations during the radical generation and transfer reactions . 
The proposed first step of the catalytic radical transfer , hydrogen atom abstraction from the terminal water ligand of Fe1 ( 26 ) , requires presumably larger transient structural changes involving both reaction partners , the tyrosyl radical and the diiron aspartate and water ligands . 
From recent pre-steady-state kinetic studies of E. coli RNR , it was suggested , that a conformational change prior to the chemical reactions is the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction ( 62 ) . 
Our studies of the R2F/R1E complex of S. typhimurium class Ib RNR show , that binding of the second subunit R1E alone does not induce any structural change in the diiron-radical site . 
This is in line with a recent pulse EPR study on the R2 R1 complex of E. coli class Ia RNR , where the distance between the tyrosyl radical and an inhibitor radical in the substrate binding pocket was determined ( 9 ) . 
Our study shows that useful structural information of radical sites can be directly obtained by combining x-ray and high-field EPR crystallographic studies , also in cases where the achievable radical yield in the crystal is low . 
Further studies on the R1/R2 holoenzyme complexes , including holoenzyme crystals , will be required , to reveal which is the trigger mechanism for the catalytic electron / transfer process , and which further structural changes accompany this crucial first step in the catalytic reduction of ribo-nucleotides by class I RNRs .
