This report shows that Salmonella enterica catabolizes ethanolamine to acetyl-CoA ( Ac-CoA ) , which enters the glyoxylate bypass and tricarboxylic acid cycle for the generation of energy and central metabolites . 
During growth on ethanolamine , S. enterica excreted acetate , whose recapture depended on Ac-CoA synthetase ( Acs ) and the housekeeping phosphotransacetylase ( Pta ) 
enzyme activities . 
The Pta enzyme did not play a role in acetate excretion during growth of S. enterica on ethanolamine . 
It is proposed that during growth on ethanolamine , acetate excretion is necessary to maintain a pool of free CoA . 
Acetate excretion requires the eut operon-encoded phosphotransacetylase ( EutD ) and acetate kinase ( Ack ) enzymes .

INTRODUCTION 
The enterobacterium Salmonella enterica can use ethanol-amine and 1,2-propanediol as sources of carbon , energy , and , in the case of ethanolamine , nitrogen ( Blackwell & Turner , 1978 ; Bobik et al. , 1999 ; Chang & Chang , 1975 ; Roof & Roth , 1988 ) . 
Catabolism of ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol by this bacterium is intriguing . 
The biochemistry for the conversion of either compound is straightforward ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In both cases , an alcohol function is converted to the corresponding aldehyde by either coenzyme B12 ( AdoCbl ) - dependent deamination ( ethanolamine to acetaldehyde ) ( Faust et al. , 1990 ) or dehydration ( 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde ) ( Bobik et al. , 1997 ) . 
Acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetate , and propionaldeyde is oxidized to propionate , each of which is activated to its corresponding acyl-CoA derivative ( Bobik et al. , 1997 ; Faust et al. , 1990 ; Leal et al. , 2003 ) . 
In S. enterica , ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol are likely catabolized within a carboxysome-like structure ( Havemann

et al. , 2002 ; Havemann & Bobik , 2003 ; Kofoid et al. , 1999 ; Stojiljkovic et al. , 1995 ) , hereafter referred to as the meta-bolosome . 
Ethanolamine catabolism is important to the lifestyle of S. enterica in the gut , as strains unable to grow on ethanolamine are attenuated in the mouse model of infection ( Stojiljkovic et al. , 1995 ) . 
Results from in vivo expression technology ( IVET ) experiments have also indicated that 1,2-propanediol is relevant to the survival of S. enterica as a pathogen ( Conner et al. , 1998 ) . 
Why these compounds are metabolized within metabolosomes remains an open question . 
Genetic and biochemical analyses of S. enterica strains identiﬁed the chromosomal locus required for growth of this bacterium on ethanolamine ( Roof & Roth , 1988 , 1989 ) . 
Sequence analysis of the ethanolamine utilization ( eut ) operon revealed 17 open reading frames , eutSPQTDMNEJGHABCLKR ( Kofoid et al. , 1999 ; Stojiljkovic et al. , 1995 ) ( Fig. 2a ) . 
The eutR gene , located 39 to the operon and independently transcribed from it ( Sheppard & Roth , 1994 ) , encodes the EutR transcription activator protein , which becomes active in the presence of ethanolamine and coenzyme B12 ( Roof & Roth , 1988 , 1992 ; Sheppard & Roth , 1994 ) . 
Several of the eut genes ( e.g. eutSMNLK ) encode proteins with homology to cyanobacterial carboxysomal shell proteins ( Kofoid et al. , 
0002-8156 G 
2005 SGM 
1999 ; Stojiljkovic et al. , 1995 ) . 
In cyanobacteria and thio-bacilli , this multiprotein complex is involved in carbon dioxide ﬁxation and concentration ( Badger & Price , 2003 ; Baker et al. , 2000 ; Friedberg et al. , 1993 ) . 
The function of the metabolosome encoded by the eut operon remains unclear . 
In S. enterica , a similar multiprotein complex is assembled during growth on 1,2-propanediol ( Havemann et al. , 2002 ; Havemann & Bobik , 2003 ) , and it was suggested that this structure might be used to contain propionaldehyde ( Bobik et al. , 1999 ; Rondon et al. , 1995 ) . 
Similarly , the metabolosome involved in ethanolamine catabolism was proposed to contain acetaldehyde ( Rondon et al. , 1995 ) . 
At present , a good understanding of the physiology of ethanolamine catabolism is lacking . 
Work presented here provides insights into how S. enterica acquires carbon and energy from ethanolamine catabolism and reveals mechanisms that the cell uses to maintain a balance between acetylCoA ( Ac-CoA ) and free acetate ( Fig. 2b ) . 
On the basis of the data reported here , we propose that a fraction of ethanolamine is converted to acetate via the energy-conserving phosphotransacetylase ( EutD ) / acetate kinase ( Ack ) pathway , with no apparent involvement of the housekeeping phosphotransacetylase ( Pta ) enzyme . 
Ac-CoA synthetase ( Acs ) and Pta are responsible for recapturing acetate for later use via the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate bypass . 
METHODS
Bacterial strains , culture media and growth conditions . 
All bacterial strains used in this study were derivatives of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 . 
The genotypes of strains used in this work are listed in Table 1 . 
Bacterial strains were grown on nocarbon E minimal medium ( NCE ) ( Berkowitz et al. , 1968 ) supplemented with : ethanolamine ( 30 mM ) as the source of carbon and energy ; MgSO4 ( 1 mM ) ; L-methionine ( 0 ? 
5 mM ) ; cyanocobalamin ( 150 mM ) ; and trace minerals ( 1 : 100 , v/v ) ( Balch & Wolfe , 1976 ) . 
Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth was used as rich medium . 
Growth curves reported here were performed at least twice in 125 ml sidearm ﬂasks with vigorous shaking ( 200 r.p.m. ) at 37 uC . 
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma . 
Phage P22 transductions . 
All transductional crosses were performed as described by Davis et al. ( 1980 ) with phage P22 HT105/1 int-210 ( Schmieger , 1971 ; Schmieger & Bakhaus , 1973 ) . 
Transductants were freed of phage as described by Chan et al. ( 1972 ) .

Acyl-CoA synthesis from ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol . 
The ﬁrst step in ethanolamine or 1,2-propanediol catabolism is catalysed by a coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme that yields acetaldehyde or propionaldehyde , followed by an oxidation to the corresponding short-chain fatty acid , which is released as either acetyl - or propionyl-CoA .

PCR ampliﬁcations . 
Enzyplus ( ENZYPOL ) was used in PCR ampliﬁcation during construction of the eutD deletion strain of S. enterica . 
All reactions were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient PCR thermal cycler ( Brinkmann Instruments ) . 
All primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . 
Construction of non-polar eutD deletion . 
The deletion of eutD was constructed as described by Datsenko & Wanner ( 2000 ) , except that all manipulations were performed in S. enterica . 
The cat cassette + in plasmid pKD3 was ampliﬁed using PAGE-puriﬁed primers with 50 bp of perfect homology for the 59 and 39 ends of eutD : eutD59DEL ( 59-TGACGGTCGCCCAAATTCAACAACGGTTGGGAGAGAAGC-CATGATCATTGAACGCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-39 ) and eutD39DEL ( 59-CGTGTTTTCCTCTCATTAAAGGGGTCCAGAACG-GGACCGTTCATTCAACCAGTGTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA-39 ) . 
Construction of the deletion strain from this point was as described in the original protocol , except that the S. enterica strain JE6692 was used as the recipient . 
The presence of the deletion was conﬁrmed using ABI PRISM non-radioactive BigDye cycle terminator DNA sequencing methodology ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
DNA sequence was determined at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Wisconsin . 
Determination of excreted acetate during growth on ethanol-amine . 
Overnight cultures of S. enterica grown at 37 uC in LB were subcultured 1 : 100 into 20 ml NCE minimal medium containing ethanolamine as the source of carbon and energy . 
Samples ( 1 ml ) were removed at intervals , and the optical density of the culture was determined using a Klett colorimeter furnished with a red ﬁlter . 
Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13 000 g in a Microfuge 18 centrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) . 
A 500 ml sample of the supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0 ? 
45 mm Spin-X centrifuge tube ﬁlter ( Corning ) and acidiﬁed by the addition of 2 ? 
5 ml of a 5 M H2SO4 solution . 
Acidiﬁed samples were stored at 220 uC until used . 
HPLC was used to analyse the composition of the samples ( see below ) . 
HPLC analysis . 
Samples ( 200 ml ) containing organic acids excreted by the strains of S. enterica used in these studies were resolved using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a model 600 solvent delivery system , a model 900 photodiode array detector , and a column heater . 
An Aminex HPX-87H organic acid analysis column ( 30067 ? 
8 mm , 
Bio-Rads ) was maintained at 45 uC and developed isocratically with 0 ? 
005 M H2SO4 at a ﬂow rate of 0 ? 
6 ml min . 
Separations were 21 monitored at 210 nm . 
Under these conditions , acetate eluted 14 ? 
6 min after injection . 
The area under the peak corresponding to acetate was quantiﬁed using the Waters Millenium software package to determine the concentration of acetate in the sample . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
S. enterica undergoes acetate switch during growth on ethanolamine
As shown here , ethanolamine is an acetogenic carbon and energy source for S. enterica . 
During growth on ethanol-amine , this bacterium excreted and recaptured acetate as it would during the catabolism of other known acetogenic substrates ( e.g. glucose , serine , aspartate , etc. ) . 
The acetate switch , as deﬁned by A. Wolfe , is the physiological condition where acetate dissimilation equals its assimilation ( Wolfe , 2005 ) . 
During growth of wild-type S. enterica on ethanol-amine , the acetate switch occurred at late exponential phase , with acetate being completely depleted from the medium by the time the culture reached early stationary phase ( Fig. 3a ) . 
Pta enzyme activity is not required for acetate excretion during growth on ethanolamine , but it is required for acetate recapture 
It was previously reported that strains lacking the housekeeping Pta enzyme did not grow on ethanolamine ( Kofoid 
Fig. 2 . 
S. enterica gene functions needed to convert ethanolamine to acetate . 
( a ) Genes encoding proteins with a known or putative enzymic activity are indicated as such . 
Genes encoding proteins with homology to cyanobacterial carboxysome proteins are labelled with vertical arrows . 
Horizontal arrows above the operon identify the two transcripts encoded at this locus . 
EutR is the activator of transcription of the eut operon . 
( b ) Pathways for acetate activation in S. enterica . 
Depending on the external concentration of acetate , S. enterica uses either of two independent pathways to convert acetate to Ac-CoA . 
Low concentrations ( ¡ 10 mM ) of acetate require AMP-forming synthetase ( Acs ) activity ( right ) ; at cents 25 mM , acetate is converted to Ac-CoA by the acetate kinase ( Ack ) and phosphotransacetylase ( Pta , EutD ) enzymes ( left ) . 
§ Tn10d ( tet ) is an abbreviation of Tn10D16D17 ( Way et al. , 1984 ) . 
+ et al. , 1999 ) . 
In our hands , however , a S. enterica pta strain grew on ethanolamine as carbon and energy source at a rate similar to that measured for the wild-type strain , with both cultures reaching the same cell density ( Fig. 3a , b ) . 
In addition , the kinetics of acetate excretion and recapture in the pta and wild-type strains was very similar ( Fig. 3a , b ) . 
A strain lacking Acs enzyme activity depended on Pta to recapture excreted acetate . 
Unlike in the wild-type strain , acetate recapture in the acs strain was much slower , probably reﬂecting the kinetics of acetate recapture by the Pta enzyme ( Fig. 3c ) . 
An acs pta strain excreted acetate but did not recapture any of it ( Fig. 3d ) . 
Acetate excretion during growth on ethanolamine requires Ack activity
Parallel studies with a strain carrying an in-frame deletion of the ack gene ( lacked Ack ) showed a factor-of-two increase in the doubling time of the ack strain ( doubling time 3 ? 
9 h ) relative to that of the wild-type strain ( doubling time 2 ? 
1 h ) ( Fig. 3a vs Fig. 4 ) . 
A more profound difference between the strains was observed when the acetate excretion/recapture pattern was determined . 
Unlike the wild-type strain , the ack strain excreted only a small amount of acetate ( Fig. 3a vs Fig. 4 ) , suggesting that acetate excretion proceeded via acetyl phosphate ( Ac-P ) . 
Thus it appears that the slower growth rate of the ack strain may be due to an accumulation of Ac-P .

EutD phosphotransacetylase activity is not required for growth on ethanolamine
40 
A strain lacking the EutD phosphotransacetylase enzyme showed a slight decrease in the rate of growth and the ﬁnal cell density of the culture relative to the wild-type strain ( Fig. 5a ) . 
Both defects were readily corrected by the wildtype allele of eutD ( Fig. 5a ) . 
Similar results were obtained with a pta eutD strain ( Fig. 5b ) , consistent with the idea that phosphotransacetylase activity is not central to ethanol-amine catabolism in S. enterica .

We note that the growth behaviour of an eutD strain on ethanolamine was in sharp contrast to that of an eutE strain ( Fig. 5a ) , indicating that unlike EutD , EutE function was required for growth of S. enterica on ethanolamine . 
Although the absence of EutD activity only slightly affected growth of S. enterica on ethanolamine , in the absence of this enzyme acetate excretion was abolished during growth on ethanolamine ( Fig. 6a ; open triangles ) . 
Inactivation of the pta gene in an eutD strain did not affect growth rate , ﬁnal cell density , or acetate excretion ( Fig. 6b ) . 
Surprisingly , inactivation of the acs gene restored acetate excretion in the pta eutD strain , but no recapture was observed ( Fig. 6c ) , consistent with the ﬁnding that Acs and Pta activities were needed for recapture ( Fig. 3d ) . 
Based on these results , and others discussed above , we propose that ethanolamine catabolism proceeds via Ac-CoA , and that acetate is excreted via the EutD/Ack pathway .

The EutD/Ack pathway is needed for optimal growth on ethanolamine , but it is not essential . 
Differences in growth rate and cell yield between wild-type and eutD strains were corrected by introducing a wild-type allele of eutD on a plasmid ( pEUTD2 ) . 
This plasmid carried a wild-type allele of eutD under the control of the arabinose-inducible promoter in plasmid pBAD30 ( Guzman et al. , 1995 ) ; 200 mM L ( + ) - arabinose was added to the medium to induce eutD expression .

Excretion of acetate by the acs eutD pta strain could be explained in at least three ways . 
One way would involve an Ac-CoA hydrolase , a second way would involve pyruvate oxidase ( PoxB ) , and a third way would involve an un-identiﬁed system . 
We used the protein sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ac-CoA hydrolase ( Ach1p ) ( Buu et al. , 2003 ) to search for genes of Salmonella enterica encoding homologous proteins . 
The search yielded open reading frame STM3118 as the only gene possibly encoding a structural orthologue of Ach1p Ac-CoA hydrolase . 
We constructed an in-frame deletion of STM3118 in strain JE7498 ( eutD acs pta ) and studied the growth behaviour and acetate excretion pattern in the resulting strain ( JE7715 ) . 
In addition to growing on ethanol-amine to wild-type levels , strain JE7715 excreted as much acetate as did its parent strain JE7498 , indicating that STM3118 was not involved in acetate excretion in a strain lacking Acs , EutD and Pta activities ( data not shown ) . 
This result does not rule out the existence of non-orthologous replacements of Ach1p Ac-CoA hydrolase in S. enterica , a possibility that has not been investigated . 
Inactivation of either poxB or ack did not prevent acetate excretion in strains JE7832 ( poxB acs pta eutD ) or strain JE8326 ( eutD acs ack ) ( data not shown ) . 
Results obtained with the poxB mutant suggested that PoxB was not responsible for the observed acetate excretion in the acs pta eutD strain JE7832 . 
Results obtained with strain JE8326 suggested that acetate release in such a strain did not proceed via Ac-P . 
At present , the identity of the acetate-releasing system operating in the acs pta eutD strain remains unclear . 
Why is EutD, and not Pta, function required for ethanolamine catabolism?
One plausible answer to this question may lie in part in the kinetic differences between these enzymes . 
Although the S. enterica Pta enzyme ( SePta ) has not been isolated and characterized , its close relative from Escherichia coli ( EcPta ) has ( Brinsmade & Escalante-Semerena , 2004 ; Shimizu et al. , 1969 ; Suzuki , 1969 ) . 
The EutD enzyme has a sevenfold higher afﬁnity for CoA than does EcPta ( 46 vs 320 mM ) , a 23-fold higher afﬁnity for Ac-P than does EcPta ( 0 ? 
13 vs 3 mM ) , and a 10-fold higher speciﬁc activity than that reported for EcPta ( 3044 vs 333 ) . 
Relative to EcPta ( and , by extrapolation , to SePta ) , EutD is a very efﬁcient enzyme ( Brinsmade & Escalante-Semerena , 2004 ; Shimizu et al. , 1969 ; Suzuki , 1969 ) . 
The high afﬁnity of EutD for Ac-CoA and its presumable location within the ethanolamine meta-bolosome is proposed to prevent a non-physiological build-up of Ac-CoA , leading to a release of CoA and acetate and the concomitant production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation . 
Acetate excretion may help the cell minimize the negative effect of intracellular acetate accumulation on the pool of glutamate and other unidentiﬁed ions ( Roe et al. , 1998 ; Russell & Diez-Gonzalez , 1998 ) . 
Relief from the toxic effects of acetate during growth on ethanolamine would be reached when the acetate switch is ﬂipped towards acetate assimilation .

Model for ethanolamine degradation in S. enterica . 
The size of the ethanolamine metabolosome is not to scale . 
Growth on ethanolamine proceeds via the glyoxylate bypass and the Krebs cycle 
A strain lacking isocitrate dehydrogenase [ JE4561 icd1 : : + Tn10d ( tet ) ] did not grow on ethanolamine as the carbon and energy source on medium supplemented with glutamate , indicating that catabolism of ethanolamine proceeds via the tricarboxylic acid ( Krebs ) cycle . 
Similarly , a strain lacking malate synthase ( AceB ) and isocitrate lyase ( AceA ) activities ( strain JE4173 ) failed to grow on ethanolamine , indicating that the glyoxylate bypass is also required for the utilization of ethanolamine as the carbon and energy source . 
cycle and glyoxylate bypass , increasing the amount of carbon and energy available for growth . 
Elegant studies of acs expression indicate that the Acs level is very low in lowdensity cultures ( Browning et al. , 2004 ) , a fact that would explain the kinetics of acetate accumulation and recapture from the environment . 
The very efﬁcient EutD phosphotransacetylase , in conjunction with acetate kinase , regenerates free CoA , a process that appears to also involve an as-yet-unidentiﬁed acetate-releasing system . 
It is an enigma why in the absence of EutD phosphotransacetylase the housekeeping Pta phosphotransacetylase does not compensate for EutD . 
We propose that the absence of EutD may trigger the diversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol , avoiding the accumulation of Ac-CoA . 
This and other ideas are under investigation . 
A working model 
Fig. 7 summarizes our interpretation of the data reported in this paper . 
We postulate that in wild-type S. enterica , a portion of the ethanolamine-derived pool of Ac-CoA is converted to acetate and excreted into the medium for later use , with the remaining Ac-CoA entering central meta-bolism . 
Acetate excretion may be needed to regenerate free CoA . 
As the Acs level increases , exogenous acetate is recaptured by Acs and Ack/Pta and is catabolized via the TCA
