Abstract 
In this study we examined the extent of bioﬁlm formation in ﬁeld strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) , an important foodborne pathogen . 
Ninety-four ﬁeld strains of S. Typhimurium were tested for their ability to form bioﬁlm and components contributing to its formation . 
Most S. Typhimurium strains were highly capable of bioﬁlm formation except for strains of phage type DT2 originating from pigeons . 
The most efﬁcient bioﬁlm forming strains were those of phage type DT104 positive for Salmonella genomic island 1 ( SGI1 ) . 
A comparison of SGI1 positive and negative strains indicated that the increased bioﬁlm formation of SGI1 positive strains was associated with the presence of this genomic island . 
Finally , in ﬁve strains we found an alternative strategy of bioﬁlm formation independent of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose production but solely dependent on an overproduction of capsular polysaccharide . 
Due to a mucoid and brown appearance on Congo Red agar we designated these strains as belonging to the SBAM ( smooth brown and mucoid ) morphotype .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) periodically colonizes susceptible hosts or persists outside a host in the environment during its life cycle . 
To survive in the environment , S. Typhimurium has evolved several distinct mechanisms ( White et al. , 2006 ) and its ability to adhere to solid surfaces and to form bioﬁlms belongs among the most important . 
Extracellular structures contributing to bioﬁlm formation include curli ﬁmbriae ( Collinson et al. , 1996 ; Romling et al. , 1998b ) , cellulose ( Zogaj et al. , 2001 ; Solano et al. , 2002 ) , capsular polysaccharide ( De Rezende et al. , 2005 ) and other polysaccharides like LPS ( Anriany et al. , 2006 ) . 
Strains capable of bioﬁlm formation frequently form colonies of typical RDAR ( red , dry and rough ) morphotype which is caused by the coexpression of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose ( Romling , 2005 ) . 
Other morphotypes such as BDAR ( brown dry and rough ) or SAW ( smooth and white ) have been described in experiments with deletion mutants in csg genes required for curli ﬁmbriae synthesis ( Romling et al. , 1998a , 2000 ) or both csg and bcs genes coding for cellulose synthesis , respectively ( Solano et al. , 2002 ) . 
The contribution of the remaining bioﬁlm components to adhesion is less obvious ( De Rezende et al. , 2005 ) . 
In the mid-1980s , multidrug resistant strains of S. Typhimurium belonging to phage type DT104 were detected in the UK ( Threlfall et al. , 1994 ) . 
Strains of this clone are mostly resistant to ﬁve antibiotics and have been reported to be capable of efﬁcient bioﬁlm formation ( Anriany et al. , 2001 ; De Rezende et al. ,

The reasons for the successful spread of this clone are largely unknown . 
We speculated that the acquisition of the SGI1 resulted not only in antibiotic resistance but also in increased bioﬁlm formation which allowed the spread of this clone worldwide . 
In this study we therefore investigated to what extent the ability to form bioﬁlm is common to ﬁeld strains of S. Typhimurium and whether there is any difference in bioﬁlm production between SGI1 negative and positive S. Typhimurium .

2.1. Bacterial strains
a Number of strains . 
b Numbers in parentheses indicate num from 1 . 
Ninety-four S. Typhimurium strains originating from different hosts isolated in the Czech Republic from 2004 to 2007 were used in this study ( Table 1 ) . 
All but nine strains were phage typed according to Anderson et al. ( 1977 ) . 
All the strains were also classiﬁed by PCR speciﬁc for the absence of the STM0517 -- 0529 genes and the presence of SGI1 as described previously ( Matiasovicova et al. , 2007 ) . 
Additional 55 strains representing another 10 S. enterica serovars were screened for bioﬁlm formation as controls . 
These included serovars Agona ( n = 3 ) , Derby ( n = 9 ) , Heidelberg ( n = 2 ) , Enteritidis ( n = 19 ) , Infantis ( n = 8 ) , London ( n = 4 ) , Montevideo ( n = 3 ) , Saintpaul ( n = 2 ) , Virchow ( n = 2 ) and Zanzibar ( n = 3 ) .

2.2. Colony morphology and expression of cellulose and curli ﬁmbriae
Bacterial colony morphology was analyzed on LB agar without salt supplemented with Congo Red ( 40 mg ml ) and Coomassie brilliant blue 1 ( 20 mg ml ) . 
Cellulose production was determined 1 on the same agar supplemented with calcoﬂuor ( 20 mg ml ) . 
To assess colony morphology and 1 cellulose production , 18-h-old liquid bacterial cultures were serially diluted and plated on appropriate agar plates . 
After 96 h at 28 8C , the colony morpholog was determined on plates where tens of colonies were growing . 
For the detection of cellulose , colony ﬂuorescence was measured visually under 366 nm UV light .

2.3. Bioﬁlm formation
Eighteen-hour-old bacterial cultures of S. Typhi-murium grown in minimal medium ( M9 ) were 500 diluted and inoculated into 200 ml M9 medium in a ﬂat bottomed 96-well polystyrene microtitre plate . 
The plates were incubated statically at 28 8C . 
After 96 h , the microplates were processed according to the standard procedure ( Genevaux et al. , 1996 ) using safranin to stain the adherent bacteria . 
The experiment was repeated on three separate occasions . 
2.4. Capsular polysaccharide detection in bacterial culture
Enzyme-linked lectinsorbent assay ( ELLA , Ler-iche et al. , 2000 ) was adapted for the quantiﬁcation of mannose and glucose residues in planctonic bacterial culture . 
After a 48 h cultivation , OD600 nm was determined . 
Bacterial culture ( 200 ml ) from each well of the microplate was transferred to microtubes and 2 ml of concanavalin A labeled with peroxidase ( 1 g ml stock solution ) were added . 
After 1 h the 1 bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 1 min and processed as described by Leriche et al. ( 2000 ) for the adherent bacteria . 
The ﬁnal absorbance of each culture was measured at 405 nm and divided by OD600 nm to obtain capsular polysaccharide production per cell . 
2.5. Scanning electron microscopy
To visualize bioﬁlms attached to the glass slides , sterile rectangular slides were incubated in test tubes containing bacterial culture in M9 medium in a vertical position for 96 h at 28 8C . 
The slides with adherent bacteria were ﬁxed in 3 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 and serially dehydrated with acetone . 
All samples were critical-point dried , coated with gold alloy and examined with a Vega/LMU microscope under an 30 kV acceleration and 12,000 magniﬁcation . 
2.6. Statistical analysis
The comparison of bioﬁlm formation measured by safranin staining between strains differing in the presence or absence of SGI1 was performed by a t-test . 
ANOVA followed by Tuckey 's test was used for the comparison of capsular polysaccharide production among different morphotypes . 
All statistical calculations were carried out using SPSS v. 14.0 statistical software . 
3. Results
3.1. Colony morphology, cellulose and capsular polysaccharide production determine adhesive abilities of isolates
Four different colony morphotypes were detected among the investigated strains . 
In 17 strains we detected the previously described SAW morphotype , in 10 strains the BDAR morphotype was identiﬁed and the RDAR morphotype was found in 62 strains . 
In ﬁve strains we found a morphotype that had not been described previously . 
The strains of this morphotype grew on Congo Red agar in smooth brown colonies and were mucoid ( Fig. 1 ) , similar to the growth of lon mutants ( Torres-Cabassa and Gottesman , 1987 ) . 
The colonies did not produce cellulose but overproduced capsular polysaccharide as determined by the ELLA assay . 
The average amount of capsular polysaccharide in SBAM strains , expressed as absorbance measured by the ELLA assay , reached value 2.42 0.40 while the same values in SAW , BDAR and RDAR strains were 1.12 0.73 , 1.32 0.38 and 1.69 0.45 , respectively . 
This difference was conﬁrmed as signiﬁcant by ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tuckey 's test . 
We designated this morphotype as SBAM ( smooth brown and mucoid ) . 
The vast majority ( n = 76 ) of strains formed bioﬁlms on plastic microplates as well as on glass slides under the conditions tested and this ability correlated with the colony morphology . 
Sixteen strains of SAW morphotype did not adhere at all . 
The remaining one SAW strain isolated from cattle adhered poorly ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Strains of SBAM ( average bioﬁlm formation 0.72 0.27 ) and BDAR ( average bioﬁlm formation 0.60 0.34 ) morphotypes forme intermediate levels of bioﬁlm . 
Except for a single strain , 61 RDAR strains ( average bioﬁlm formation 1.21 0.32 ) were highly proﬁcient bioﬁlm producers ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In control strains of other serovars we found a similar distribution of different morphotypes and correlation between the morphotype and bioﬁlm formation ( not shown ) .

3.2. Scanning electron microscopy and bioﬁlm formation on glass slides
The electron microscopy of bioﬁlms adhered to glass slides conﬁrmed the ability of BDAR , RDAR and SBAM strains to form differentially organized bioﬁlms . 
Cells of the BDAR morphotype were organized in microcolonies connected with a fragile extracelullar matrix which did not allow the formatio of mature bioﬁlms ( Fig. 3a ) . 
RDAR strains were the most efﬁcient in bioﬁlm formation and cells of this morphotype were enclosed in a compact meshwork of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose ( Fig. 3b ) . 
SBAM strains formed voluminous bioﬁlms on glass slides with cells embedded in a dense glycocalyx composed of capsular polysaccharides ( Fig. 3c ) .

3.3. Bioﬁlm formation and presence of SGI1
We have described recently that multidrug resistant SGI1 positive S. Typhimurium strains are characterized by the absence of STM0517 -- 0529 genes for anaerobic allantoin utilization . 
Similar if not identical strains which lack the SGI1 can be found also among antibiotic sensitive strains ( Matiasovicova et al. , 2007 ) . 
Consequently , we hypothesized that the comparison of STM0517 -- 0529 genes negative strains differing only in the presence of SGI1 as determined by PCR might allow us to assess the role of SGI1 in the bioﬁlm formation . 
Nineteen STM0517 -- 0529 genes and SGI1 negative strains formed bioﬁlms at an average value of 0.88 0.47 while 47 STM0517 -- 0529 genes negative but SGI1 positive strains formed bioﬁlm at an average value of 1.16 0.41 . 
When these values were compared by the t-test , they were found to be signiﬁcantly different ( P < 0.05 ) con-ﬁrming the contribution of SGI1 to bioﬁlm formation . 
4. Discussion
In this study , we investigated in particular S. Typhimurium ﬁeld strains for their ability to form bioﬁlms and to produce the extracellular structures essential for adhesion to solid surfaces . 
Since multiple authors have described a correlation between colony morphology and bioﬁlm formation ( Gerstel and Romling , 2003 ; Romling , 2005 ; Kim and Wei , 2007 ) in S. Typhimurium as well as in other Salmonella serovars , this was used as a main phenotypic criterion for strain characterization . 
In S. Typhimurium four different morphotypes were detected in all . 
Three of them ( SAW , BDAR and RDAR ) have already been described in different deﬁned mutants ( Romling et al. , 2000 ) as well as in strains isolated from various sources ( Solano et al. , 2002 ; Jain and Chen , 2006 ) . 
The last one , SBAM , has not been described in detail so far . 
Strains belonging to the SBAM morphotype were capable of bioﬁlm formation despite the fact that they produced neither cellulose nor curli ﬁmbriae . 
Their ability to adhere was solely dependent on the overproduction of capsular polysaccharide as conﬁrmed by ELLA assay ( Leriche et al. , 2000 ) and electron microscopy . 
The electron microscopy of SBAM strains conﬁrmed the presence of capsular polysaccharide in the form of condensed granules and ﬁlaments typical for highly hydrated structures like colanic acid ( Prigent-Combaret et al. , 2000 ) . 
Although the capsular polysaccharide has been described as a common component of Salmonella bioﬁlms ( Anriany et al. , 2001 ; De Rezende et al. , 2005 ) , its role has been considered as less important . 
Despite this , strains forming smooth mucous colonies with adhesive abilities and which ﬂuoresced poorly on calcoﬂuor plates , i.e. similar to the SBAM strains of S. Typhimurium , have also been described in S. Enteritidis ( Solano et al. , 2002 ) . 
We also observed strains of SBA morphotype in three strains of serovar Montevideo and one strain belonging to serovar Derby . 
Consistent with previous studies ( White and Surette , 2006 ; Kim and Wei , 2007 ) , the most efﬁcient bioﬁlm formation was observed among the strains belonging to the phage type DT104 forming a RDAR morphotype which correlates with bioﬁlm formation in Enterobacteriaceae in general ( Romling , 2005 ) . 
When all the strains were differentiated according to the presence or absence of genes for anaerobic allantoin utilization ( STM0517-0529 ) and SGI1 ( Matiasovicova et al. , 2007 ) , i.e. regardless of their phage-type , we observed a positive effect of SGI1 on bioﬁlm formation in S. Typhimurium . 
Our observations may correlate with the ﬁndings of Golding et al. ( 2007 ) who reported that the acquisition of SGI1 led to the increased expression of sthE , a putative major ﬁmbrial subunit in S. Typhimurium LT2 . 
The SGI1 , besides the antibiotic resistance also increases the bioﬁlm formation potential of host strains . 
This improved ability can enhance the capability of these strains to survive in the environment and consequently to more frequently infect new hosts .
