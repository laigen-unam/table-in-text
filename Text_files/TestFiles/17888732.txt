Abstract 
Norepinephrine promotes the growth of Salmonella enterica in vitro in iron-restricted conditions imposed by the iron-binding proteins serum transferrin and egg-white ovotransferrin by facilitating the release of bound iron and subsequent uptake by the bacteria . 
Moreover , signiﬁcantly increased colonisation and systemic spread were observed in mouse and chicken models of S. enterica infection following pre-treatment of animals with norepinephrine . 
Both ent and tonB mutants showed no growth promotion by norepinephrine either in liquid medium containing serum or on plates containing hens ' egg-white , indicating that the process is dependent both on the ability to synthesise enterobactin and on TonB-dependent uptake of iron . 
An entS mutant ( formerly designated ybdA ) and an iroB mutant behaved as wild type in both assays , showing that neither secretion of enterobactin nor conversion of enterobactin to salmochelin S4 is necessary for the effect . 
On the other hand , the presence of mutations in fes or iroD resulted in loss of growth promotion by norepinephrine in both assays . 
Since the fes and iroD genes encode enzymes that hydrolyse enterobactin and salmochelin S4 respectively to monomers , these data suggest that excretion of monomeric forms of these siderophores may be important for the uptake of iron released by norepinephrine from transferrin or ovotransferrin . 
A similar pattern of behaviour was observed with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in a mouse model of infection ; treatment of animals with norepinephrine before intragastric challenge resulted in increased intestinal colonisation and systemic spread of both wild-type and entS mutant strains , while the fes mutant was signiﬁcantly attenuated in vivo . 
This suggests that excretion of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine may be essential for norepinephrine-dependent growth promotion in the iron-restricted environment of the infected host . 
Unlike the situation in vitro , however , tonB mutants of S. enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis behaved the same as wild type in mouse and chick infection models , respectively , suggesting that norepinephrine-dependent growth stimulation may also occur by TonB-independent uptake of the enterobactin precursor 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid .

Introduction
Salmonella enterica uses a variety of mechanisms to acquire iron . 
It has long been known that , like most members of the Enterobacteriaceae , S. enterica uses the catecholate siderophore enterobactin and its stable breakdown products , the monomeric , dimeric and linear trimeric forms of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine ( DHBS1 -- 3 ) , to obtain iron ( Yancey et al. , 1979 ) . 
More recent reports , however , suggest that salmochelin S4 , a doubly C-glucosylated enterobactin derivative , is a major side-rophore of S. enterica strains ( Bister et al. , 2004 ; Hantke et al. , 2003 ) . 
As well as the primary molecule S4 , several linear glucosylated hydrolysis products , SX ( monomeric ) , S1 and S5 ( dimeric ) and S2 ( trimeric ) , analogous to those of enterobactin have also been identiﬁed . 
In addition , some Salmonella strains possess a high pathogenicity island that encodes the catecholate siderophore yersinia-bactin and its uptake system ( Oelschlaeger et al. , 2003 ) . 
Some strains also make the hydroxamate siderophore aerobactin ( Colonna et al. , 1985 ; McDougall and Neilands , 1984 ; Rabsch and Reissbrodt , 1985 ) . 
Moreover , S. enterica can use siderophores made by other micro-organisms . 
For example , the fungal siderophore ferri-chrome can provide iron for growth in iron-limited environments ( Luckey et al. , 1972 ) , as can the ferrioxamines , siderophores produced by various bacterial species ( Kingsley et al. , 1999 ; Reissbrodt et al. , 1996 ) . 
In addition , the primary metabolites a-ketoacids and a-hydroxyacids may act as surrogate siderophores for Salmonella ( Kingsley et al. , 1996 ; Reissbrodt et al. , 1997 ) . 
There is increasing evidence in the literature that mammalian signalling molecules such as norepinephrine ( NE ) can inﬂuence the growth , and in some cases the virulence properties , of a number of pathogenic bacteria ( Alverdy et al. , 2000 ; Belay and Sonnenfeld , 2002 ; Cogan et al. , 2007 ; Freestone et al. , 2002 ; Kinney et al. , 2000 ; Lyte et al. , 1996 , 1997 ; Lyte and Ernst , 1992 ; Neal et al. , 2001 ; Reissbrodt et al. , 2002 ; Roberts et al. , 2002 ; Walters and Sperandio , 2006 ) . 
The mechanism by which growth of Escherichia coli strains is stimulated involves facilitation by NE of bacterial iron acquisition from the mammalian iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin ( Freestone et al. , 2000 ) and the process appears to require the ability to produce enterobactin ( Burton et al. , 2002 ; Freestone et al. , 2000 , 2003 ) . 
Our recent studies with S. enterica , however , suggest that the ability to take up enterobactin or salmochelin S4 is not necessary for growth stimulation by NE , either in vitro or in vivo . 
Mutants defective in the expression of ironregulated outer-membrane proteins FepA and IroN that act as receptors for enterobactin and salmochelin S4 can not use these siderophores as sources of iron , but nevertheless show growth stimulation by NE in vitro and , moreover , behave essentially the same as wild-type strains in experimental infection models ( Rabsch et al. , 
2003 ; Williams et al. , 2006 ) . 
In the present paper , we demonstrate that pre-treatment of animals with NE signiﬁcantly increased colonisation and systemic spread of S. enterica in mouse and chicken infection models . 
On the basis of these data we propose that low-molecular-weight stable breakdown products , such as DHBS or SX , and precursors , such as DHBA , rather than enterobactin or salmochelin S4 themselves , promote the growth of S. enterica both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of NE . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
The relevant genotypes and sources of the bacterial strains used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 
Mutations in genes entS , fes and iroD were made using the protocol developed in the laboratory of Barry Wanner ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
Chloramphenicol resistance ( cat ) or kanamycin resistance ( kan ) cassettes were inserted and the resulting insertion mutations were transduced into S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC14028 using high-frequency generalised transducing phage P22 HT105/1 int-201 ( Maloy , 1990 ) to give single-mutant strains . 
Elimination of the antibiotic resistance cassette from the DE ( iroD ) : : kan allele was performed by transformation of the mutant strain with the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 as described previously ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
The presence and/or deletion of resistance cassettes were veriﬁed by appropriate PCR . 
Growth-promotion tests
The presence of growth-promoting compounds in sterile culture supernatants of S. enterica strains was determined in standard siderophore assays on Vogel -- Bonner medium supplemented with 200 mM 2,20-bipyr-idyl as described previously ( Reissbrodt and Rabsch , 1988 ) . 
The following indicator strains were used . 
Strain AN90-60 carries a mutation in entD , encoding a product that is a component of the enterobactin synthetase complex ; this strain can grow in the iron-restricted conditions of the bioassay if supplemented with enterobactin , but not in the presence of enterobactin precursors DHBS or DHBA , which , because it is an entD mutant , it can not convert to enterobactin . 
Strain AN193-60 is an entA mutant , defective in the enzyme 2,3-dihydro-2 ,3 - dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase ; it can grow in iron-restricted conditions if supplemented with enterobactin or its precursors DHBS and DHBA . 
Note that these two E. coli strains naturally lack IroN and so can not use salmochelin S4 to acquire iron . 
S. Typhimurium strain WR1727 has mutations in fep and iroN and so lacks the iron-regulated outermembrane proteins that act as receptors for enterobac-tin ( FepA and IroN ) and salmochelin ( IroN ) ; it does , however , express Cir and so is able to take up DHBA , DHBS and SX , the monomeric component of salmo-chelin S4 . 
Strain SR1001 carries a tonB mutation and so can not utilise any compound the uptake of which is TonB-dependent , including enterobactin and salmochelin S4 and their breakdown products ; it does , however , grow in the presence of DHBA , the uptake of which by Salmonella is TonB-independent ( Kingsley et al. , 1996 ) . 
Growth promotion of enterobactin-proﬁcient strains of S. enterica by NE was determined on egg-white nutrient medium as described previously ( Kingsley et al. , 1999 ; Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) . 
Co-culture experiments
To determine growth promotion in co-culture , bacterial strains were inoculated at approximately 10 CFU / 2 ml in SAPI salts medium ( Lyte and Ernst , 1992 ) containing bovine serum at 30 % v/v ( serum-SAPI medium ) and supplemented with 50 mg/ml NE . 
Cultures ( 1 ml ) of strains ATCC14028 ( wild type ) and WR1805 ( entS ) were enclosed within dialysis membrane , placed in 5-ml cultures of various test strains and incubated overnight at 37 1C . 
The enclosed strains grew well ( to 4108 CFU/ml ) in these conditions . 
In addition , 1 ml aliquots of sterile serum-SAPI medium containing 50 mg/ml NE and further supplemented with DHBS ( 150 mg/ml ) or DHBA ( 100 mg/ml ) were enclosed in dialysis membrane , placed in 5-ml cultures of the tonB mutant strain WR1174 and incubated overnight at 37 1C . 
No growth occurred in the uninoculated medium containing DHBS or DHBA . 
Experimental infections
Female BALB/c mice , 6 -- 8 weeks old and housed in speciﬁc-pathogen-free conditions , were infected with S. Typhimurium strain ATCC14028 and its derivatives essentially as described previously ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ; Williams et al. , 2006 ) . 
Brieﬂy , mice were fed intragastrically with NE at the concentrations indicated in 1 ml of water the day before infection ; bacterial strains for infection were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth without shaking at 37 1C , harvested by centrifugation and suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline for intragastric administration to mice ( approximately 10 CFU per animal in 1 ml of suspension ) . 
Samples of 4 liver were aseptically removed from mice that had died or from mice sacriﬁced 7 days after infection , and assayed for bacterial load as described previously ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ; Williams et al. , 2006 ) . 
Colonies were subcultured on LB agar containing appropriate antibiotics to conﬁrm recovery of the inoculating strain

Infections of speciﬁc-pathogen-free White Leghorn chicks , hatched at the facilities of the Friedrich-Lo ̈fﬂer - Institute , Jena Branch , Germany , from eggs obtained from Charles River Deutschland GmbH , Extertal , Germany , were experimentally infected essentially as described previously ( Methner et al. , 1995 ; Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) . 
Experimental groups were kept in separate rooms with feed and drinking water both available ad libitum . 
The virulence of strain SE147Nal and its tonB r derivative WR1529 was tested in highly susceptible 5-day-old chicks with or without pre-treatment with NE . 
To enable this to be performed in such young birds , their resistance to Salmonella organisms was increased by administering a competitive exclusion culture ( Broilact , Orion , Finland ) by crop instillation s on day 1 of life , as is common practice in commercial ﬂocks . 
From day 2 of life until the end of the experiment , birds received NE at the concentrations indicated twice daily by crop instillation in a volume of 0.1 ml . 
On day 5 of life , the chicks were challenged with Salmonella strains at a dose of 10 CFU/bird in a 7 volume of 0.1 ml . 
The ability of the strains to colonise the gut and to invade internal organs was evaluated on day 4 after administration of the bacterial strains by determining viable counts in homogenised samples of the caeca and livers of infected birds as described previously ( Methner et al. , 1995 ; Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) . 
In separate experiments , doses of NE used in the study were tested in the absence of bacterial challenge for their potential to produce any adverse effects in treated animals . 
No obvious pathomorphological signs of intestinal damage or inﬂammation were detected , and NE-treated animals were not observed to be in any more distress than untreated animals . 
For the purposes of statistical analysis , a viable count of log10o1 .47 ( the limit for direct plate detection ) obtained from a sample that became positive only after enrichment was rated as log10 1/4 1.0 , while a sample that yielded no bacterial growth after enrichment was rated as log10 1/4 0 . 
Data were evaluated by variance analysis . 
P values of o0 .05 were regarded as statistically signiﬁcant ( software from Statgraphics Plus , Inc. , Rockville , Maryland , USA ) . 
Results
Involvement of enterobactin and salmochelin S4 in growth stimulation by NE in serum-SAPI medium
The effects of NE on bacterial growth were ﬁrst reported by Lyte and co-workers , who used a nutrientpoor minimal salts medium containing bovine serum ( serum-SAPI medium ) and inocula of test strains of approximately 200 CFU/ml ( Lyte et al. , 1996 ; Lyte and Ernst , 1992 ) . 
Most bacterial species tested in this way reached a density of approximately 10 CFU/ml in this 5 medium after 24 h incubation , but supplementation of serum-SAPI medium with 50 mM NE permitted growth to densities of 4108 CFU/ml ( Cogan et al. , 2007 ; Freestone et al. , 1999 , 2002 ; Neal et al. , 2001 ; Roberts et al. , 2002 ) . 
We have used this experimental approach to determine the role of enterobactin , salmochelin S4 and various precursors and degradation products in NE stimulation of the growth of S. enterica ( Table 2 ) . 
Thus , while the wild-type S. Typhimurium strain ATCC14028 grew well in serum-SAPI in the presence of NE , the ent mutant strain TA2700 , by contrast , was unable to grow , indicating that the ability of S. enterica strains to synthesise enterobactin is necessary for growth stimulation by NE in serum-containing liquid medium , as has been demonstrated for E. coli ( Burton et al. , 2002 ; Freestone et al. , 2003 ) . 
However , neither secretion nor uptake of enterobactin appears to be essential for growth stimulation by NE in serum-containing liquid medium . 
Strain WR1805 harbours a mutation in the gene entS that encodes an inner-membrane protein responsible for transporting newly synthesised enterobactin out of the cell ( Furrer et al. , 2002 ) . 
Strain WR1727 is defective in expression of the two outer-membrane proteins FepA and IroN that function as enterobactin receptors ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) . 
Both these strains behaved like wild type with respect to growth stimulation by NE ( Table 2 ) . 
Note that IroN also acts as receptor for salmochelin S4 ( Hantke et al. , 2003 ) , and so strain WR1727 is unable to use either enterobactin or salmochelin S4 as sources of iron . 
Strain WR1729 , which additionally lacks the ability to C-glucosylate enterobactin to form salmochelin S4 ( Hantke et al. , 2003 ; Fischbach et al. , 2005 ) , also showed wild-type behaviour in serum-SAPI medium . 
These data suggest that neither IroB-dependent synthesis nor IroN-dependent uptake of salmochelin S4 is essential for the process of growth stimulation by NE . 
Secretion of catecholate precursors and degradation products and their role in growth stimulation by NE 
So what is required for growth stimulation by NE , if not the major siderophores enterobactin and salmochelin S4 ? 
To address this question , we analysed sterilised culture supernatants of strains grown in serum-SAPI supplemented with NE for their ability to promote the growth of a number of indicator strains in standard siderophore bioassay conditions . 
Strain AN90-60 was used as the indicator for enterobactin , strain AN193-60 for enterobactin , DHBA and DHBS , strain WR1727 for the monomeric components of enterobactin and salmo-chelin S4 , and strain SR1001 for DHBA ( Table 3 ) . 
As expected , culture supernatants of wild-type strain ATCC14028 contained enterobactin , but there were als detectable levels of the enterobactin precursor DHBA and of monomeric degradation products of enterobactin and/or salmochelin S4 . 
Sterilised WR1805 culture supernatant was unable to promote the growth of the enterobactin indicator , but was able to cross-feed the two indicator strains that could utilise DHBS . 
These observations support the hypothesis that enterobactin 
Cultures were inoculated with approximately 10 CFU/ml of each test strain and incubated overnight at 37 1C : indicates poor or no growth ( o104 CFU/ml ) ; 7 indicates growth to approximately 10 CFU/ml ; + indicates growth to 6 4108 CFU/ml . 
Identical results were obtained when SAPI medium was supplemented with bovine , human or chicken serum . 
b NE was added at 50 mg/ml . 
c Ferrous ammonium sulphate was added at 100 mM . 
accumulates in the cytoplasm of the entS mutant due to failure of the export system and is then hydrolysed by Fes to DHBS , which is excreted by a pathway different from the EntS transporter . 
Consistent with this is the observation that culture supernatants of strain WR1925 , which carries the fes mutation in combination with entS , showed signiﬁcantly lower levels of growth promotion of the indicator strains WR1727 than supernatants of the isogenic fes strain WR1805 . 
+ It is to be expected that some of the newly synthesised enterobactin will be converted to salmochelin S4 by IroB-catalysed C-glucosylation ( Hantke et al. , 2003 ; Fischbach et al. , 2005 ) . 
Like enterobactin , salmochelin S4 is degraded by esterases to linear multimeric and monomeric forms ; the salmochelin equivalent of Fes is IroD ( Hantke et al. , 2003 ; Bister et al. , 2004 ; Zhu et al. , 2005 ) . 
Culture supernatants of strains containing the iroD mutation , either alone ( WR1744 ) or in combination with fes ( WR1810 ) , showed essentially identical levels of growth promotion of all four indicator strains to the supernatants of the isogenic iroD strains . 
These + data suggest that salmochelin S4 and its breakdown products are relatively minor components of the biological activity in the culture supernatants , but spectrophotometric analysis would be required to conﬁrm this . 
Strains containing the fes mutation either alone ( WR1782 ) or in combination with entS ( WR1925 ) grew signiﬁcantly less well than isogenic fes strains in serum - + SAPI medium supplemented with NE ( Table 2 ) . 
Moreover , strains containing the iroD mutation alone ( WR1744 ) or in combination with fes ( WR1810 ) grew poorly in serum-SAPI medium supplemented with NE . 
Supplementation of the medium with DHBS or DHBA , however , resulted in growth of strain WR1810 in serumSAPI medium containing NE ( Table 2 ) . 
Interestingly , tonB mutant strain WR1174 did not grow in serum-SAPI medium supplemented with NE . 
Similar results were observed with S. Enteritidis strain SE147Nal , which grew well in serum-SAPI supplemenr ted with NE , and its tonB mutant derivative WR1529 , which did not ( Table 2 ) . 
These data suggest that NE-dependent growth promotion is due to a TonB-dependent process . 
Consistent with this , NE was not able to stimulate the growth of strain WR1174 when serum-SAPI medium was additionally supplemented with DHBS . 
By contrast , supplementation with DHBA , which can supply iron to S. enterica strains in a TonB-independent fashion ( Kingsley et al. , 1996 ) , resulted in promotion of growth of strain WR1174 in serum-SAPI medium containing NE . 
These data strongly imply that NE stimulation of growth can occur by a process involving DHBA in the absence of TonB . 
Interestingly , most strains tested secreted small but detectable amounts of DHBA ( Table 3 ) , as determined by the ability to cross-feed the indicator strain SR1001 .

Growth on egg-white agar plates
Kingsley et al. ( 1999 ) previously reported the use of egg-white medium to test for growth promotion of enterobactin-producing strains of Salmonella by compounds , including siderophores , exogenously added on impregnated ﬁlter paper discs . 
The presence of ovotransferrin in egg-white is able to restrict the growth of the bacterial lawn , even in the face of endogenous siderophore production . 
Addition of ﬁlter paper discs impregnated with NE , however , resulted in zones of growth of ATCC14028 around the discs , the sizes of which correlated with the amount of NE added ( Fig. 1a ) . 
No such growth zones were observed with the tonB strain WR1174 ( Fig. 1b ) . 
Moreover , the ability of NE to stimulate growth on egg-white agar corresponded with its ability to stimulate growth in serum-SAPI medium ( Table 2 ) . 
Our interpretation of these data is that NE facilitates the release of iron from ovotransferrin in the egg-white agar as we have previously proposed it does from transferrin in serum-SAPI medium , and that the iron is then taken up by a TonB-dependent process to promote bacterial growth . 
The process requires enterobactin synthesis ( as indicated by the fact that TA2700 was not stimulated by NE , Table 2 ) , but not enterobactin secretion ( since WR1805 did grow on egg-white agar in the presence of NE ) . 
Rather , as suggested by growth experiments in serum-containing medium , it is the ability to degrade enterobactin to DHBS , and possibly salmochelin S4 to SX , that appears to be important , since strains with mutations in fes and iroD were not able to grow on egg-white agar in the presence of NE ( Table 2 ) .

Filter paper discs were impregnated with 20 , 40 , 60 or 80 mg of NE as indicated . 
Growth zones around ﬁlter paper discs were indicative of growth promotion . 
Co-culture in serum-SAPI medium
As indicated in Table 2 , wild-type strain ATCC14028 and the entS mutant WR1805 were both able to grow in serum-SAPI medium supplemented with NE . 
Moreover , these two strains were able to support the growth in coculture of various ent , fes and iroD mutant strains that were unable to grow in pure culture in this medium ( Table 4 ) . 
The tonB mutant WR1174 was also stimulated to grow in co-culture with entS strain WR1805 , but the extent of growth was relatively poor by comparison with the strains mentioned above . 
Crossfeeding tests demonstrated that WR1805 excretes measurable amounts of DHBA ( Table 3 ) ; thus , while DHBS or SX may be responsible for growth stimulation of the tonB strains tested in the co-culture assay , it is + feasible to propose that the small amount of DHBA excreted by WR1805 may support the observed low level of growth stimulation of the tonB mutant WR1174 . 
Consistent with this is the observation that addition of DHBA to sterile medium within the dialysis membrane resulted in growth of the tonB mutant strain WR1174 in the surrounding culture , while addition of DHBS , the uptake of which is TonB-dependent , did not ( Table 4 ) 
Growth of the test strains is indicated by + , indicating growth to 4108 CFU/ml , and 7 , representing growth to approximately 10 CFU/ml .

Experimental infections
Pre-treatment of chicks with NE before challenge with wild-type S. enterica serovar Enteritidis strain SE147Nal resulted in a signiﬁcant and dramatic r increase in both caecal colonisation and systemic spread to the liver . 
Fig. 2a illustrates an experiment in which colonisation of the caecum was enhanced by approximately 3 and 5 log10 orders in birds given twice daily 0.1-ml doses of freshly made 0.8 and 8.0 mg/l NE solutions , respectively , while translocation to the liver was enhanced 40 - and 300-fold , respectively . 
Fig. 2b shows another experiment in which infection levels by SE147Nal were somewhat higher in the control group r ( i.e. chicks not pre-treated with NE ) than in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2a , but nevertheless colonisation of the caecum was enhanced by approximately 10-fold and translocation to the liver was enhanced 4-fold in birds given twice daily 0.1-ml doses of 1.6 mg/l NE . 
Somewhat unexpectedly , the tonB mutant derivative WR1529 , in which TonB-dependent iron transport systems are inactive , behaved the same as wild type in birds given twice daily 0.1-ml doses of 1.6 mg/l NE . 
Intestinal colonisation was enhanced by approximately 2 log10 orders and systemic spread to the liver was enhanced 3-fold ( Fig. 2b ) . 
In the mouse infection model , too , pre-treatment of animals with 1-ml doses of a 16 mg/ml solution of NE resulted in marked enhancements over non-pre-treated controls in intestinal colonisation and systemic spread of both wild-type S. Typhimurium strain ATCC14028 and its tonB mutant derivative WR1174 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The entS derivative WR1805 behaved essentially identically , indicating that secretion of enterobactin per se is not required for the NE effect in vivo . 
On the other hand , fes mutant strain WR1782 was signiﬁcantly attenuated in both groups of mice .

Discussion
The ability of bacterial pathogens to acquire iron from various complexed forms in the host , such as lactoferrin , transferrin , haem , etc. , is generally believed to be an important aspect in pathogenicity . 
S. enterica serovars synthesise the catecholate siderophores entero-bactin and salmochelin S4 , but . 
while both have high afﬁnities for ferric iron ( Bister et al. , 2004 ; Harris et al. , 1979 ) , evidence for roles in pathogenicity is equivocal . 
Thus , Benjamin and co-workers proposed that the ability of S. Typhimurium to produce enterobacti was not a virulence factor in mouse typhoid ( Benjamin et al. , 1985 ) , while others have reported that mutants defective in enterobactin biosynthesis were signiﬁcantly attenuated in mice ( Hoiseth and Stocker , 1981 ; Yancey et al. , 1979 ) and in monocyte cell culture ( Gorbacheva et al. , 2001 ) . 
Moreover , although the association of salmochelin synthesis with pathogenic serovars of S. enterica and with uropathogenic E. coli ( Hantke et al. , 2003 ) may suggest a role in virulence , an iroBC mutant , in which glucosylation of enterobactin to salmochelin S4 was deﬁcient , was not affected in virulence for mice compared with wild type ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) , suggesting that salmochelin is not required for full virulence . 
To add to the debate , mutant strains of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis lacking outermembrane protein receptors for enterobactin and salmochelin S4 ( FepA and IroN ) were also not attenuated in relevant mouse and chick infection models ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ; Williams et al. , 2006 ) . 
On the other hand , a triple mutant of S. Typhimurium lacking the three iron-regulated outer-membrane proteins , FepA , IroN and Cir , expressed by this serovar was signiﬁcantly attenuated in the mouse model . 
Since all three proteins can act as receptors for DHBS , as well as various other natural and synthetic catecholate compounds , it was suggested that the virulence of fepA iroN mutants may be due to their ability to use DHBS as a source of iron ( Rabsch et al. , 2003 ; Williams et al. , 2006 ) . 
NE is proposed to facilitate the transfer of iron from transferrin and similar iron-binding proteins to bacteria , thus stimulating microbial growth in severely ironrestricted environments ( Freestone et al. , 2000 ) . 
In the present paper , we report the use of two in vitro systems , growth in serum-SAPI medium ( which contains transferrin ) and growth on egg-white agar plates ( in which iron is predominantly bound to ovotransferrin ) , to study the process . 
Both models indicate that , while entero-bactin biosynthesis is absolutely required for the NE effect , conversion of enterobactin to salmochelin S4 by IroB or enterobactin secretion via EntS is not . 
Strains lacking Fes and IroD , the enzymes that hydrolyse enterobactin and salmochelin S4 to DHBS and SX , respectively , did not show growth stimulation by NE in either system . 
These data clearly support the hypothesis that DHBS and SX , rather than enterobactin or salmochelin S4 , are catecholate molecules responsible for uptake of iron , the release of which from transferrin and ovotransferrin is facilitated by NE . 
The situation observed in these two in vitro models is broadly similar to that seen in vivo in the mouse infection model . 
Pretreatment of mice with NE resulted in signiﬁcant enhancement in the bacterial burden of infection by S. Typhimurium strains following intragastric inoculation , in terms of both intestinal colonisation ( Williams et al. , 2006 ) and systemic spread ( data shown here ) . 
Disruption of enterobactin secretion by mutation of the entS gene had no effect on the ability of NE pre-treatment to enhance infection . 
Disruption of enterobactin breakdown to DHBS by mutation of fes , however , resulted in attenuation of the strain and lack of the ability of NE to enhance infection . 
The catecholate receptors FepA , IroN and Cir belong to a family of transport proteins that depend on the activity of TonB and the ancillary proteins ExbBD ( Braun and Hantke , 1991 ; Skare et al. , 1993 ) . 
In our two in vitro assay systems , the ability of NE to promote bacterial growth in the presence of serum transferrin or ovotransferrin is TonB dependent , consistent with a role for DHBS in the process . 
When we move to consideration of the behaviour of tonB mutants in animal infection models , however , the situation appears more complex . 
Here we conﬁrm our previous report ( Williams et al. , 2006 ) with S. Typhimurium in mice and demonstrate for the ﬁrst time with S. Enteritidis in chicks that pre-treatment of animals with NE before bacterial challenge signiﬁcantly enhances both intestina colonisation and systemic spread of the infecting organisms . 
This is fully in agreement with a previous study ( Lyte and Bailey , 1997 ) in which markedly increased levels ( 3 -- 4 log10 orders ) of commensal intest-inal coliforms were observed in mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine , a drug that destroys nerve term-inals of the sympathetic nervous system and results in release of NE into the bloodstream and then the gut . 
Surprisingly , however , tonB mutants of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were observed to behave like the parental strains in the mouse and chick models , respectively . 
It has previously been reported that mutation of tonB attenuated S. Typhimurium for infection of mice by the intragastric route ( although not the intraperitoneal route , Tsolis et al. , 1996 ) . 
Our S. Typhimurium tonB mutant similarly showed a degree of attenuation in mice compared with wild type , but interestingly pre-treatment of the animals with NE before intragastric infection induced levels of colonisation and systemic spread that were of the same order of magnitude as the wild-type strain . 
No signiﬁcant attenuation of the S. Enteritidis tonB mutant was observed for chick infections . 
There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy in behaviour of tonB mutants in vitro and in vivo . 
First , it is possible that the role of NE in vivo is not primarily to facilitate iron uptake but to act as a signalling molecule , as has been reported for Bordetella ( Anderson and Armstrong , 2006 ) . 
Experiments to test this hypothesis are currently in progress in our laboratories . 
Second , it may be that in the absence of TonB other similar proteins may supply the energy for active iron transport in vivo . 
It has long been known , for example , that TolAQR can complement the TonB -- ExbBD system with respect to the uptake of colicins ( Braun , 1989 ; Braun and Herrmann , 1993 ) , although this is not very efﬁcient with regard to iron transport . 
It is difﬁcult to understand , moreover , why such complementation does not also occur in vitro in the context of serum-SAPI medium or egg-white agar . 
A third possibility is the existence of TonB-indepen-dent iron transport involving DHBA as the iron chelator . 
DHBA is a precursor of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine , tryptophan and phenylalanine , as well as of the catecholate siderophores enterobactin and sal-mochelin S4 . 
The intracellular pool of DHBA and the amount excreted from cells are likely to vary considerably depending on the nutrient status of the external medium . 
Genetic background may also be important ; for example , loss of the PAI II ( leuX ) pathogenicity island from the uropathogenic strain E. coli 536 resulted in enhanced excretion of DHBA ( Ritter et al. , 1995 ) . 
Most strains we have tested excrete detectable levels of the precursor molecule DHBA , whether or not they also secrete enterobactin or excrete DHBS . 
Indeed , judging by the observation of signiﬁcantly larger growth zones of the DHBA indicator strain in standard siderophore assays , our tonB mutant strain appeared to produce more DHBA than other strains . 
Such levels are presumably insufﬁcient to allow the growth of tonB mutants in serum-SAPI medium or on egg-white agar . 
Addition of exogenous DHBA at 100 mg/ml did result in the growth of these mutants in serum-SAPI medium in the presence of NE , but we have not observed growth promotion of any strains by DHBA on egg-white agar . 
This may perhaps be because DHBA does not have a high enough afﬁnity for iron to compete with ovotransferrin in this medium , or possibly because , in order to act as an iron source , DHBA has to complex with NE or other iron-binding molecules such as a-keto - and a-hydroxy-acids produced under iron-restricted conditions ( Reissbrodt et al. , 1997 ) . 
Similar considerations apply in the context of animal infections , where , of course , DHBA from commensal bacteria may play an important role in colonisation and spread of pathogens . 
The data presented here demonstrate that even relatively low levels of secreted DHBA may be sufﬁcient to supply iron ( as the sole source in tonB mutants and possibly in addition to DHBS in tonB strains ) for productive + infection to occur in the presence of NE . 
It has been proposed that increased release of NE during stress may contribute to trauma-induced sepsis in patients undergoing surgery ( Freestone et al. , 2002 ) and to greater susceptibility to intestinal infection in farm animals undergoing transportation and marketing ( Toscano et al. , 2007 ) . 
The data presented in the present paper suggest a mechanism for these phenomena in which low-molecular-weight precursors and breakdown products of catecholate siderophores may play a crucial role .
