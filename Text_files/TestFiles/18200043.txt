An additional layer of potential speciﬁcity and regulation is provided by adaptor proteins , that enhance or alter the substrate-recognition properties of AAA þ proteases ( Dougan et al , 2002 ; Baker and Sauer , 2006 ) . 
The ClpXP and Lon AAA þ proteases have been implicated in bacterial virulence ( Yamamoto et al , 2001 ; Frees et al , 2003 ; Takaya et al , 2003 ; Kwon et al , 2004 ) and in the degradation of transcriptional regulators that control expression of virulence gene ( Takaya et al , 2005 ) . 
MgtC is a virulence factor common to several intracellular pathogens that plays a key role in intramacrophage survival ( Alix and Blanc-Potard , 2007 ) . 
MgtC was ﬁrst described in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) where it is required for intramacrophage multiplication and long-term systemic infection in mice ( Blanc-Potard and Groisman , 1997 ; Lawley et al , 2006 ) . 
MgtC is also a critical factor for the intramacrophage growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Brucella suis , Yersinia pestis and Burkholderia cenocepacia ( Buchmeier et al , 2000 ; Lavigne et al , 2005 ; Grabenstein et al , 2006 ; Maloney and Valvano , 2006 ) .

MgtC is a virulence factor common to several intracellular pathogens that is required for intramacrophage survival and growth in magnesium-depleted medium . 
In Salmonella enterica , MgtC is coexpressed with the MgtB magnesium transporter and transcription of the mgtCB operon is induced by magnesium deprivation . 
Despite the high level of mgtCB transcriptional induction in magnesium-depleted medium , the MgtC protein is hardly detected in a wildtype Salmonella strain . 
Here , we show that downregulation of MgtC expression is dependent on a hydrophobic peptide , MgtR , which is encoded by the mgtCB operon . 
Our results suggest that MgtR promotes MgtC degradation by the FtsH protease , providing a negative regulatory feedback . 
Bacterial two-hybrid assays demonstrate that MgtR interacts with the inner-membrane MgtC protein . 
We identiﬁed mutant derivatives of MgtR and MgtC that prevent both regulation and interaction between the two partners . 
In macrophages , overexpression of the MgtR peptide led to a decrease of the replication rate of Salmonella . 
This study highlights the role of peptides in bacterial regulatory mechanisms and provides a natural antagonist of the 
MgtC virulence factor .

Introduction
Bacteria have evolved sophisticated regulatory pathways to adapt to environmental changes . 
The control of protein stability allows the cell to adjust to changing conditions by changing the rate of turnover of proteins . 
Regulated proteo-lysis has been well characterized for few proteins , including proteins involved in stress response mechanisms ( Gottesman , 2003 ) . 
Whereas the complex ubiquitin ligase machinery provides a target for regulating proteolysis in eukaryotes , no ubiquitin tagging exists in bacteria . 
A small number of ATP-dependent proteases ( AAA þ proteases ) are responsible for degradation of speciﬁc proteins , frequently by

In S. typhimurium , the mgtC gene is carried by the SPI-3 pathogenicity island ( Blanc-Potard and Groisman , 1997 ) . 
The biochemical function of MgtC remains unknown and the role of MgtC might differ in host and non-host environments ( Rang et al , 2007 ) . 
Heterologous expression of MgtC protein in Xenopus laevis oocytes has signiﬁcant effect on cellular ion homeostasis via a modulation of eukaryotic Na , K - ATPase activity ( Günzel þ þ et al , 2006 ) . 
However , the physiological relevance of these results during bacterial infection is currently unknown . 
MgtC is also involved in adaptation to low-Mg environ-2 þ ments ( Alix and Blanc-Potard , 2007 ) . 
The regulation of mgtC in response to Mg deprivation has been well studied at the 2 þ transcriptional level in S. typhimurium . 
The S. typhimurium mgtC gene is co-transcribed with mgtB , encoding an Mg 2 þ transporter ( Snavely et al , 1991 ) . 
Both MgtC and MgtB are inner-membrane proteins . 
The mgtCB operon is regulated by the PhoP -- PhoQ two-component system and is highly induced by low Mg concentration ( Garcıa-Ve ́scovi et al , 1996 ) . 
In 2 þ addition , the mgtCB operon is also regulated at the transcriptional level by a PhoPQ-independent mechanism that depends on the secondary structure of the 50UTR ( Groisman et al , 2006 ) . 
The MgtC protein could be detected at short time 2 þ periods after Mg starvation ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ; Adkins et al , 2006 ) . 
Surprisingly , despite the high trans-criptional induction , MgtC is undetectable during prolonged Mg starvation in an mgtC mgtB strain , although large 2 þ þ þ amounts of MgtB are observed ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ) . 
However , MgtC was detected in an mgtC strain þ that lacks the mgtB sequence , suggesting that MgtC is not produced or is not stable in the presence of the MgtB protein ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ) . 
In the present study , we further investigated the regulation of MgtC expression . 
We demonstrate that the amount of MgtC protein is downregulated by a 30-amino-acid peptide that is encoded downstream of the mgtB gene . 
We show that this peptide , termed MgtR , interacts with MgtC in vivo and promotes the degradation of MgtC by the FtsH AAA þ protease . 
Identiﬁcation of MgtR highlights the regulatory role of peptides and very small proteins that are often missed in genomic and proteomic analyses .

Results
MgtC expression is negatively regulated by sequences 30 of mgtB Previous work has shown that even though the mgtCB operon is highly induced in low-Mg environment , the MgtB , but 2 þ not the MgtC , protein is detected in a wild-type Salmonella strain upon prolonged Mg starvation ( Moncrief and 2 þ Maguire , 1998 ) . 
In addition , it has been suggested that mgtB sequence has a negative effect on MgtC expression ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ) . 
To explain the role of mgtB on MgtC protein level , we have transformed an Escherichia coli strain , which does not contain the mgtCB operon , with plasmids containing only the mgtC gene ( pEG9094 ) or the entire mgtCB operon ( pEG9091 ) ( Figure 1A ) . 
Consistent with previous data , MgtC was clearly expressed from pEG9094 , but to a much lesser extent from pEG9091 ( Figure 1B ) . 
A frameshift mutation at the beginning of the mgtB sequence did not produce higher MgtC levels , indicating that the lack of 
MgtC expression from pEG9091 is not due to the production of MgtB protein per se , but rather to other elements in the mgtB sequence ( Figure 1B ) . 
This result agrees with the previous report that a functional MgtB protein was not required to repress MgtC expression ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ) . 
We carried out successive deletions on pEG9091 plasmid to characterize the DNA region responsible for down-regulation of MgtC expression ( Figure 1A ) . 
Deletions within the mgtB gene did not increase MgtC levels ( Figure 1B ) . 
However , a deletion of the region downstream of the mgtB coding region ( pEG9091 del4 ) gave a pattern similar to the one observed with pEG9094 , indicating that 0 the 3 region of mgtB is involved in the regulation of MgtC expression . 
A 150-bp region downstream of mgtB was subcloned into the pBBR1MCS vector plasmid , which is compatible with pEG9094 , to produce the pMgtR plasmid . 
The pMgtR plasmid was introduced in E. coli strain carrying pEG9094 . 
Western blot analysis clearly showed a decrease of MgtC expression in the presence of pMgtR but not the pBBR1MCS vector ( Figure 1C ) . 
This result indicates that the region downstream of mgtB acts in trans to regulate MgtC expression . 
Taken together , these results indicate that a small DNA region , 0 present at the 3 end of the mgtCB operon , negatively regulates the amount of MgtC protein .

MgtR : a peptide that downregulates MgtC expression 
The 150-bp regulatory region described above includes a 90-bp region ( position 3961428 -- 3961518 of the S. typhimurium LT2 genome ) that could encode a small RNA and/or an open reading frame ( ORF ) of 30 amino acids , preceded by a shine -- dalgarno consensus sequence ( Figure 2A ) . 
This sequence , which is not annotated in the S. typhimurium genome , was named mgtR ( GenBank accession number EU154350 ) . 
To distinguish between the RNA and protein hypotheses , we examined the phenotype of strains with several site-directed mutants in the pMgtR plasmid . 
First , qwe generated two mutations ( Mut 1 and Mut 2 ) that disrupt the predicted RNA secondary structure without changing the predicted amino-acid sequence ( Figure 2A ) . 
As shown in Figure 2B , regulation of MgtC expression was maintained in the presence of both mutations . 
Secondly , we performed mutagenesis of the initial ATG of the putative ORF ( Mut 3 ) or introduced a frameshift mutation ( Mut 4 ) , without changing the stability of the predicted RNA secondary structure

The band detected above MgtC appears non-speciﬁc since it is also found with E. coli strains or S. typhimurium strain NM14 .

The mgtR sequence belongs to the mgtCB operon and 
MgtC 
MgtR acts on MgtC at the post-transcriptional level The mgtCB operon is induced by growth in low-Mg 2 þ medium ( Figure 4A ) . 
To examine mgtR transcription , total RNA was extracted from wild-type S. typhimurium strain 14028s grown in NCE medium supplemented with 10 mM or 10 mM Mg . 
RT -- PCR experiments showed that , similarly to 2 þ mgtC , the mgtR gene is only transcribed in low-Mg condi-2 þ tions . 
In contrast , a non-PhoP-regulated gene , gapA , is tran-2 þ scribed in both low and high Mg ( Figure 4B ) . 
In addition , RT -- PCR fragments were ampliﬁed with primers belonging to mgtB and mgtR ( Figure 4B ) . 
Taken together , these results demonstrate that mgtR belongs to the mgtCB operon . 
The levels of MgtB protein were identical in the presence or absence of MgtR ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) , indicating that the effect of MgtR is speciﬁc for MgtC and does not affect MgtB . 
This result further suggests that MgtR does not act on the promoter sequences of the mgtCB operon . 
Accordingly , when the region upstream of mgtC , including mgtC promoter sequence and mgtC 50UTR , was fused to the lacZ gene ( Supplementary data ) , the b-galactosidase activity was independent of the presence of MgtR ( data not shown ) . 
Moreover , MgtC expression was regulated by MgtR when the mgtC coding sequence was under the control of the lac promoter ( data not shown ) . 
Cumulatively , these results indicate that MgtR acts on MgtC at the post-transcriptional level .

MgtR promotes MgtC degradation by FtsH protease
We have studied the stability of MgtC in an S. typhimurium DmgtR-mutant strain that harbours the inducible His6-MgtR peptide . 
Bacterial cultures were grown O/N in low-Mg 2 þ medium to induce MgtC expression . 
The transcription of mgtC was then stopped by shifting the bacteria to high-Mg medium . 
In addition , IPTG was simultaneously 2 þ added to induce the His6-MgtR synthesis . 
In a control experiment , the DmgtR strain harboured the pQE30 vector and did not express MgtR . 
The level of MgtC protein was evaluated at time points after the shift ( Figure 3C ) . 
In the presence of MgtR , MgtC was barely detected 4 h after the shift . 
On the other hand , MgtC was still detected 4 h after the shift in the absence of MgtR . 
This result demonstrates that MgtR promotes MgtC degradation , although through a relatively slow process . 
FtsH is a AAA þ protease that has been involved in the degradation of membrane proteins ( Ito and Akiyama , 2005 ) . 
To determine whether FtsH plays a role in MgtC degradation , we have studied the level of MgtC protein in the presence or absence of MgtR in an E. coli thermosensitive ftsH mutant or an isogenic wild-type strain . 
At the permissive temperature of 301C , the down-regulation of MgtC in the presence of MgtR is similar in the wild-type and ftsH mutant ( Figure 5 ) . 
However , at 421C , the regulation is clearly observed in the wild-type strain but not in the ftsH mutant ( Figure 5 ) . 
Hence , a functional FtsH protease is required to mediate the downregulation of MgtC expression in the presence of MgtR . 
To address the speciﬁcity of the FtsH protease , we have also used a clpX mutant of Salmonella ( Aldridge et al , 2003 ) . 
The regulation of MgtC by MgtR was similar in the wild-type strain and the clpX1HTn10dcam mutant ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . 
Taken together , these results indicate that MgtR assists MgtC to be degraded by the FtsH protease .

C-terminus . 
As expected , MgtR is found to be associated with the S. typhimurium membrane fraction ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . 
We carried out site-directed mutagenesis in the N - and C-terminal parts as well as in the transmembrane helix ( Figure 6A ) . 
We tested the ability of mutated peptides to regulate MgtC degradation . 
Mutations were carried out on the pMgtR plasmid ( Figure 6B ) or on the pQEMgtR plasmid ( Figure 6C ) . 
Results clearly showed that , among the 11 residues tested , only two residues abolished the degradation of MgtC and are therefore important for MgtR function ( Figure 6C ) . 
These mutations , L15R and A24R , introduce charged residues in the hydrophobic region . 
On the other hand , single mutations in the N-terminal or C-terminal extremities had minor or no detectable effect on MgtR function . 
In the L15R mutant of MgtR , the peptide was poorly expressed and was similarly found in insoluble and soluble fractions , suggesting incorrect MgtR location ( Figure 6C ; Supplementary Figure S3 ) . 
The A24R mutant of MgtR appeared mostly to be membrane associated despite the introduction of a charged residue . 
We have carried out additional mutations , A15P and A24P , that would disrupt the a-helix but maintain the hydrophobicity . 
Both mutations reduced MgtC degradation ( Figure 6C ) . 
In the course of previous studies , we have characterized several mutant forms of MgtC substituted in residues that are conserved among MgtC proteins ( Rang et al , 2007 ; C Rang and A-B Blanc-Potard , unpublished results ) . 
We have noticed that mutants E84A , G85A and N92T , led to a high level of MgtC protein by western blot analysis in S. typhimurium ( data not shown ) . 
We hypothesized that these mutations , which are clustered in the cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains ( TM3 and TM4 ) of MgtC ( Figure 7A ) , might interfere with MgtR regulation . 
Plasmids encoding mutant MgtC proteins were introduced in isogenic E. coli strains expressing or lacking MgtR . 
In contrast to the wild-type protein , mutant MgtC proteins were similarly expressed in the presence or absence of MgtR ( Figure 7B ) . 
Hence , the E84A , G85A and N92T mutations render MgtC

Bacterial two-hybrid analysis demonstrates that MgtC 
Both MgtC and MgtR are predicted to localize in the innermembrane . 
To test putative interaction between MgtC and MgtR , we have used the Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two-Hybrid ( BACTH ) system that has been validated for detecting speciﬁc interactions between inner-membrane proteins ( Karimova et al , 2005 ) . 
A derivative of pUT18 was constructed to fuse the T18 fragment of adenylate cyclase to the C-terminal end of MgtC , that is cytoplasmic ( Rang et al , 2007 ) . 
A derivative of pKT25DXbaI was constructed to fuse the T25 fragment of adenylate cyclase to the N-terminal end of MgtR , that is predicted to be cytoplasmic . 
Plamids encoding the T18 and T25 fusion proteins were introduced in an E. coli cya mutant ( BTH101 ) and functional complementation was determined by measuring b-galactosidase activity ( Figure 8 ) . 
A high level of b-galactosidase activity was observed when BTH101 was co-transformed with the MgtC-T18 and T25-MgtR encoding plasmids , indicating an interaction between both fusion proteins . 
Only basal level of b-galactosidase activity was observed with the two vectors or with either fusion protein with the other vector control . 
To investigate the correlation between MgtC -- MgtR interaction and MgtC downregulation , we have introduced in the two-hybrid plasmids mutations in MgtR or MgtC that prevent MgtR-assisted MgtC degradation . 
As shown in Figure 8 , the two mutations in the hybrophobic domain of MgtR , L15R and A24R gave only a basal level of b-galactosidase activity , indicating a lack of MgtR -- MgtC interaction , whereas mutations L15P and A24P only lowered the interaction . 
The substitutions E84A , G85A and N92T in MgtC also lowered the interaction , with a marked effect for the MgtC mutant G85A that exhibited a b-galactosidase activity only 2.5-fold higher than basal level . 
These effects are not due to a lower expression of the mutated hybrid proteins ( data not shown ) . 
The effect on the interaction of mutations L15P and A24P in MgtR and E84A and N92T in MgtC appeared much clearer when the b-galactosidase assays were carried out at a more stringent temperature , 371C , since the level of b-galactosidase was below the threshold for interaction ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . 
Taken together , these results show that MgtC and MgtR mutants that prevent the degradation of MgtC can be correlated with a decrease of in vivo interaction between the two partners . 
The fact that MgtC residues located in the cytoplasmic loop between TM3 and TM4 play a role in the interaction with MgtR suggests that TM3 and/or TM4 might interact with MgtR . 
Both MgtR and TM4 contain cysteine residues . 
We have shown that the C22 residue of MgtR had no role in regulation ( Figure 6B ) and a C99A mutation in the TM4 of MgtC had no effect on regulation and interaction ( data not shown ) . 
MgtR and the TM4 domain of MgtC also harbour an Ala-coil domain , which is an helix-helix interaction motif characterized by small residues ( Ala , Gly , Ser ) in heptad repeats ( Walters and DeGrado , 2006 ) . 
To test the contribution of Ala-coil motifs in MgtC -- MgtR interaction , we have substituted small residues of the motif by large hydrophobic residues ( Figure 9A ) . 
Results clearly showed that the disruption of MgtR Ala-coil prevented the interaction ( Figure 9B ) . 
The reduced interaction is not linked to inaccurate expression or location of MgtR since , for example , an MgtR peptide carrying mutation S17I is produced and localized like wild-type MgtR ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . 
Conversely , the change to another small residue ( mutation A24G ) had no effect ( Figure 9B ) , probably because a correct helix packing is preserved . 
A correlation is found between MgtC -- MgtR interaction with the BACTH system and regulation of MgtC expression in western blot analysis ( Figure 9C ) . 
On the other hand , single mutations in the Ala-coil domain of MgtC TM4 had no effect on MgtC -- MgtR interaction with the exception of G108F ( Figure 9B ; Supplementary Figure S4 ) . 
The loose interaction in the presence of G108F mutation might be related to a lower expression of the MgtC-T18 hybrid protein ( data not shown ) .

Role of MgtR in intramacrophage survival
Periplasm 
MgtC plays a role for Salmonella intramacrophage growth ( Blanc-Potard and Groisman , 1997 ) . 
The mutations E84A , G85A and N92T in MgtC produce proteins that can not complement the macrophage growth defect of a S. typhimurium DmgtC mutant ( Rang et al , 2007 ; data not shown ) . 
We have compared the intramacrophage survival of a S. typhimurium wild-type strain and a DmgtR-mutant strain . 
The absence of MgtR had only a slight effect on intracellular growth ( Figure 10A ) , indica-ting that the stabilization of MgtC has no major effect in this virulence assay . 
In addition , the DmgtR-mutant strain grew 2þ similarly as the wild-type strain in low-Mg medium ( data not shown ) . 
On the other hand , we have shown that the overexpression of MgtR in an S. typhimurium wild-type strain signiﬁcantly reduced the intramacrophage growth ( Figure 10B ) . 
This intracellular growth defect is not linked to a slow down of bacterial growth rate , since strains exhibited similar growth curves in Luria Broth ( LB ) medium or low-Mg medium 2þ ( data not shown ) .

Discussion
Multiple regulatory pathways control the MgtC protein 
The mgtCB operon is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level by the PhoPQ two-component system in response to external Mg concentration ( Garcıa-Ve ́scovi et al , 1996 ) . 
2 þ The PhoP regulatory protein interacts directly with the mgtCB promoter ( Zwir et al , 2005 ) . 
In addition , the operon is regulated at the transcriptional level by intracellular Mg 2 þ concentration through a PhoPQ-independent mechanism that depends on the secondary structure of its 50UTR ( Groisman et al , 2006 ) . 
In the present study , we describe an additional level of regulation at the post-translational level for the MgtC protein . 
Expression of the MgtC protein is prevented by the MgtR peptide , which is encoded downstream of the mgtB gene . 
The MgtR peptide directly interacts with MgtC and probably unfolds MgtC to promote its degradation by the membrane-bound AAA þ protease FtsH . 
This novel regulatory mechanism , which identiﬁes for the ﬁrst time a virulence factor as FtsH target , is schematized in Figure 11 . 
levels 
MgtC is an inner-membrane protein that harbours ﬁve transmembrane segments in the ﬁrst half of the protein ( Rang et al , 2007 ) . 
MgtR is an inner-membrane peptide with a single highly hydrophobic transmembrane domain . 
Using the bacterial two-hybrid BACHT system , which appears as the technique of choice to study interaction between bacterial proteins within biological membranes ( Karimova et al , 2005 ; Schneider et al , 2007 ) , we could demonstrate interaction between MgtC and MgtR . 
The strength of this interaction correlates with the ability of MgtR to mediate MgtC degradation . 
The hydrophobicity and the a-helical structure of MgtR are important for its function . 
The interaction between mem-brane-imbedded helices remains hard to predict solely on the basis of amino-acid sequences , but some motifs can drive helix -- helix interactions ( Schneider et al , 2007 ) . 
MgtR harbours an Ala-coil motif that has been implicated in the association of membrane-imbedded helices ( Walters and DeGrado , 2006 ) This Ala-coil motif appears essential for

Extracts were prepared from S. typhimurium DmgtR strain carrying the mutated pQEMgtR plasmids and blotted with anti-MgtC antibodies . 
The pQE30 vector and pQEMgtR plasmid were used as control . 
MgtR , a regulatory peptide that interacts with MgtC 
and promotes its degradation by the FtsH protease 
MgtC -- MgtR interaction and MgtR-mediated MgtC degradation . 
We identiﬁed mutations in MgtR , as S17I or A24L , that do not prevent the expression or membrane location of the peptide , and completely abolish its regulatory function and interaction with MgtC . 
We have also identiﬁed mutations in MgtC that prevented its downregulation by MgtR and lowered the interaction of MgtC with MgtR in the BACHT system . 
These mutations are located in a cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains ( TM3 and TM4 ) of MgtC . 
The context of a transmembrane helix is essential for its correct topology and loops can contribute to the stability of helix interactions ( Schneider et al , 2007 ) . 
Hence , loop mutations could disrupt the helical packing in TM3 and/or TM4 and thereby prevent interaction with MgtR . 
Interestingly , the fourth helical segment of MgtC harbours an Ala-coil motif . 
However , mutagenesis of single residues did not indicate a contribution of this motif in the interaction with MgtR . 
The interacting domain of MgtC might be complex and involve more than a single TM domain . 
A kinetic experiment demonstrated that MgtR promotes MgtC degradation , although through a relatively slow process . 
MgtR acts speciﬁcally on MgtC since no effect was detected on MgtB . 
The fact that both MgtC and MgtR are encoded by the same operon is rather surprising and raises the question of timing for MgtC expression and the regulatory peptide expression . 
Previous studies have indicated that MgtC can be detected after limited time of Mg starvation 2 þ ( 2 -- 4 h ) ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ; Adkins et al , 2006 ; data not shown ) , but MgtC is not expressed anymore after 16 h Mg starvation ( Moncrief and Maguire , 1998 ; Figure 3A ) . 
2 þ Our results suggest that upon induction of the mgtCBR operon , MgtR does not affect MgtC production , MgtC being similarly expressed in the presence or absence of MgtR after short time induction ( data not shown ) , but that the production of MgtR promotes MgtC degradation after few hours . 
We have shown that the degradation of MgtC is dependent on the presence of a functional FtsH protease . 
FtsH is the only membrane-bound AAA þ protease in E. coli and this protease plays an important role in the quality control of membrane proteins ( Ito and Akiyama , 2005 ) . 
We propose that the interaction between MgtC and MgtR might unfold MgtC and make it a substrate for FtsH-mediated degradation . 
FtsH recognizes unstructured peptide sequences , which are typically located at the N - or C-terminal end of a target protein , and degrades target protein processively . 
Internal loops also contribute to the degradation of substrates by FtsH and other AAA þ proteases ( Datta et al , 2005 ; Hoskins and Wickner , 2006 ; Okuno et al , 2006 ) . 
To date , the precise mechanism of degradation of MgtC by FtsH remains unknown . 
To our knowledge , MgtR is the ﬁrst example of an a-helical hydrophobic peptide that modulates degradation of a bacter-ial membrane protein by an AAA þ protease . 
It is possible that the participation of peptides in the regulation of protein stability might be a more common process that has not been characterized yet due to the lack of appropriate screening / detection methods . 
To date , the only other reported case of a peptide that modulates AAA þ protease activity is the SpoVM peptide from Bacillus subtilis , which , in contrast to MgtR , is an amphipathic helix ( Cutting et al , 1997 ; Prajapati et al , 2000 ) . 
SpoVM has been involved in sporulation and has an inhibitory action on the FtsH protease . 
In addition , several adaptor proteins modulate proteolysis by enhancing or inhibiting interaction between speciﬁc substrates and AAA þ proteases ( Dougan et al , 2002 ; Baker and Sauer , 2006 ) . 
Most adaptor proteins interact directly with the substrate in complex with the AAA þ partner protein and they usually modulate recognition of the substrate . 
Adaptors are generally small proteins encoded by genes that are rarely co-tran-scribed with the genes encoding their target ( s ) . 
MgtR differs from previously described adaptors in its size and coexpression with its target .

Figure 11 Model for the role of MgtR in MgtC expression : the MgtR peptide binds directly to MgtC at the cytoplasmic membrane . 
The interaction between MgtC and MgtR would unfold MgtC and make it a target for degradation by the FtsH protease . 
Physiological role of MgtR during infection
MgtR is conserved in other Salmonella enterica serovars ( S. typhi and S. choleraesuis ) , but is not found in other bacterial species that encode MgtC . 
Hence , it seems that Salmonella has developed a speciﬁc regulatory system that acts as a negative feedback to limit the amount of MgtC protein . 
We propose that this feedback regulation is linked to the high transcriptional induction of the Salmonella mgtC gene under certain conditions . 
In other bacteria , the mgtC gene might be expressed at lower levels , preventing the need for a feedback regulatory mechanism . 
MgtC has likely been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and is known to be differentially regulated in various species ( Alix and Blanc-Potard , 2007 ) . 
MgtC is required for intramacrophage growth ( Alix and Blanc-Potard , 2007 ) and the Salmonella mgtCB operon is highly induced in macrophages ( Smith et al , 1998 ; Eriksson et al , 2003 ) . 
However , a proteomic analysis of S. typhimurium isolated from macrophages identiﬁed MgtB but not MgtC ( Shi et al , 2006 ) . 
This suggests that the intracellular level of MgtC protein is low and/or that there is a detectable expression at infection times that were not experimentally tested . 
To better understand the physiological role of MgtR during Salmonella infection , we have investigated the growth phenotype of a DmgtR mutant in macrophages . 
The DmgtR mutant is only slightly attenuated for growth within macrophages , indicating that MgtR does not play a major role in this virulence assay . 
On the other hand , overexpression of MgtR in a wild-type strain of S. typhimurium reduces signiﬁcantly the ability of the strain to grow within macrophages . 
This might be linked to a high degradation level of the MgtC virulence factor . 
Hence , this result suggests that MgtR could act as an antagonist of the MgtC virulence factor under certain conditions . 
Conclusion
The completion of bacterial genomes has signiﬁcantly improved the description of regulatory networks . 
However , small ORFs are not annotated on genome maps . 
In addition , functional small ORFs are rarely detected by genetic screening due to the low frequency of mutational or insertion events in these regions . 
To date , studies on small ORFs have mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of small regulatory RNAs . 
In the present study , we have identiﬁed a regulatory peptide involved in the degradation of a virulence factor . 
In Salmonella , a recent peptidomics analysis , which did not include peptides encoded by non-annotated ORFs , has suggested a targeted protein degradation under phagosome-mimicking culture conditions ( Manes et al , 2007 ) . 
Further peptidomics research is required to characterize additional functional bacterial peptides , which can be encoded by small ORFs or can be generated by the proteolytic cleavage of proteins . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All S. typhimurium strains are derived from wild-type 14028s with the exception of TH6767 and NM643 that are derived from LT2 . 
E. coli thermosensitive ftsH1 mutant ( Begg et al , 1992 ) is derived from W3110 and has been provided by T Ogura . 
E. coli DH5a ( Hanahan , 1983 ) was used as host in cloning experiments . 
Bacteria were grown in LB supplemented with suitable antibiotics to maintain plasmid DNA ( ampicillin ( Amp ) at 100 mg ml 1 , kanamycin ( Kan ) at 25 mg ml 1 , chloramphenicol ( Cm ) at 10 mg ml 1 ) . 
Growth in low-Mg liquid medium was carried out in NCE-minimal 2þ medium ( Maloy , 1990 ) supplemented with 0.1 % casamino acids , 38 mM glycerol and 10 mM MgCl2 . 
Growth in high-Mg2þ liquid medium was carried out in the same medium supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 . 
Plasmids construction
Plasmids puriﬁed with Qiaprep spin kit ( Qiagen ) were introduced into S. typhimurium strains by electroporation using a Bio-Rad apparatus , and into E. coli strains by chemical transformation using standard procedures . 
Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I , and primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . 
Deletions of sequences downstream of mgtC were carried out on the pEG9091 plasmid that harbours the mgtCB operon ( Figure 1A ) . 
PCR ampliﬁcation was performed with primers ﬂanking the region to delete . 
Ampliﬁed fragments were phosphorylated and self-ligated . 
To clone mgtR , a 1200-bp HindIII -- PstI restriction fragment from pEG9091del3 , which carries a 270-bp region downstream of mgtB , R was ﬁrst subcloned into pBBR1MCS , which is a Cm vector compatible with pBR322 derivatives . 
Deletions were subsequently made at the 30 ( with primers sup30-F and sup30-R ) and 50 ( with primers sup50-F and MgtB-del-F ) extremities of the insert to keep a 150-bp region downstream of mgtB that includes the last six codons of mgtB . 
The resulting plasmid was called pMgtR . 
To produce a His-tagged MgtR peptide , we cloned the mgtR gene between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pQE30 vector ( Qiagen ) . 
The cloned fragment resulted from the annealing of long oligonucleotides ( MgtR-BamHind-F and MgtR-HindBam-R ) corres-ponding to the entire mgtR sequence with cloning sites at the ends . 
The resulting plasmid , pQEMgtR , encodes an N-terminal His-tagged MgtR . 
Overexpression of MgtR was not well tolerated by bacteria and pQEMgtR was maintained in strains that harbour the lacI gene q on pREP4 plasmid . 
Expression of His6-MgtR was induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG . 
Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on plasmids using the Quickchanges II kit ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Sets of primers were designed for each engineered mutation including sufﬁciently long ﬂanking regions . 
Sequencing was conducted to conﬁrm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations . 
Western blot analysis
Bacteria were grown overnight in low-Mg medium ( to induce 2þ mgtC transcription ) supplemented with suitable antibiotics to maintain plasmid DNA . 
To prepare whole-cell extracts , cultures were normalized for the number of cells , centrifuged , resuspended in 100 ml Laemmli buffer and lysed by 10 min boiling . 
Samples were run on 12 % SDS -- PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) for immunoblotting . 
Anti-MgtC antibodies were raised in rabbits against the His-tagged C-terminal domain of the MgtC protein ( Rang et al , 2007 ) . 
Hence , these antibodies react both with MgtC protein and His-tagged proteins . 
Mouse anti-DnaK antibodies ( Tebubio ) used at 1:5000 dilution were used as control . 
Rabbit anti-MgtB antibodies , kindly provided by M Maguire , were used at 1:1000 dilution . 
Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antiserum ( Sigma ) were used at 1:3000 dilution . 
The blots were developed with the ImmobilonTM Western kit ( Millipore ) . 
Construction of a DmgtR Salmonella strain
A chromosomal deletion in the mgtR gene was constructed using lRed-mediated site-speciﬁc recombination ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
The kanamycin-resistance gene of plasmid pKD13 ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers D-MgtR-F and D-MgtR-R . 
The resulting PCR product was used to replace 76 bp of mgtR in strain MA6897 ( Uzzau et al , 2001 ) by homologous recombination catalysed by the lRed recombinase encoded by plasmid pKD46 . 
The kanamycin-resistance cassette inserted at the chromosomal mgtR locus was transferred by P22 transduction into a wild-type 14028s strain . 
The temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 encoding FLP recombinase ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) was transformed in the resulting strain to allow loss of the kanamycin resistance cassette , leaving behind a single FRT site . 
The chromosomal deletion was veriﬁed by colony PCR using primers MgtB-del-F and MgtRseqR followed by sequencing . 
RNA extraction and RT–PCR
Overnight culture of wild-type 14028s strain was diluted 1:50 into 3 ml of NCE medium containing 10 mM Mg and grown at 37 2þ 1C until OD600 reached a value of 0.7 . 
Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation , washed three times with NCE medium containing 10 mM Mg2 þ and cultivated 30 min at 371C in 3 ml of the same medium before RNA extraction . 
Total RNA was isolated using the SV Total RNA Isolation System ( Promega ) and treated with RNasefree DNase I following the protocol provided by the manufacturer . 
RT -- PCRs were performed with the AccessQuickTM RT -- PCR System ( Promega ) following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Primers used are RT-GapA-F and RT-GapA-R for gapA , MgtC-RT-F2 and MgtC-RT-R2 for ampliﬁcation 1 , MgtR-RT-F and MgtR-RT-R for ampliﬁcation 2 , MgtB-del-F and MgtR-RT-R for ampliﬁcation 3 , MgtBR-RT-F and MgtR-RT-R for ampliﬁcation 4 . 
Reverse transcription was performed by 45-min incubation at 451C , and PCR was performed as follows : 2-min initial denaturation at 951C , 28 repetitions of 30 s at 951C , 30 s at 501C and 30 s at 721C , and a ﬁnal ampliﬁcation of 5 min at 721C . 
To exclude possible DNA contamination , the same reactions were performed without reverse transcriptase . 
Bacterial two-hybrid analysis
We used the BACTH system ( Karimova et al , 1998 ) . 
The mgtC gene was PCR ampliﬁed using pEG9091 as template and primers MgtC-pUT18-F and MgtC-pUT18-R . 
The PCR fragment was cloned at the SmaI site of the pUT18 vector , to produce a fusion protein MgtC-T18 . 
Expression of MgtC-T18 hybrid protein and mutant derivatives was checked by Western analysis . 
The pKT25 vector ( Karimova et al , 1998 ) was modiﬁed by deleting the XbaI site to produce pKT25DXbaI that allows in frame cloning at the BamHI site . 
The mgtR gene was ampliﬁed by colony PCR from 14028s with

Pfu polymerase ( Promega ) using primers MgtR-pKT25-F and MgtR-pKT25-R . 
The blunt-ended PCR fragment was digested by BamHI and cloned into the pKT25DXbaI vector , previously digested by EcoRI , treated with Klenow and digested by BamHI , to produce a fusion protein T25-MgtR . 
Recombinant plasmids carrying mgtC and mgtR genes were co-transformed into BTH101 bacteria . 
Transformants were plated on LB Amp Kan X-gal medium at 301C for 30 h. To quantify the interaction between hybrid proteins , bacteria were grown overnight either at 301C ( as recommended in the BACHT protocol ) or at 371C ( where interaction is usually weaker comparatively to 301C ) in LB Amp Kan liquid medium supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG . 
Before the b-galactosidase assay , cultures were diluted 1:3 in LB medium . 
b-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously ( Miller , 1972 ) , and activities are expressed in arbitrary Miller units . 
Values are average from at least six independent cultures . 
A level of b-galactosidase activity at least ﬁvefold higher than that measured for vectors indicates an interaction .
