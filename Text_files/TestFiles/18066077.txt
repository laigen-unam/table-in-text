Crystal structure of SopA, a Salmonella effector protein
Bacterial pathogens deliver virulence proteins into host cells to facilitate entry and survival . 
Salmonella SopA functions as an E3 ligase to manipulate the host proinﬂammatory response . 
Here we report the crystal structure of SopA in two conformations . 
Although it has little sequence similarity to eukaryotic HECT-domain E3s , the C-terminal half of SopA has a bilobal architecture that is reminiscent of the N - and C-lobe arrangement of HECT domains . 
The SopA structure also contains a putative substratebinding domain located near the E2-binding site . 
The two structures of SopA differ in the relative orientations of the C lobe , indicating that SopA possesses the conformational ﬂexibility essential for HECT E3 function . 
These results suggest that SopA is a unique HECT E3 ligase evolved from the coevolutionary selective pressure at the bacterium-host interface . 
Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins regulates a broad range of critical cellular processes , including cell-cycle progression , immune responses , postreplication DNA repair and transcription . 
Ubiquitination can have several types of effects on substrate proteins , the most common being degradation by the 26S proteasome1 . 
Ubiquitination is achieved through an enzyme cascade consisting of E1 , E2 and E3 enzymes1 . 
E1 activates the C terminus of ubiquitin by forming a thioester bond with the terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin . 
The activated ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to the active site cysteine of an E2 enzyme in a transthiolation reaction , preserving the thioester linkage . 
E3s interact with both the substrates and E2s , facilitating transfer of ubiquitin to lysine residues of substrate proteins . 
Most E3s belong to either the RING-domain ( really interesting new gene ) or HECT-domain ( homologous to the carboxyl terminus of E6AP ) families of proteins , which are quite distinct in sequence , structure and catalytic properties . 
RING E3s share a characteristic globular structure formed by B70 residues , with a set of cysteine and histidine residues coordinating two zinc ions . 
HECT E3s share a B350-residue C-terminal domain having a strictly conserved catalytic cysteine residue positioned B35 residues upstream of the C terminus2 . 
Whereas RING ligases function as molecular scaffolds to bring E2 and the substrates into close proximity , HECT E3s participate directly in the chemistry of ubiquitination by accepting ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme , again in the form of a ubiquitin-thioester intermediate , and directly catalyzing protein ubiquitination3 . 
Crystal structures determined for three eukaryotic HECT domains4 -- 6 show a common fold of two lobes linked by a ﬂexible hinge . 
The structure of the E6AP HECT domain in complex with an E2 enzyme , UbcH7 , demonstrates that E2 binds to a hydrophobic pocket on the N-terminal lobe ( N lobe ) , at the opposite end from the C-terminal lobe ( C lobe ) 4 . 
Because the catalytic cysteines in E2 and E3 are 41 Å apart , it is evident that conformational changes would be required to bring the two cysteine residues in proximity for the transthiolation reaction . 
Compared with E6AP , the two other known HECT domain structures show different relative orientations of the C lobe and the N lobe5 ,6 . 
The three different HECT structures can be interconverted by rigid-body movements of the C lobe around a four-residue hinge loop . 
Mutations that reduce the ﬂexibility of the hinge loop abolish or reduce E3 ligase activity6 , indicating that movement of the C lobe may be essential for HECT E3 ligases to carry out the ubiquitin transfer reaction . 
However , such structural rearrangements have not been observed for any particular HECT E3 ligase , and the orientation of the E6AP N and C lobes is not altered by E2 binding4 . 
Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) , a bacterial pathogen responsible for over one billion human infections each year , has evolved to coexist with its eukaryotic hosts . 
Using a complex machinery named the type III secretion and translocation systems ( T3SS ) , the bacterium delivers a variety of effector proteins into the host cell to promote bacterial entry and survival7 . 
An important mechanism by which microbial pathogens manipulate host cellular function is mimicry of the activities of host enzymes8 . 
We have recently reported that Salmonella SopA , a T3SS effector protein , functions as an E3 ligase regulating host inﬂammatory responses9 . 
To understand the molecular basis of how bacterial SopA mimics eukaryotic HECT E3s , we determined the crystal structure of SopA in two conformations . 
Although it has many unique characteristics , SopA shares an overall structural similarity to HECT E3s . 
Notably , this bacterial protein has obtained , through apparent convergent evolution , several key elements of the HECT domain , including the sequence of the active site loop , the bilobal architecture , and the conformational ﬂexibility of the C lobe . 
In addition , the crystal structure of SopA contains a putative substrate-binding domain that is located near the E2 binding site , which may suggest how the substrate-binding and HECT domains are spatially organized . 
RESULTS Ubiquitination activity of SopA
When incubated with ubiquitin , E1 , E2 ( UbcH7 ) and ATP , a glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) - SopA56 -- 782 fusion protein forms a thio-ester intermediate9 and catalyzes autoubiquitination in vitro ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The active site of SopA , Cys753 , is 30 residues from the C terminus , and C753S mutation completely abolishes the autoubiquitination activity ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Although Salmonella SopA shares little sequence similarity with eukaryotic HECT E3s , an alignment of residues surrounding the active site indicates that , besides the catalytic cysteine , a leucine six residues before Cys753 and a threonine that immediately precedes Cys753 are conserved between SopA and all eukaryotic HECT E3s ( Fig. 1b ) . 
Whereas mutation of Leu747 to alanine yielded only slightly lower activity , mutation of Thr752 to alanine reduced the autoubiquitination activity substantially ( Fig. 1c ) . 
Consistent with this result , the corresponding T819A mutant of E6AP , a human HECT E3 , also had reduced activity4 . 
This conserved threonine residue is located at the interface of the N and C lobes and was suggested to be important in stabilizing a catalytically competent conformation4 -- 6 . 
However , several other highly conserved and functionally important residues in the active site loop of E6AP , such as His818 , Phe821 and Asp822 , are not found in SopA . 
Crystal structure of SopA
Whereas the full length SopA was prone to proteolysis , a construct containing residues 163 -- 782 was stable during puriﬁcation and was active in ubiquitination ( Fig. 1a ) . 
We obtained two structures of SopA from two different crystal systems . 
Native protein SopA163 -- 782 crystallized in a tetragonal system diffracted to 2.1 Å , and selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - substituted SopA165 -- 782 crystallized in a monoclinic system diffracted to 2.8 Å . 
SopA163 -- 782 consists of three structural domains : an N-terminal b-helix , a central elongated region and a C-terminal globular domain ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1 online ) . 
Except for the marked differences in the relative orientations of the C-terminal globular domain , the domain structures of SopA were very similar in the two crystal forms . 
Previous functional studies of E6AP and other HECT E3s indicate that the region upstream of the HECT domain is required for substrate recognition10 . 
The corresponding region in SopA showed a cylindrical structure termed a parallel b-helix ( Fig. 2b ) . 
The central part of the cylinder was formed by ﬁve coils stacking upon each other . 
The N-terminal end was capped by an a-helix of 22 Å in length ; the C-terminal end was covered by strands and two short helices . 
The coils of the cylinder had four faces , and the central residue of each face was invariably hydrophobic , with side chains pointing into the center of the cylinder to form four ` hydrophobic ladders ' ( Fig. 2b ) . 
Residues on the exterior of the cylinder were randomly oriented and variable in their chemical compositions . 
Besides the hydrophobic side chain -- stacking interactions , the b-helix was further stabilized by extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions between the peptide backbone atoms of neighboring coils . 
The b-helix motif has been found in about 30 proteins , including pectate lyase C from a plant pathogen , the phage P22 tailspike protein , the P69 pertactin toxin from Bordetella pertussis and several polysaccharide-degrading enzymes11 . 
Most of the b-helix -- containing proteins are involved in binding to carbohydrates , and the sugar binding site , a cleft formed by protruding loops , is found on the exterior of the cylinder11 . 
Notably , a cleft is also found on the surface of the b-helix domain of SopA . 
In the difference Fourier map there is strong unidentiﬁed electron density located inside the cleft ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online ) . 
Although it is possible that the ﬁrst 162 residues removed for crystallization also participate in substrate binding , the presence of a b-helix domain upstream of the catalytic HECT domain suggests that SopA may recognize carbo-hydrate-modiﬁed substrate proteins . 
The overall molecular architecture of the C-terminal half of the protein , residues 370 -- 782 , resembled that of eukaryotic HECT domains . 
This region had a bilobal structure , with an elongated domain ( N lobe ) connected to a globular C-terminal lobe ( C lobe ) . 
The N and C lobes were connected by a 33-residue a-helical linker ( Fig. 2a , c ) , whereas the linker in eukaryotic HECT domains is short ( three or four amino acids ) and unstructured . 
The N lobe of SopA , containing about 220 residues , had a rod shape with dimensions of B55 Å 25 Å 30 Å . 
The structure of the C lobe ( residues 612 -- 782 ) was composed entirely of eight a-helices and connecting loops ( a11 to a18 ) . 
The N lobe of SopA was similar in size and shape to those of the eukaryotic HECTs . 
As in the N lobe of E6AP , which can be divided into two subdomains linked through two extended strands4 , there were two different packing arrangements within the central domain of SopA . 
The smaller subdomain consisted of a helical hairpin ( a1 and a2 , ) , and the larger subdomain was made of six a helices ( a4 to a9 ) and three b strands ( b1 to b3 ) . 
The two subdomains were connected by a helix ( a3 ) , which packed diagonally to the helical hairpin ( Fig. 2a , c ) . 
There was no apparent sequence similarity between the N lobes of E6AP and SopA , and the ﬁrst residues of the N lobes of E6AP and SopA were located at opposite ends of the molecule . 
Whereas the smaller subdomain of SopA was formed by N-terminal residues of the N lobe , the corresponding domain of E6AP , comprising the E2 binding site , is inserted into a segment that makes up the larger subdomain ( Fig. 2c ) . 
The C lobe of SopA was larger than a canonical HECT C lobe , consisting of 170 residues instead of 100 . 
Instead of the a/b structure found in eukaryotic HECT domains , the C lobe of SopA consisted entirely of a-helices . 
The helices were folded roughly into a spherical shape , with a central four-helix bundle ( a14 to a17 ) ﬂanked by four peripheral helices ( a11 , a12 , a13 and a18 ) . 
The active site loop ( residues 747 -- 755 ) was located on the surface of the molecule facing the b-helix domain . 
The C-terminal residue ( Ala782 ) was partially buried at the cleft between the central domain and the C-terminal domain . 
Conformational ﬂexibility
The two SopA structures determined in two different crystal systems differed in the orientation of the N and C lobes ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The native SopA163 -- 782 adopted a more open form , with the C lobe loosely packed to the N lobe . 
Except a few interactions with the linker helix , the C lobe had no contacts with the N lobe or the b-helix domain . 
Alignment of the structures showed that , compared to the native protein , the C lobe of the SeMet-substituted SopA165 -- 782 was rotated approximately 251 toward the N lobe , moving the active site Cys753 by 14 Å . 
The lobe rotated by bending the linker helix around residue Gln598 . 
Consequently , the N and C lobes formed new contacts , burying about 300 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface at the interface . 
The active site cysteine remained exposed to solvent in both conformations . 
The C lobe movement was much smaller than that in eukaryotic HECT domain structures , where a 31-A ̊ displacement of the active site cysteine was observed between WWP1 and E6AP HECT domains4 ,6 . 
In contrast to changes at the N and C lobe interface , the interaction between the N lobe and the b-helix domain was essentially unchanged between the native and SeMet forms ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Interactions with E2
Because the molecular surface of SopA was completely different from that of eukaryotic HECT E3s , it was not possible to model the E2 binding site based on the E6AP-UbcH7 structure4 . 
The b-helix domain of SopA was positioned very near the site that binds E2 in E6AP , raising the possibility that the b-helix might preclude interactions with an E2 protein because of steric hindrance or , alternatively , might form part of the E2 binding site . 
To map the SopA E2 interaction site , we tested several truncations for their ability to interact with UbcH7 . 
Two constructs , one consisting of residues 163 -- 782 and one of residues 370 -- 782 , each bound stably to UbcH7 in GST pull-down experiments ( Fig. 4a ) . 
To quantify the interactions of SopA with UbcH7 , we labeled UbcH7 with ﬂuorescein-5-maleimide and measured the change in ﬂuorescence polarization upon titration of SopA ( Fig. 4b ) . 
The dissociation constants ( Kd ) determined for SopA163 -- 782 and SopA370 -- 782 were identical ( 32.4 mM ) , indicating that the b-helix domain neither participates in nor interferes with E2 binding . 
Compared with E6AP , which has a Kd around 6 mM ( refs . 
12,13 ) , the afﬁnity of SopA for UbcH7 is approximately ﬁve-fold weaker . 
A shorter construct containing residues 470 -- 782 did not bind UbcH7 in a GST pull-down experiment ( Fig. 4a ) , suggesting that the distal end of the N lobe ( a1 to a5 ) , which would correspond most closely with the E2 binding site of E6AP , is key for E2 interactions . 
Accordingly , the autoubiquitination activity of SopA470 -- 782 was substantially lower than that of SopA370 -- 782 , and the control construct SopA570 -- 782 showed no activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3 online ) . 
The structure of the E6AP -- Ubc7 complex showed that a highly conserved phenylalanine residue of UbcH7 , Phe63 , is key in mediating interactions with eukaryotic HECT domains4 . 
Alteration of this residue abolishes or severely weakens the ability of E2s to function with HECT E3s12 ,14 , with no defects in the interactions with E1 nor in the formation of a ubiquitin thioester13 ,14 . 
Consistently , the UbcH7 F63A mutant bound to SopA with less afﬁnity ( Kd 4 400 mM , Fig. 4a , b ) . 
Moreover , compared with the wild-type UbcH7 , higher concentrations of the F63A mutant were required for the autoubiquitination activity of SopA ( Fig. 4c ) . 
SopA was able to use both wildtype UbcH7 and the F63A mutant at concentrations greater than 0.2 mM ; however , SopA had a clear preference for wild-type UbcH7 over the F63A mutant at lower concentrations of E2 ( Fig. 4c ) . 
Thus , Phe63 in UbcH7 may be critical in recognition of SopA also . 
DISCUSSION
Previously we showed that Salmonella SopA forms an ubiquitin-9 thioester intermediate , indicating that it carries out ubiquitination by a mechanism similar to that of HECT E3 ligases . 
The crystal structures showed that SopA contained three domains , with the C-terminal two resembling the bilobal architecture of HECT E3s . 
Comparison of different HECT domain structures has led to a model in which the conformational ﬂexibility of the C lobe relative to the N lobe is essential for catalyzing substrate ubiquitination6 , and the two alternative structures of SopA are consistent with this model . 
The sequence similarity between SopA and HECT E3s is limited to the activity loop , and the folding of the N and C lobes is different from that in eukaryotic HECT E3 ligases . 
Therefore , one can not completely rule out the possibility that SopA belongs to a previously unidentiﬁed class of E3 ligases . 
An intriguing feature of SopA is the proximity of the putative substrate-binding domain to the E2-binding site ( Fig. 5 ) . 
This arrangement is in marked contrast to the simplest predicted model for eukaryotic HECT E3 ligases , in which the substrate-binding domain would be at the end of the molecule opposite the E2-binding site15 . 
No structural information is available to indicate how the substrate-binding and HECT domains of eukaryotic HECT E3s are spatially organized , and it will therefore be particularly interesting to see whether the SopA model is applicable to eukaryotic HECT E3s . 
Conﬁrmation of the SopA model awaits identiﬁcation of a bona ﬁde substrate and establishment of the functional role of the b-helix domain . 
Recent studies show that a common strategy used by microbial pathogens is to exploit host cellular pathways through functional 8 mimicry . 
In many cases , the bacterial proteins show little sequence nor structural similarity to the host cell protein , except for a few key features preserved to perform the same function8 . 
Here we show that Salmonella SopA represents another case of such mimicry . 
A BLAST search identiﬁed a SopA homolog in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 : H7 ( GI :13361024 ) , with 26 % amino acid sequence identity . 
In addition to SopA , two other bacterial T3SS effectors , AvrPtoB from Pseudomonas syringae16 and IpaH from Shigella17 , function as ubiquitin ligases . 
Neither AvrPtoB nor IpaH shares sequence similarity with SopA . 
Structural studies have shown that AvrPtoB is a RING E3 ligase16 , and biochemical evidence suggests that IpaH belongs to a new class of E3 ligases17 . 
Studies of how these proteins function will shed light on how pathogens exploit the host ubiquitination pathways and provide a unique angle on the molecular mechanisms underlying ubiquitination . 
METHODS
Cloning , expression and puriﬁcation . 
We cloned DNA encoding S. typhimurium SopA163 -- 782 into a pET15b plasmid with an N-terminal His6 tag and transformed the plasmid into E. coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) . 
Bacteria were grown to log phase in LB medium at 37 1C and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 16 1C for 20 h . 
We puriﬁed protein with a cobalt column ( Clontech , TALON metal afﬁnity resin ) followed by gel ﬁltration ( Amersham Biosciences , Superdex 200 ) and ion exchange 
( Amersham Biosciences , Source 15Q ) chromatography . 
We expressed SeMetsubstituted protein in the methionine auxotroph strain B834 ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed it similarly to the native protein except that we added 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol to puriﬁcation buffers . 
The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by protease before crystallization . 
Crystallization and structural determination . 
Proteins were concentrated to 18 mg ml -- 1 and buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris , pH 8.0 . 
We grew crystals by mixing protein solution with a reservoir solution containing 0.2 M sodium potassium phosphate , 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane , pH 6.5 , 20 % ( w/v ) PEG3350 at 1:1 ratio in sitting drops at 20 1C . 
Crystals were stabilized in the reservoir solution by adding ethylene glycol to 20 % ( v/v ) and ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen . 
Data were collected at 100 K on beam line 23-ID at the Advanced Photon Source ( Structural Biology Center , Argonne National Laboratory ) and processed with HKL2000 ( ref . 
18 ) . 
We obtained experimental phasing using SHARP19 and improved it by density modiﬁcation20 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 online ) . 
The initial model was built using program Coot21 and reﬁned in CNS22 and REFMAC5 in CCP4 ( ref . 
20 ) . 
We determined the native protein structure by molecular replacement using a shorter fragment of the SeMet model ( residues 165 -- 580 ) . 
The structures are reﬁned to good geometry , with no residues in the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plots ( Table 1 ) . 
GST pull-down assay . 
We cloned DNA encoding SopA163 -- 782 , SopA370 -- 782 , SopA470 -- 782 and UbcH7into plasmid pGEX-KG and expressed them as GST-fusion proteins . 
We generated the UbcH7 F63A mutant using the Quick-Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis-II kit ( Stratagene ) . 
GST was removed from UbcH7 and the F63A mutant by thrombin . 
GST-SopA fragments were incubated with tag-free UbcH7 in 1:1 molar ratio for 1 h at 4 1C . 
We then added glutathione beads and incubated for 20 min .
