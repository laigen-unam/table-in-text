Abstract 
Bacterial type III secretion systems have signiﬁcant potential to be harnessed for beneﬁcial purposes including vaccine development , anti-cancer therapies , strategies to counteract harmful bacteria -- host interactions , and evolutionary studies . 
The ability to clone and manipulate type III secretion systems would allow researchers to perform novel experiments that would progress the biotechnological development of the potentially positive uses of these systems . 
Here , we report the cloning of the entire Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) type III secretion system on a single DNA fragment that is contained on a self-transmissible plasmid vector for convenient transfer to alternate hosts . 
We demonstrate that the cloned SPI-1 type III system is functional for secretion and translocation via complementation of an S. typhimurium SPI-1 strain . 
We also present a convenient method to construct mutations and epitope fusions in the cloned type III genes and demonstrate that the engineered substrate protein fusions are recognized by the cloned type III system . 
We transferred the cloned SPI-1 type III system into bacterial strains of different genera and found that there is a SPI-1 gene expression defect in these strains . 
The results describe a novel strategy for cloning and manipulation of bacterial secretion system gene clusters and provide a foundation for future studies to develop the beneﬁcial uses of cloned type III secretion systems .

1. Introduction
Bacterial type III protein secretion systems allow secretion of protein substrates to the extracellular milieu and direct translocation of effector proteins from bacteria to the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells ( Cornelis and Van Gijsegem , 2000 ; Ghosh , 2004 ; Hueck , 1998 ) .

The discovery of type III secretion systems has been a major advance in the study of bacteria -- host cell interactions , and many different kinds of interactions between bacterial effector proteins and host cell components have been demonstrated that result in changes to host cell signaling pathways ( Galan , 2001 ; Juris et al. , 2002 ; Neish , 2004 ) , alteration of host cell cytoskeletal architecture ( Galan and Zhou , 2000 ; Nhieu and Sansonetti , 1999 ; Nougayrede et al. , 2003 ) , and stimulation of immune responses against translocated protein epitopes ( Russmann , 2004 ; Russmann et al. , 1998 ) . 
The different Gram-negative species that have evolved to use type III secretion systems include Salmonella enterica serovars , Yersinia spp. , Shigella spp. , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Cornelis and Van Gijsegem , 2000 ; Hueck , 1998 ) . 
The components of type III secretion systems are generally encoded by physically linked blocks of genes , and typically about 20 -- 35 genes , are required for functional type III secretion and/or translocation ( Hueck , 1998 ) . 
Type III secretion systems have much potential to be harnessed for beneﬁcial purposes where bacterial interactions with host cells can be engineered toward a positive goal such as to deliver protein epitopes for vaccinations , understanding how to combat bacterial pathogens , and for anti-cancer strategies . 
Indeed , many studies have already demonstrated the use of type III secretion systems and their effector protein substrates in these applications ( Galan , 2001 ; Hu et al. , 2004 ; Muller et al. , 2001 ; Pawelek et al. , 2002 ; Russmann , 2004 ) . 
Studies of different type III secretion systems have revealed the mechanisms of how the translocated effector proteins interact with host cell protein targets to facilitate invasion and colonization ( Galan , 2001 ; Goosney et al. , 2000 ; Stebbins and Galan , 2001 ; Viboud and Bliska , 2005 ) . 
These studies have led to the identiﬁcation and characterization of potential drug binding sites at the molecular scale and to potential schemes for using translocated effector proteins as targets for antibiotics ( Hu et al. , 2004 ; Muller et al. , 2001 ) . 
The ﬂexibility of the type III secretion mechanism has been demonstrated by fusing different protein epitopes to type III secretion signals and obtaining type III-dependent secretion and translocation of these engineered protein substrates ( Panthel et al. , 2005 ; Russmann et al. , 1998 ; Schechter et al. , 2004 ; Schesser et al. , 1996 ) . 
The Salmonella and 
Yersinia type III secretion systems have been used as devices to deliver foreign epitopes into host cells that results in presentation of the epitopes to the immune system , vigorous immune response and subsequent protection against challenge by the organism from which the foreign epitope was derived ( Russmann , 2004 ; Russmann et al. , 2003 , 1998 ) . 
When administered to tumor-containing mice , S. typhimurium has been shown to colonize the tumors and suppress their growth , and the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI-2 ) type III secretion system has been shown to be required for this observation ( Pawelek et al. , 2002 ) . 
Though the precise role of SPI-2 in the anti-cancer activity is not known , the potential exists to use this region in other bacterial strains that may display anti-cancer activity , but require the functions of the SPI-2 genes to colonize the tumors . 
In addition , effector proteins translocated by SPI-2 may themselves cause host cell alterations that lead to tumor growth suppression . 
The improved ability to genetically manipulate type III secretion systems in different kinds of bacteria will lead to advances in bacterial genetic engineering and biotechnology that could have profound effects on our strategies to utilize type III secretion systems as beneﬁcial molecular tools . 
Toward this end , the presence of an entire functional type III secretion system on a single plasmid vector that can be easily transferred between different bacterial cells would be advantageous . 
In addition , the ability to create mutations in the cloned type III genes or fuse foreign protein epitopes to the cloned type III substrates would increase the range of applications for which the cloned system could be used . 
Previous studies have demonstrated the cloning of entire type III secretion systems as single DNA fragments , but the ability to transfer these plasmid constructs to a range of different hosts was limited and manipulation of the cloned region to create mutations and protein fusions was not demonstrated ( Ham et al. , 1998 ; Hansen-Wester et al. , 2004 ; McDaniel and Kaper , 1997 ) . 
Moreover , it is beneﬁcial to have clones of different type III systems since these systems have evolved to translocate substrates into different types of eukaryotic cells and display variable levels of activity under different conditions . 
The ability to transfer cloned type III secretion systems to a range of alternate bacterial host species would allow important novel evolutionary studies to be performe in which the expression and function of these systems in the other hosts could be tested . 
This would facilitate studies to answer the basic question of whether a given type III secretion system has evolved to be expressed and functional in only the host of its origin or whether it can display activity in other hosts as well . 
This is particularly signiﬁcant in light of the fact that type III secretion systems are typically found in chromosomal regions that have been acquired by horizontal transfer termed genomic islands ( Schmidt and Hensel , 2004 ) . 
In this study , we report the cloning of the entire Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) type III secretion system on a single DNA fragment onto the self-transmissible , broad-host-range plasmid vector R995 . 
The SPI-1 type III secretion system is utilized by S. enterica species to translocate effector proteins ( which are encoded by genes both within and outside of SPI-1 ) into the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells where these proteins can signal the host cells to internalize the S. enterica bacteria ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
The SPI type III system has also been shown to direct the delivery of foreign epitopes into host cells to obtain immune responses in the studies mentioned above ( Russmann , 2004 ; Russmann et al. , 1998 ) . 
We show that the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system is functional for secretion and translocation of substrate proteins as demonstrated by its ability to complement an S. typhimurium SPI-1 mutant strain . 
We show that the cloned SPI-1 can be easily transferred to the alternative bacterial hosts E. coli and Pseudomonas putida , but that the expression of the SPI-1 proteins tested in these hosts is severely defective . 
We also present a convenient method to create insertion mutations and epitope fusions in the cloned SPI-1 genes and demonstrate the utility of this method . 
The work presented here provides a foundation for future beneﬁcial applications of the cloned SPI-1 region and demonstrates a strategy for the genetic manipulation of not only other type III secretion systems , but other bacterial gene systems that can be cloned on a single large DNA fragment . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions
lows : S. typhimurium LT2 ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; All bacterial strains used in this study are as fol ¬ 
Neidhardt , 1996 ) and LT2 SPI-1 ( this study , contains a chloramphenicol marker at the site of the SPI-1 deletion ) ; E. coli TOP10 Rif ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) , MG1655 ( Blattner et al. , 1997 ) , and MG1655 Nal ( a nalidixic acid resistant derivative of MG1655 isolated for this study ) ; P. putida ATCC12633 and ATCC12633 Rif ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) . 
Bacterial cells were grown in Lennox broth ( LB ) ( Ausubel et al. , 1996 ; Lennox , 1955 ) , LB 0.3 M NaCl ( Chen et al. , 1996 ) , and LB no NaCl ( Eichelberg et al. , 1999 ) . 
Agar was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 % for all solid media . 
Antibiotics were used to maintain plasmids in the different host strains as indicated below in the section describing plasmid transfer . 
2.2. DNA methods
DNA manipulations and PCR were performed using standard protocols as described previously ( Ausubel et al. , 1996 ; Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
All plasmid DNA were isolated using Qiagen columns as described by the manufacturer ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . 
2.3. Protein methods and antisera
Preparation of secreted bacterial proteins , SDS-PAGE , Coomassie staining , and Western blotting were performed using standard protocols as described previously ( Ausubel et al. , 1996 ; Kaniga et al. , 1995 ) . 
Antisera was used at the following dilutions : Rabbit polyclonal - SipC antisera ( generously provided Dr. Ed Oaks , Dr. William Picking , and Dr. Wendy Picking ) : 1:4000 ; Rabbit polyclonal - KleA ( generously provided by Dr. David Figurski ) : 1:2000 ; puriﬁed rabbit - Flag and - HA antisera ( Immunology Consultants Laboratory , Inc. , Newberg , OR ) : 1:2000 . 
A conserved 20 kDa bacterial housekeeping protein reacting to background antibodies found in polyclonal rabbit antisera ( - p20 , 1:4000 ) was used as a convenient indicator of sample loading and purity of secreted protein preparations . 
Please see Section 3 for further information about the use of each antibody . 
2.4. Cloning of S. typhimurium SPI-1 region
typhimurium LT2 genome onto plasmid R995 wa Cloning of SPI-1 and adjacent genes from the S. performed using the VEX-Capture technique for the targeted excision and cloning of large DNA fragments ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) . 
Brieﬂy , loxP sites were inserted on both sides of the targeted 48 kbp genomic region , and this region was excised from the chromosome via Cre-mediated site-speciﬁc recombination as a non-replicating , circular molecule . 
An R995 plasmid derivative containing a DNA fragment from the sitABCD region was used to clone ( or `` capture '' ) the excised circle via host homologous recombination mechanisms . 
The R995 + SPI-1 plasmid was islolated from S. typhimurium via conjugation to a differentially marked E. coli recipient ( strain TOP10 Rif ) . 
A spectinomycin/streptomycin marker is present on the cloned genomic region and serves to maintain R995 + SPI-1 in different hosts . 
The molecular structure of R995 + SPI-1 was conﬁrmed using PCR with several sets of primers designed as previously described for the analysis of other regions cloned with VEX-Capture ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) . 
Cre/lox-mediated excision of the targeted chromosomal section created an S. typhimurium strain containing a deletion of SPI-1 ( S. typhimurium LT2 SPI-1 ) that is replaced with a chloramphenicol marker at the deletion site . 
This strain was used as a host for analysis of R995 + SPI-1 in the present studies . 
Though the components for type III secretion and translocation are encoded on the SPI-1 fragment , several effector protein substrates that are used to facilitate interactions with host cells are encoded elsewhere in the S. typhimurium genome and not included in this cloned fragment . 
The cloning of the region described here and its transfer to the indicated hosts is in accordance with established biosafety guidelines and has been approved by the Tulane University Institutional Biosafety Committee . 
2.5. Transfer of R995 + SPI-1 to other bacterial hosts
ent bacterial hosts via conjugation as described previously ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) . 
Brieﬂy , donor and recipient strains were grown overnight in separate broth cultures . 
The cultures were washed with fresh media , mixed at a ratio of approximately 1 donor to 2 recipients , spotted on pre-warmed LB agar plates , and incubated at 30 ◦ C for 4 -- 16 h . 
The mixtures were harvested and The R995 + SPI-1 plasmid was transferred to differtransferred to the indicated agar plates containing the indicated selections . 
The plasmid was transferred to S. typhimurium LT2 SPI-1 and E. coli MG1655 Nal from E. coli TOP10 Rif ( R995 + SPI-1 ) . 
For transfer to P. putida Rif , the strain MG1655 Nal ( R995 + SPI-1 ) was used as a donor . 
The media and antibiotic concentrations selecting for transfer of R995 + SPI-1 to each recipient were as follows ( concentrations in g/ml ) : S. typhimurium LT2 SPI-1 , LB chloramphenicol 50 , spectinomycin 400 ; E. coli MG1655 Nal , LB nalidixic acid 15 , spectinomycin 100 ; P. putida Rif , LB rifampicin 75 , streptomycin 100 . 
Plasmid DNA was isolated from each recipient and the presence of the SPI-1 region was conﬁrmed via agarose gel visualization of supercoiled plasmid DNA and PCR analysis ( see Fig. 2 ) . 
2.6. Analysis of SPI-1 protein expression
To analyze SPI-1 protein expression , overnight cultures of bacterial strains were inoculated from freshly streaked plates and grown for 12 -- 16 h with shaking in the indicated media with selection . 
The next day , the cultures were diluted 1:50 into fresh media and grown until the OD600 reached approximately 1.0 ( corresponding to late log phase ) . 
For stationary phase cultures , growth of the diluted cultures continued for an additional 16 -- 18 h , or alternatively , the strains were inoculated from fresh plates and grown overnight for 16 -- 18 h. Similar amounts of cells ( as determined by the optical density and plating for CFU counts ) were centrifuged in microfuge tubes , the supernatent immediately removed and the pelleted cells resuspended in 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled . 
Equal amounts of these total cell lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for analysis . 
2.7. Tissue culture cell invasion assays
line HT-29 was assayed as described previously using 1.5 h time periods for both the pre - and postgentamicin incubations with the exception that a centrifugation step of 1000 rpm for 5 min was used to bring bacteria in contact with the HT-29 cells ( Nickerson and Curtiss , 1997 ) . 
The data shown is averaged from three separate experiments each done in triplicate wells . 
The invasion data is shown as th Invasion of the human colonic epithelial cell percentage of adhered cells that survived gentamycin treatment . 
2.8. Construction of pMAK-Flag, pMAK-HA, pMAK-SipA-Flag, pMAK-SipA-HA, and pMAK-invA
The plasmid pMAK705 consists of a temperaturesensitive pSC101 replicon , a chloramphenicol marker , and the polylinker region from pUC19 ( Hamilton et al. , 1989 ) . 
To clone the Flag epitope into pMAK705 , we annealed complementary single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the epitope ( DYKDDDDK ) and a stop codon with BamHI and SacI sites at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of this sequence , respectively . 
A similar set of oligonucleotides was used to clone the HA epitope ( YPYDVPDYA ) . 
We also designed `` A '' overhangs at each 3 ′ end of the annealed double-stranded molecules for convenient cloning of the DNA into the T/A vector pCR4-TOPO ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . 
After cloning into pCR4-TOPO and sequence veriﬁcation , the Flag and HA fragments were subcloned into pMAK705 between the BamHI and SacI sites on this plasmid to create pMAK-Flag and pMAK-HA , respectively . 
Genes can be cloned in-frame at their 3 ′ ends with the epitopes on each plasmid using the BamHI , XbaI , SalI , PstI , SphI , and HindIII sites in the polylinker to create a C-terminal epitope fusion . 
To create Cterminal Flag and HA fusions to the SPI-1 SipA protein , we PCR ampliﬁed the last 632 bp of the sipA gene ( genome coordinates 3024682 -- 3025314 ) with primers designed so that the fragment could be cloned into the BamHI and SphI sites of pMAKFlag and pMAK-HA . 
This fragment was cloned into pCR4-TOPO , veriﬁed by sequence analysis , and subcloned between the BamHI and SphI sites in pMAKFlag and pMAK-HA to create an in-frame fusion of the 3 ′ end of the sipA gene ( at the last amino acid codon ) to the indicated epitopes ( pMAK-SipA-Flag and pMAK-SipA-HA , respectively ) . 
To use pMAK705 to create a mutation in the SPI-1 invA gene , we PCR ampliﬁed an internal 1.1 kbp region of the invA gene ( genome coordinates 3039257 -- 3040364 ) , cloned it into pCR4-TOPO , and subcloned it into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pMAK705 . 
Integration of this plasmid ( pMAK-invA ) into the SPI-1 region as described below results in an invA insertion mutation engineered to cause loss of functional InvA protein production . 
2.9. Integration of pMAK constructs into the cloned SPI-1 region
To integrate the pMAK-SipA-Flag , pMAK-SipA-HA , and pMAK-invA constructs into R995 + SPI-1 , these plasmids were transformed separately into the strain MG1655 Nal ( R995 + SPI-1 ) and maintained with chloramphenicol selection ( 50 g/ml ) at 30 ◦ C . 
These strains were then streaked to LB media without selection , incubated at 44 ◦ C , streaked to LB chloramphenicol media , and again incubated at 44 ◦ C. Colonies that grew on these plates were streaked to LB chloramphenicol , maintained at 44 ◦ C , and used to inoculate broth cultures that were used to harvest plasmid DNA for analysis . 
Agarose gel visualization of supercoiled plasmid DNA revealed loss of episomal pMAK constructs and conﬁrmed the presence of the R995 + SPI-1 plasmid . 
PCR analysis conﬁrmed integration of each pMAK plasmid into R995 + SPI-1 ( Fig. 8 and data not shown ) . 
The resulting plasmids ( R995 + SPI-1 : : SipA-Flag , R995 + SPI-1 : : SipA-HA , and R995 + SPI-1 invA ) were transferred to other hosts as described above except that ampicillin resistance encoded by the strain LT2 SPI-1 was used as a counterselection . 
PCR analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from the different host strains containing these plasmids conﬁrmed that the proper structure was maintained ( data not shown ) . 
Though growth at 44 ◦ C with chloramphenicol selection was routinely used to maintain pMAK plasmid integration , we observed that the pMAK plasmids could remain properly inserted for several ( at least 50 ) generations of growth at 37 ◦ C ( data not shown ) . 
Since pMAK705 can not replicate in P. putida , chloramphenicol selection ( 100 g/ml ) at a growth temperature of 30 ◦ C was sufﬁcient to maintain integration of the pMAK constructs in this species . 
3. Results
3.1. Cloning of the S. typhimurium SPI-1 type III secretion system
S. typhimurium SPI-1 as a cloned fragment , we use To obtain the type III secretion system encoded by the VEX-Capture technique for the targeted excision and cloning of large bacterial chromosomal sections ( Wilson et al. , 2004 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the VEX-Capture technique allows precise Cre/lox-mediated excision of the desired chromosomal fragment as a non-replicating , covalently closed circular molecule and simultaneous cloning ( or `` capture '' ) of the excised circular molecule by homologous recombination . 
The vector used to capture the excised chromosomal region was the self-transmissible , broad-host-range plasmid R995 ( Pansegrau et al. , 1994 ) containing a DNA fragment from the sitABCD region of SPI-1 ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
A map of S. typhimurium SPI-1 and adjacent genes ( 48.3 kbp total ) that are present in the R995 + SPI-1 clone is presented in Fig. 1 . 
We transferred this plasmid to an S. typhimurium strain containing a deletion of SPI-1 , two different E. coli strains , and a P. putida strain . 
The presence of the cloned SPI-1 region in these different hosts was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis as shown in Fig. 2 . 
3.2. Analysis of SipC expression from R995 + SPI-1
To test for SPI-1 gene expression from the R995 + SPI-1 construct , we probed Western blots of different bacterial cell lysates with antisera against the SipC protein . 
SipC is a substrate of the SPI-1 type 
III secretion system that is essential for the translocation of other effector proteins and displays effector protein activity itself in host cells ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
Western blot analysis revealed that SipC is expressed from R995 + SPI-1 in S. typhimurium SPI-1 under both SPI-1 inducing ( LB 0.3 NaCl ) and SPI-1 non-inducing ( LB no NaCl ) conditions , though an induction of SipC to higher levels could be observed by the addition of 0.3 M NaCl ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The observed expression of SipC from the cloned island under the `` non-inducing '' condition is likely due in part to the fact that multiple copies of the R995 + SPI-1 plasmid are present ( about 10 copies per chromosome ) ( Wilson et al. , 1997 ) . 
Similar results were obtained from both late log and stationary phase cultures , however growth of the cultures into stationary phase seemed to allow increased expression and/or accumulation of SipC ( data not shown ) . 
Expression of SipC from R995 + SPI-1 was not detected in either E. coli strain or the P. putida strain , though expression of an R995 vector-encoded protein , KleA , was readily detected in all strains ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The lanes in Fig. 3 contain samples of cell lysates from approximately 0.2 ml of cultures . 
Loading of cell lysate samples equivalent to 1.7 ml of culture for the E. coli and P. putida strains still did not allow SipC expression to be detected from these strains ( data not shown ) . 
Analysis of both late log and stationary phase E. coli and P. putida cultures containing R995 + SPI-1 gave the same result ( data not shown )

3.3 . 
Complementation of S. typhimurium SPI-1 with R995 + SPI-1 : the cloned SPI-1 region is functional for protein secretion and translocation 
To demonstrate that the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system is functional for protein secretion , we made protein preparations from supernatants harvested from S. typhimurium WT , SPI-1 , SPI-1 ( R995 ) , and SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 ) cultures . 
SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of samples from these preparations revealed the characteristic pattern of multiple secreted substates of the SPI-1 type III system for the WT and SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 ) strains and not for the SPI ¬ 
1 and SPI-1 ( R995 ) strains ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Western blots of these preparations probed with - SipC antisera con-ﬁrmed the presence of SipC in the secretion preps from the WT and SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 ) strains ( Fig. 5 ) . 
To demonstrate that the presence of SipC in the culture supernatent of the SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 ) strain was not due to cell lysis or secretion by a mechanism other than the SPI-1 type III system , we constructed an insertion mutation in the invA gene of the cloned SPI-1 region ( R995 + SPI-1 invA ) designed to prevent functional expression of the InvA protein ( see Section 2 for details ) . 
The InvA protein is an essential component of the SPI-1 type III secretion apparatus ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
Western blot analysis of secretion preps obtained from the SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 invA ) strain showed that secretion directed by the cloned SPI-1 type III system is abolished by the invA mutation ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In addition , probing Western blots of the secretion preps with antibodies against a housekeeping protein ( - p20 ) con-ﬁrmed that proteins found in the supernatants were not due to release of cell contents by cell lysis ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Similar analysis of secretion preparations obtained fro the E. coli strain MG1655 Nal ( R995 + SPI-1 ) failed to reveal the presence of SipC in these preparations ( data not shown ) . 
To determine if the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system could function to translocate effector proteins inside host cells , we performed tissue culture cell invasion assays with the strains S. typhimurium WT , SPI-1 ( R995 ) , SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 ) , and SPI-1 ( R995 + SPI-1 invA ) ( Fig. 6 ) . 
The ability of S. typhimurium to enter host epithelial cells is dependent on the translocation of effector proteins to the cytosol of host cells via the activity of the SPI-1 type III system ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
The data show that the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system fully restores host cell invasion of the S. typhimurium SPI-1 strain and demonstrates that the cloned type III system is able to translocate proteins into host cells . 
The results also show that this translocation activity is dependent on a functional type III apparatus since the R995 + SPI-1 invA plasmid did not restore the invasion phenotype ( Fig. 6 ) . 
When the same assay was performed with the non-invasive E. coli strain MG1655 Nal , the presence of R995 + SPI-1 did not allow these bacteria to enter the tissue culture cells

( Panel A ) Samples from the protein secretion preps shown in Fig. 4 were Western blotted and probed with - SipC antisera . 
The S. typhimurium strains corresponding to each sample are indicated above the lanes . 
( Panel B ) Protein secretion preps were obtained from different S. typhimurium SPI-1 strains containing the indicated plasmids ( grown in LB 0.3 M NaCl ) , and the secretion preps and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting and probing with - SipC and - p20 antisera 
Future bacterial pathogenesis and genetic engineering studies would beneﬁt from the ability to genetically manipulate the cloned SPI-1 region ( and other similarly cloned regions ) . 
Since translocation of foreign protein substrates and epitopes into host cells would be desirable for vaccination and host cell interaction experiments , and since the SPI-1 type III secretion system has been shown to translocate many different kinds of engineered protein substrates into host cells , the ability to construct such epitope fusions in the cloned SPI-1 region would be useful . 
In addition , the ability to make mutations in the cloned region would be helpful for a number of different kinds of studies ( as demonstated in this report in Figs. 5 and 6 ) . 
Therefore , we developed a convenient method to construct epitope fusions and insertion mutations in the cloned SPI-1 region and other similarly cloned DNA sections ( Fig. 7 ) . 
This method is based on the use of plasmid pMAK705 , which contains a temperaturesensitive replicon , chloramphenicol resistance gene , and the polylinker region and lac promoter from pUC19 ( Hamilton et al. , 1989 ) . 
The presence of the lac promoter just upstream of the polylinker allows polarity caused by insertion of pMAK705 plasmid derivatives to be minimized or avoided ( see Fig. 7 ) . 
To demonstrate the use of pMAK705 to create epitope fusions , we cloned the DNA fragments encoding the Flag and HA protein epitopes into the polylinker of pMAK705 to create pMAK-Flag and pMAK-HA , respectively ( see Section 2 for details ) . 
These plasmids allow the creation of C-terminal protein fusions when the 3 ′ end of a targeted gene is cloned in-frame with the Flag or HA sequences . 
Integration of such a construct ′ into the 3 end of the targeted gene on R995 + SPI-1 via homologous recombination allows the epitope to be fused to the native gene and expressed from its native promoter on the cloned region ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Selection for the integration of pMAK705 derivatives is accomplished by shifting the growth temperature from 30 to 44 ◦ C as described in Fig. 7 and in Section 2 . 
The expression and/or function of the epitope-tagged protein can then be tested via suitable assays . 
region for construction of SipA-Flag and SipA-HA protein fusions . 
SipA is a secreted substrate of the SPI-1 type III secretion system and demonstates effector function upon translocation into host cells ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
We cloned the 3 ′ end of the sipA gene in-frame with the Flag and HA epitopes to create the plasmids pMAK-SipA-Flag and pMAK-SipA-HA , respectively . 
We integrated these plasmids via homologous recombination into the proper site at the 3 ′ end of the sipA gene on R995 + SPI-1 and tested for expression of the SipA protein fusions in the hosts S. typhimurium SPI-1 , E. coli MG1655 Nal , and P. putida Rif using Western blot analysis ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Both the SipA-Flag and SipA-HA fusions ( R995 + SPI-1 : : SipA-Flag and R995 + SPI-1 : : SipA-HA , respectively ) were expressed in S. typhimurium SPI-1 ( Fig. 8 ) , and this expres We targeted the sipA gene in the cloned SPI-1 sion responded to changes in SPI-1 inducing conditions ( data not shown ) . 
No expression of the SipA protein fusions was detected in P. putida Rif containing each plasmid , but a very low , but detectable , expression of these fusions was observed in the plasmid-containing

Development of a convenient method to construct epitope fusions and insertion mutations in the cloned SPI-1 region 
E. coli MG1655 Nal strains . 
The SipA-Flag and SipAHA signal in these samples was only detected upon over-exposure of the blots and is not easily visible in Fig. 8 ( data not shown ) . 
PCR analysis of plasmid DNA obtained from these strains using primers that amplif a portion of the SipA-epitope fusion DNA sequence conﬁrmed the presence of the integrated pMAK-SipA-Flag and pMAK-SipA-HA constructs ( Fig. 8 ) . 
To show that the SipA-Flag and SipA-HA fusion proteins could be recognized by the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system , we obtained secretion preps from culture supernatants of strains S. typhimurium SPI ¬

Results of PCR analysis of plasmid DNA obtained from the indicated strains conﬁrming the presence of the integrated pMAK-SipA-Flag and pMAK-SipA-HA constructs are shown in the bottom panels .

Western blot analysis of these secretion preps revealed that SipA-Flag and SipA-HA are secreted to the extracellular milieu ( Fig. 9 ) . 
This demonstrates the construction of type III substrate protein fusions that can be recognized by the cloned SPI-1 type III system .

A convenient method to create epitope fusions and insertion mutations in the cloned SPI-1 region and other similarly cloned DNA fragments . 
( Panel A ) Construction of epitope fusions using pMAK705 . 
A DNA fragment encoding a protein epitope can be cloned onto the temperature-sensitive plasmid pMAK705 and then fused in-frame with the 3 ′ end of a gene targeted for integration . 
In this study , we created two separate plasmids containing the epitopes Flag and HA ( pMAK-Flag and pMAK-HA , respectively ) . 
The 3 ′ end of a targeted gene ( sipA ) was subsequently cloned onto these plasmids and was used to facilitate homologous recombination of the plasmid constructs into the desired location of this gene on the cloned region on R995 + SPI-1 . 
Integration of the pMAK705 constructs was selected by shifting the temperature to 44 ◦ C and plating on chloramphenicol as described in Section 2 . 
This results in fusion of the native gene to the epitope and expression of this fusion protein from its native promoter ( indicated as P tg for targeted gene promoter ) . 
Polarity is potentially reduced or avoided by the presence of the lac promoter ( P lac ) at the indicated location . 
( Panel B ) Construction of insertion mutations using pMAK705 . 
An internal fragment of a targeted gene can be cloned into pMAK705 such that integration of this construct by homologous recombination results in loss of functional protein expression . 
Integration is selected as in Panel A , and similarly , potential polarity caused by the insertion is reduced or avoided by the presence of the lac promoter ( P lac ) at the indicated location 
To construct an insertion mutation using pMAK705 , we cloned an internal fragment of the invA gene into the polylinker of pMAK705 and integrated this plasmid construct ( pMAK705-invA ) into the invA gene of R995 + SPI-1 to create the plasmid R995 + SPI-1 invA . 
PCR analysis conﬁrmed insertion of pMAK705-invA into the invA gene in the cloned SPI-1 region ( data not shown ) . 
The phenotypes of plasmid R995 + SPI-1 invA shown in Figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate that this mutation causes loss of SPI-1 type III system function as expected . 
Thus , pMAK705 is a convenient vector for which to create insertion mutations in DNA sections that have been cloned onto R995 . 
4. Discussion
The ability to obtain entire type III secretion systems on single cloned DNA fragments that can be moved between bacterial cells would have profound implications on our ability to genetically engineer bacteria for beneﬁcial purposes . 
In this study , we report the cloning of the entire SPI-1 type III secretion system on a single DNA fragment contained on a self-transmissible , broad-host-range plasmid vector . 
We show that the cloned type III secretion system is functional via complementation of an S. typhimurium SPI-1 strain . 
We also demonstrate that foreign protein epitopes can be fused to type III substrates encoded by the cloned SPI-1 fragment and that these fusion proteins can be recognized by the cloned type III secretion system . 
These results lay the foundation for future studies examining the beneﬁcial use of the cloned SPI-1 type III secretion system and present a scheme for genetically manipulating the cloned region for expression and secretion of foreign epitopes . 
The scheme utilizing integration of pMAK705 could be used for any similarly cloned region provided there is not homology to pMAK705 present in the clone that would interfere with targeting of any integration constructs to the proper location . 
The ability to utilize foreign epitopes in this system has implications in the potential use of cloned type III secretion systems in vaccine development . 
First , epitopes can be speciﬁcally designed and delivered by the type III system to induce a desired immune response and obtain potential protection against the sourc organism of the epitope . 
Second , since the design of polyvalent vaccines is frequently advantageous , the ability to fuse any desired epitope to the cloned type III substrates provides the potential for a range of different epitopes to be expressed from a single bacterial strain carrying the type III system . 
For example , a bacterial background strain that expresses endogenous antigens from its chromosome could carry a cloned type III system that expressed a different set of antigen epitopes . 
This different set of epitopes could be directed toward the background organism itself ( to provide a more potent polyvalent response against this strain ) or toward a heterologous organism . 
In the latter case , protection could be obtained against multiple organisms with a single vaccine . 
However , since the plasmid constructs described here are self-transmissible , the likelihood of their use in approved safe vaccines is unlikely , though their convenient use for research studies in this area has much potential . 
Future studies aimed at permanently knocking-out the R995 transfer system upon establishment of the cloned type III system in a given host would help to solve this problem . 
Alternatively , development of a method to irreversibly integrate a cloned type III system into a given host chromosome would circumvent this issue as well . 
An advantage of the R995 plasmid vector onto which we cloned the SPI-1 region is its ability to selftransfer to a range of Gram-negative bacterial hosts for studying the function of the cloned type III system in other bacterial species . 
We transferred R995 + SPI-1 to alternate host species E. coli and P. putida ; however , we found that there is a SPI-1 protein expression defect for the tested proteins in these hosts . 
We also observed the same defect when we tested for SPI-1 gene expression from the cloned region in an attenuated P. aeruginosa strain and an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that there is a potential barrier to the functional expression of SPI-1 genes in hosts other than S. typhimurium . 
Future experiments are planned to determine if this barrier acts at the transcriptional , translational , or post-translational level and if expression and function of SPI-1 genes can be achieved in alternate bacterial hosts . 
The expression of the SPI-1 genes is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving the SPI-1-encoded hilA and invF genes where the HilA transcriptional regulator induces invF ( as well genes that encode components of the type III secretion apparatus ) , and the InvF protein then turns on the expression of other SPI-1 genes including the sip genes ( Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ) . 
In addition , there are multiple regulators that act upstream of this cascade to both repress and induce the hilA gene in order to strictly control the expression of the HilA protein ( Jones , 2005 ) . 
Examination of the components of this regulatory cascade in the hosts other than S. typhimurium may lead to clues about how to turn on and regulate SPI-1 gene expression in alternate bacterial backgrounds .

The - Flag and - HA antisera were used simultaneously in this analysis .
