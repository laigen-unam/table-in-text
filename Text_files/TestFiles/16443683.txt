distinct roles in Salmonella pathogenesis . 
SPI-1 effectors are © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA microarrays in vivo bacterial gene expression host -- pathogen interaction the three rounds of SCOTS and the cDNA obtained from infected macrophages 2 h after infection ( T2 ) to Salmonella arrays . 
The initial cDNA obtained from infected macrophages very weakly hybridized to the Salmonella microarrays , and only a few genes were detected ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This result demonstrates the inadequate sensitivity of labeled cDNA and illustrates limitations of direct identification of bacterial gene transcripts during interaction with host cells . 
The low number of genes detected in the initial cDNA and the low intensities of spots also confirmed the absence of contaminating bacterial genomic DNA , which was confirmed by PCR ( data not shown ) , and the lack of host cDNA cross-hybridization . 
The number of detected genes increased in successive SCOTS rounds ( Fig. 1 , see numbers at the bottom of each column ) . 
This increasing complexity of transcripts was previously visualized by Southern blot ( 13 ) . 
All cDNAs used for hybridization to microarrays were obtained by three rounds of SCOTS . 
Nearly 4,000 genes were detected by using SCOTS-cDNA in each of the conditions , without regard to whether they are up-regulated or down-regulated relative to other growth conditions ( see Fig. 1 legend for detection threshold ) . 
These results illustrate that the diversity of capture efficiencies were similar for the different conditions tested and that detection was largely independent of the quantity of bacteria recovered from samples ( Fig. 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
Similarly , detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcripts by using microarrays identified 75 % of genes that had measurable signal intensities ( 21 ) . 
The genomic content of Typhi strain ISP1820 was compared to strain CT18 , the template used for the DNA array design . 
Seventy-six CT18 genes were missing or altered in the ISP1820 genome ( Fig. 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) and four regions ( II , V , IX , and XIII ) encoding prophage-like elements were not detected in strain ISP1820 , as was observed in other Typhi strains ( 22 ) . 
In Vivo Global Transcription Profiles . 
cDNA of Typhi present in the supernatants of infected macrophages was obtained by SCOTS and used as an in vitro control . 
Typhi cDNA was also obtained by SCOTS from infected macrophages after phagocytosis ( T0 ) , and intracellularly at 2 h ( T2 ) , 8 h ( T8 ) , and 24 h ( T24 ) after infection . 
The gene expression profiles for intracellular Typhi were compared with the transcriptome of bacteria from the cell supernatants ( Table 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
During the time course of infection , 36 % of the Typhi genome showed significant expression differences within macrophages compared to extracellular 
Typhi obtained from the cell supernatant . 
The number of Typhi genes down-regulated ( 2-fold ) during infection , compared to bacteria from the cell supernatant , was 490 , 474 , 705 , and 478 genes for T0 , T2 , T8 , and T24 , respectively . 
There were 1,129 genes down-regulated by intracellular Typhi from at least one time point when compared to the supernatant ( Table 2 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and 138 genes were repressed at all intracellular time points ( Fig. 6A , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
Typhi gene transcripts corresponding to 300 different ORFs were more abundant ( 2-fold ) at each time point ( 273 , 309 , 301 , and 309 genes at T0 , T2 , T8 , and T24 , respectively ) . 
A total of 628 genes were up-regulated by intracellular Typhi at one or more time points ( Table 3 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
Some genes were more highly expressed only at one time point , others were up-regulated at two or more time points , and 117 Typhi genes were upregulated at all intracellular time points ( Fig. 6B ) . 
These intracellular expressed genes include SPI-2 genes ( see below ) and other genes involved in virulence , such as pagC , pagD , and mgtBC , and genes encoding osmotically induced proteins ( osmC and osmE ) and phage shock protein ( psp ) . 
SPI Expression . 
SPI-1 encodes a TTSS required for invasion of nonphagocytic cells ( 4 ) . 
We found that some SPI-1 genes were up-regulated during bacterial uptake by macrophages at T0 , such as prg , sip , spa , and inv genes , and then down-regulated after internalization and for the rest of the infection ( Fig. 2A ) . 
SPI-2 encodes a second TTSS that is required for Salmonella survival inside macrophages ( 5 , 6 ) . 
In our model , some SPI-2 genes were up-regulated after bacterial uptake by macrophages ( T0 ) , and most SPI-2 genes were up-regulated after 2 h of infection ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Our results are consistent with the biological roles of both TTSS . 
Moreover , it is notable that genes encoding for SPI-1 effectors , such as sopE , sopE2 , sopB ( sigD ) , and sopD , or SPI-2 effectors such as pipB and sifB , demonstrated an expression profile similar to their respective TTSS even if encoded outside the SPIs . 
SPI-3-localized mgtBC genes , which encode a Mg2 transporter required for full virulence of Typhimurium in mice ( 23 ) , were found to be induced in macrophages . 
No significant difference in expression was observed for SPI-4 and SPI-9 components . 
The SPI-5 encoded gene pipD was overexpressed within macrophages at all time points . 
SPI-6 possesses a mixture of genes that were either up-regulated or repressed in vivo . 
A distinct feature of Typhi compared to Typhimurium is SPI-7 , a 134-kb region ( 24 ) that encodes the type-IV pili involved in entry into intestinal cells ( 25 ) and the viaB locus responsible for the synthesis of the Vi-capsule , which is involved in the suppression of early inflammatory responses of intestinal cells ( 26 ) . 
For SPI-7 , 19 genes were up-regulated within macrophages , including sopE , a SPI-1 effector , and 47 genes were down-regulated within macrophages for at least one time point , including genes involved in Type-IV pili synthesis and genes involved in Vi capsule biosynthesis . 
Their role may be more important at the intestinal level than within macrophages . 
Most of the SPI-8 - and SPI-10-encoded genes displayed signals below the background threshold . 
Functional Classes . 
Typhi genes that were differentially expressed within macrophages were grouped by their function or genetic locus according to the Typhi functional classification scheme used by the Sanger Centre ( www.sanger.ac.uk ) and the percentage of genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated within macrophages in each of these groups was calculated ( Fig. 7 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
Genes involved in iron acquisition and transport ( such as fes , fhu , feo , and ent ) were down-regulated intracellularly ( Fig . 
2C ) . 
Genes involved in chemotaxis and motility , like flagella , were up-regulated during bacterial uptake by macrophages ( T0 ) and then were reduced once bacteria were within macrophages ( Fig. 2D ) . 
Moreover , the majority of genes involved in response to antimicrobial peptides , including phoP , pmrF , ugtL , pqaB , pgtE , mig-14 , and somA ( ybjX ) were significantly up-regulated in macrophages ( Fig. 2E ) . 
In addition , the pagP , virK , and pmrD genes were also more expressed within macrophages than within the supernatant . 
From a list of 92 genes induced after treatment of Typhi with peroxide ( 27 ) , only 18 were significantly upregulated in vivo , including phoH and mgtC ( Fig. 2F ) . 
The sodB gene was up-regulated at 2 h and 24 h after infection , however , expression of the genes encoding OxyR , the oxidative stress regulator and katEG and sodA genes , were not up-regulated by Typhi in macrophages . 
Response of Typhi to acid was investigated by looking at a list of genes known to be acid-inducible ( 28 , 29 ) or associated with the acid tolerance response ( ATR ) ( 30 ) . 
No clear differential expression can be seen . 
However , regulators involved in ATR , such as rpoS and phoP , were induced but are also involved in other functions . 
Salmonella has many transcriptional regulators that control virulence gene expression ( 31 ) , but significant changes in expression levels were observed only for a subset of regulatory genes in Typhi . 
phoP and the ssrBA genes , which encode a two-component regulator of SPI-2 gene expression , were strongly up-regulated from T0 to T24 . 
A 2-fold increase was observed for regulatory genes such as rpoS , rpoH , fur , soxS , slyA , and phoB during infection . 
The expression of other regulators , such as rpoE , rpoD , hilA , barA sirA , oxyR , cyaA , and crp was not significantly changed . 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR ( qPCR ) Analysis . 
The results obtained with microarray experiments were confirmed by using qPCR . 
qPCR results were consistent with the microarray results ( Fig. 3 ) . 
As an example , both methods showed an increased expression of the SPI-2 gene sseB and a decreased expression of the SPI-1 gene prgI during infection . 
Normalization against 16s rRNA gave similar results ( data not shown ) . 
Discussion
This report investigated an approach to circumvent many of the technical problems encountered when studying bacterial gene transcription in vivo . 
We have demonstrated that SCOTS-cDNA represents a complex mixture that can be used for microarray analysis and allowed the study at different times after infection , not only those with relatively large numbers of bacteria , as required by other techniques ( 12 ) . 
The transcriptomes of Typhi from macrophage cell culture supernatant ( in vitro ) or after macrophage uptake and survival at different times after infection were obtained and compared . 
Identification of Typhi gene transcription profiles within macrophages may elucidate the role of some Typhi genes , as adaptation and survival within macro-phages was shown to be critical ( 8 ) . 
We determined that 300 Typhi genes were up-regulated at each time point compared to supernatant ; however , only 117 genes were invariably up-regulated at the three intracellular time points . 
These results indicate that genes overexpressed at a defined time point may be required at different stages of internalization or survival within macrophages or may represent a nonsynchronization of the infection process even though all Typhi examined were internalized in the first 30 min . 
As an example , SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS have very different expression profiles , consistent with their respective function . 
The results obtained from microarray experiments were corroborated by qPCR . 
Two different technologies applied on different biological samples were consistent , supporting the validity of SCOTS-microarray analysis as an effective way to study host -- pathogen interaction . 
The molecular mechanism of typhoid fever has predominantly been indirectly derived from the Typhimurium murine typhoid fever model because these serovars share many virulence genes . 
Our data suggest that many virulence factors and global regulators common to both Typhi and Typhimurium are similarly up-regulated inside macrophages . 
The genes coding for the flagellar apparatus , chemotaxis , and iron transport systems were down-regulated by Typhi within macrophages , as described for Typhimurium in ref . 
9 , indicating that iron is available from the vacuole , which could explain why Typhi can afford to harbor many mutations in iron acquisition genes ( 3 ) . 
SPI-1 encodes a TTSS involved mainly in cell invasion and is an essential system for infection of epithelial cells of the gut ( 4 ) . 
SPI-1 genes were down-regulated after bacterial internalization in mac-rophages as expected ( Fig. 2A ) , and the expression profile of prgI , a SPI-1 encoded gene , was confirmed by qPCR ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The up-regulation of SPI-1 at the earliest times after invasion was not previously observed by Eriksson et al. ( 9 ) , because the earliest time point investigated in that study was 4 h after infection . 
It is interesting to note that SPI-1 and genes involved in motility have similar expression patterns ( Fig. 2 A and D ) , and transcription of flagella and SPI-1 genes are coregulated by fliZ ( 32 ) , which is consistent with our results . 
SPI-1 genes up-regulated during uptake of Typhi by macrophages ( T0 ) may contribute to Typhi invasion of macrophages , as shown for Typhimurium in ref . 
33 . 
SPI-1 effector SopE , which is present in some Typhimurium strains , recruits Rab5 to the Salmonella-containing phagosome , promoting continuous fusion with early endosomes and prevents fusion with lysosomes ( 34 ) . 
In addition , macrophage apoptosis is thought to be mediated , in part , by SPI-1 effectors such as SipB ( 35 ) . 
Thus , induction of SPI-1 during or immediately after invasion is not surprising . 
Another possible role of SPI-1 during macrophage infection was recently demonstrated by the loss of transposon mutants within SPI-1 , such as inv , sip , and prg , after passage into macrophages ( 36 ) . 
We may also hypothesize that some other genes that are not currently known to be effectors may be translocated by the TTSS system of SPI-1 and may contribute to the initial interaction of Typhi with macrophages . 
Two genes encoding for unknown protein , STY1482 and STY1353 , that were up-regulated by Typhi within macrophages were recently identified as new TTSS effectors in Typhimurium ( 37 ) and named steA and steC , respectively . 
The detection of these genes confirms that our method can identify new virulence genes . 
Many cDNAs corresponding to genes with unknown functions or unique to Typhi were up-regulated inside human macrophages , including STY1361-STY1367 , STY2000-STY2002 , and some SPI-6 genes , and will be important to consider for future studies to elucidate the intracellular lifestyle of this human-specific pathogen . 
Genes encoding the SPI-2 TTSS and the Mg2 transport system ( mgtBC located on SPI-3 ) were more highly expressed in vivo compared to supernatant , as was observed with Typhimurium inside murine macrophages in ref . 
9 . 
SPI-2 is well known to facilitate Salmonella survival inside macrophages ( 5 , 6 ) . 
Many genes encoded on SPI-2 were already up-regulated after bacterial uptake ( T0 ) , and other SPI-2 encoded genes were up-regulated only after 2 h of infection . 
Most of the SPI-2-encoding genes were overexpressed at all time points , consistent with their implication in creating and maintaining the Salmonella-containing vacuole . 
Some SPI-2 genes were not differentially expressed , such as the ttr genes , which encode a tetrathionate reduction system ( 38 ) . 
In addition , transposon mutants of ttr genes of Typhimurium are not lost during infection of macrophages ( 36 ) . 
Most of the genes responsible for the SOS response were not differentially expressed by Typhi inside human macrophages compared to the supernatant . 
The SOS genes ( recA , umuCD , uvrABY , sulA , and mutH ) were induced by Typhimurium inside murine macrophages ( 9 ) . 
However , strong inductions of dinI , the repressor of the SOS response , and no induction of other DNA repair systems were observed . 
It is unclear whether Typhi encounters oxidative stress inside human macrophages as systems involved to protect against oxidative stress , such as oxyR and katG , were not differentially expressed ( Fig. 2F ) . 
No clear induction of genes involved in acid response was observed in Typhi . 
It is possible that Typhi already experiences some acid or oxidative stress and that the SOS response was already activated by Typhi cells in contact with macrophages or their metabolic products , present in the supernatant , our in vitro control . 
An important host defense mechanism involves production of antimicrobial peptides . 
Responses to antimicrobial peptides involved the phoPQ two-component system regulator , the pmr operon ( 39 ) , ugtL ( 40 ) , pagP ( 41 ) , pqaB ( 42 ) , pgtE ( 43 ) , virK and its homologue somA ( ybjX ) ( 44 ) , and mig-14 ( 45 , 46 ) . 
These genes were up-regulated by Typhi in human macrophages ( Fig. 2E ) . 
These data imply that Typhi strongly responds to antimicrobial peptides inside the vacuole of human macrophages by modifying its lipid A , as described for Typhimurium in ref . 
47 . 
However , among all of these genes , only pgtE up-regulation was identified by microarray analysis of gene expression of Typhi-murium from murine macrophages ( 9 ) . 
By contrast , most of the drug resistance systems , such as marRAB , emrRAB , aac , and aadA , were repressed or not differentially expressed by Typhi , whereas these systems were up-regulated by Typhimurium ( 9 ) . 
Other differences in gene expression between Typhi and Typhimurium were also identified from the microarray data ( Table 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
It is important to mention that the model from Erickson et al. ( 9 ) contains many technical differences from our model , including opsonization of bacterial cells , a higher multiplicity of infection and number of host cells , a murine macro-phage cell line ( J774-A .1 ) , a different in vitro control ( cell culture medium ) , a different way to obtain cDNA ( differential lysis ) , and the time course only overlapped at 8 h after infection . 
Thus differences observed may be caused by one or more of these factors instead of the different serovar used . 
There are two major regulators of Salmonella virulence genes required for survival in macrophages : slyA and phoP ( 8 , 48 -- 51 ) . 
We detected significant induction of phoP and slyA in Typhi inside the macrophage , which was not seen in Typhimurium ( 9 ) . 
A recent study identified 22 genes that were coregulated by SlyA and PhoP in Typhimurium ( 52 ) . 
Among these genes , 62 % of them were significantly up-regulated by Typhi within macro-phages , including well known virulence determinants such as the SPI-2 genes , sseAB and their regulator ssrA , and many genes involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides . 
In contrast , Typhimurium expressed only 25 % of these genes . 
It was also proposed that once inside macrophages , Typhi-murium uses gluconate and related carbohydrates as carbon sources ( 9 ) . 
However , Typhi lacks the dgo operon involved in the utilization of this sugar , and genes gntT and gntU , encoding transport proteins , were not up-regulated in vivo . 
Repression of gntU was confirmed by using qPCR ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Other sugar transport systems ( hexose and fructose ) were also repressed . 
Therefore , Typhi likely uses different carbon sources inside macrophages than Typhimurium . 
Recent studies showed that isocitrate lyase , which allow the utilization of fatty acid as a carbon source via the glyoxylate bypass , is needed for persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human macrophages and Typhimurium in the mouse model ( 53 , 54 ) . 
The isocitrate lyase gene , aceA or icl , was found by SCOTS to be expressed at 48 h after infection of macrophages by two species of Mycobacterium in refs . 
13 and 14 . 
In Typhi , the aceA gene was significantly induced starting at 8 h after infection . 
In Typhimurium , aceA induction was not detected 12 h after infection ( 9 ) . 
Our study demonstrates that by using SCOTS and microarray analysis , the transcriptome of intracellular bacteria can be obtained without altering the existing infection model . 
The method is an effective way to determine global bacterial gene expression profiling in the context of host infection . 
Its application on tissue biopsies from infected patients , as demonstrated with H. pylori in human biopsy samples ( 19 ) , will be a potential means of further elucidating the bacterial genes expressed during infection of the human host . 
The SCOTS-cDNA mixture displayed an expected expression profile of Typhi virulence genes from infected macrophages . 
Our data suggest that inside THP-1 human macrophages Typhi responds to antimicrobial peptides but does not encounter an acidic or oxidative environment and that Typhi may use fatty acids as a carbon source as soon as 8 h after infection . 
Our global expression analysis identified many hypothetical and characterized Typhi genes that may contribute to adaptation and survival within macrophages , and such data are of importance for future experimental studies to elucidate the intracellular lifestyle of this human-specific pathogen . 
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Bacterial Infection Model . 
The human monocyte cell line THP-1 ( ATCC TIB-202 ) was maintained and infected as described in ref . 
55 . 
For RNA extraction , cells were seeded at 2 107 in 100-mm-wide tissue culture dishes . 
The wild-type virulent Typhi strain ISP1820 ( obtained from D. M. Hone , Aeras Global Tuberculosis Vaccine Institute , Rockville , MD ) was used because it is a well characterized strain that is sensitive to most antibiotics that are used for bacterial genetics , whereas CT18 is multidrug-resistant . 
The strain was grown at 37 °C overnight as a static culture in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth to an OD600 of 0.6 ( 3 108 colony-forming units ml ) . 
Typhi cells were added to the THP-1 cell monolayer at a multiplicity of infection of 10 per cell , a low density that does not affect cell viability ( data not shown ) . 
After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C , the supernatant was centrifuged and the pellet was lysed with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) and frozen at 70 °C . 
The infected cells were washed three times and incubated with complete RPMI medium 1640 ( Invitrogen ) initially containing 100 g ml gentamicin , which was reduced to 12 g ml after 2 h , to kill extracellular bacteria . 
At each time point , 0 , 2 , 8 , and 24 h after infection , macrophage monolayers were washed , lysed in TRIzol , and stored at 70 °C . 
SCOTS . 
RNA from each condition was extracted according to the TRIzol reagent manufacturer 's instructions ( Invitrogen ) . 
RNA samples were then treated with RNase-free DNase ( Ambion ) . 
Each RNA sample was converted to cDNA as described in refs . 
13 and 55 ( Fig. 8 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . 
Briefly , 5 g of total RNA was converted to first-strand cDNA by random priming by using a conserved

Primers are described in Table 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . 
For each qPCR run , the calculated threshold cycle ( Ct ) was normalized to the Ct of the internal control rpoD gene amplified from the corresponding sample , and the fold change was calculated as described in ref . 
60 . 
The alternative sigma factor rpoD was chosen as an internal control because no significant variation of expression for this gene in either Typhi ( this study ) or Typhi-murium ( 9 ) was observed inside macrophages . 
In addition , expression of rpoD in E. coli was shown to be independent of growth phase ( 61 ) .
