Abstract 
We examined mRNA expression of 11 genes : BAK , Bcl-x , Interferon [ IFN ] - g , Interleukin [ IL ] -1 b , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12a , IL-12b , IL-18 , CXCLi2 [ IL-8 / CAF ] , and a MIP family chemokine , CCLi2 , in the spleen and cecum of day-old chicks after oral inoculation with Salmonella enteritidis ( SE ) or medium . 
Three distinct chicken breeds ( broiler , Fayoumi , and Leghorn ) were evaluated for mRNA expression levels at 2 and 18 h post-inoculation using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . 
SE exposure signiﬁcantly increased splenic IL-18 and IFN-g expression . 
Breed effect was signiﬁcant ðPo0 :05 Þ for CXCLi2 , IL-10 , IL-12a , and CCLi2 mRNA expression in the spleen , and for IL-12a , IL-12b , IL-18 , and CCLi2 mRNA expression in the cecum . 
Generally , mRNA expression levels were higher in the spleen , and lower in the cecum , of Leghorns versus broilers . 
These results support a role for breed genetics inﬂuencing cytokine mRNA expression in young chickens and may potentially explain some generalized immune response differences between breeds .

1. Introduction
Genetic resistance to disease in the chicken has been identiﬁed for various types of pathogens , most notably in the association of MHC with Marek 's 
Abbreviations : IFN , Interferon ; IL , Interleukin ; MIP-1b , Macrophage inﬂammatory protein 1 beta ; RT-PCR , Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ; SE , Salmonella enteritidis ; Th , T helper ; TNF , Tumor necrosis factor disease resistance [ 1 ] . 
Additional genetic disease resistance for viral pathogens in poultry has been established for Newcastle disease , infectious bursal disease , and avian leukosis [ 2,3 ] . 
Varied resistance to intestinal parasites such as Ascaridia galli and Eimeria tenella has been shown in different commercial and outbred chicken lines , demonstrating a role of genetics in disease resistance for this class of pathogens [ 4,5 ] . 
Studies of response to bacteria , such as Salmonella , in the chicken show that a strong genetic component is involved [ 6 -- 9 ] . 
Differences in host resistance to Salmonella are observed among commercial broiler lines [ 8,9 ] , inbred or experimental lines [ 6,7 ] , and with indivi-dual bacterial species [ 6,8 ] . 
Cytokines are an integral part of the host immune response to Salmonella in mammalian species and in cell culture models of infection . 
Speciﬁcally , increased mRNA expression and protein secretion of chemokines , proinﬂammatory and Th1 cytokines such as IFN-g , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , and MIP-1b are observed following infection with various Salmonella species [ 10 ] . 
Production of IL-12 and IFN-g are critical to host defense against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria and salmonella [ 11 ] . 
By promoting IFN-g production , IL-18 supports host resistance and clearance of bacterial infections [ 12 -- 14 ] . 
Avian cytokines , like their mammalian counterparts , are inﬂuential in the host immune response to infection . 
Lymphokines produced from immunized spleen cells of adult hens or from a T cell line have protective properties , reducing bacterial counts when injected into young birds challenged with Salmonella enteritidis ( SE ) [ 15,16 ] . 
Young chicks deﬁned as SE susceptible to cecal carrier state had signiﬁcantly lower expression of IFN-g compared to resistant and healthy control animals , indicating a positive role for this cytokine in the reduction of pathogen burden [ 17 ] . 
Recombinant chicken IFN-g , when co-administered with inactivated SE , reduced intestinal colonization , thus providing additional evidence for a protective role of IFN-g in Salmonella infections [ 18 ] . 
Salmonella-induced gene expression proﬁles suggest the importance of additional cytokines and chemokines in the avian host defense response [ 17,19 -- 21 ] . 
While Withange et al. [ 21 ] did not observe changes in gastrointestinal expression of IL-1b , IL-6 , IL-8 , and K60 following S. typhimur-ium in week-old chicks at 1 , 3 , or 7 days post-infection , Kaiser et al. [ 20 ] determined IL-6 mRNA is upregulated in chicken kidney cells infected with various Salmonella sp . 
In the same experiments [ 20 ] , IL-1b mRNA expression was upregulated by S. typhimurium and infection with SE resulted in decreased IL-2 mRNA expression thus showing the importance of both Salmonella sp . 
and tissue or cell choice in evaluating gene expression . 
An additional study showed the spatial/temporal dynamics of chemokine and pro-inﬂammatory cytokine expression [ 19 ] . 
In general , increased mRNA gene expression for the jejuna , ilea , and cecal tonsil was ﬁrst observed between 6 and 12 h post-infection , while similar changes were not observed until later time points in the liver ( 12 to 24 h ) and spleen ( 48 h ) [ 19 ] . 
Functional studies of chicken cytokines suggest similar properties as in their mammalian counterparts . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulates chicken macrophages to secrete IL-1b , which induced CXC mRNA transcripts in a chicken embryonic ﬁbro-blast cell line [ 22 ] . 
Chicken IL-12 requires both subunits ( p35 and p40 ) for biological activity and the recombinant protein stimulates proliferation and IFN-g production in isolated chicken splenocytes [ 23 ] . 
Interleukin-18 strongly induces IFN-g production in chicken splenocytes and serves as a growth factor for CD4 T cells [ 24 ] . 
Recombinant + chicken IL-10 inhibited IFN-g synthesis in activated lymphocytes [ 25 ] . 
Chicken MIP-1b has demonstrated chemotactic properties having induced heterophil and lymphocyte migration [ 26 ] ; however , current literature would suggest that a direct comparison of this gene to the mammalian MIP-1b chemokine is incorrect [ 27 ] . 
Proposed is a new nomenclature for chicken inﬂammatory chemokines numbered according to genomic organization , where CXCLi2 corresponds to CAF/IL -8 and CCLi2 denotes the MIP-like family member previously known as chicken MIP-1b [ 27 ] . 
SE is the main serovar responsible for nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in poultry food products in the US [ 28 ] . 
An average of 35 % of US chicken ﬂocks sampled were reported as SE positive [ 29 ] , and 90.1 % of SE isolates from food , human , or poultry sources were resistant to one or more antimicrobial drugs [ 30 ] . 
Understanding the genetics of host-immune response to SE would provide non-drug-based options to reduce pathogen contamination of poultry products . 
Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 ( NRAMP1 ) , MD-2 , and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 ( IAP-1 ) with spleen bacterial load [ 31 -- 34 ] , and TRAIL , TGF-b3 , and CD28 with cecum bacterial burden [ 33 ] . 
Having shown association of sequence variation in genes involved in various immunological and apoptosis-related networks with SE bacterial load , it was of interest to investigate early gene expression levels in young chicks orally challenged with SE . 
An important aspect of the current study was to examine the role of genetic breed on mRNA expression in proinﬂammatory , Th1/Th2 induction , and apoptosis-related genes early in the post-hatch period of chicks . 
With the signiﬁcance of hos genetics in avian disease resistance [ 1 ] , and general immunological differences between layer and broiler breeds [ 35,36 ] ﬁrmly established , we examined mRNA expression in three genetically diverse chicken breeds . 
The outbred broiler birds , which originated from a commercial broiler breeder line [ 37 ] , are reﬂective of commercial genetic selection for rapid growth and high muscle percentage . 
The highly inbred Leghorn ( G-B2 ) layer line has been used in disease resistance and MHC-restricted immune response studies [ 38,39 ] . 
The highly inbred Egyptian Fayoumi line , which was imported to the US because of reported resistance to leukosis , is genetically distant from the broiler and Leghorn lines [ 39,40 ] . 
It represents a native breed that was not subjected to the genetic selection history of commercial broiler and layer chickens . 
Thus , the three breeds utilized in the current study are distinct , both genetically and immunologically , and serve as a strong contrast of the variation that exists within the species .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Salmonella enteritidis
Nalidixic acid resistant virulent SE phage type 13a ( gift of H.M. Opitz , University of Maine , Orono , ME ) was propagated as described previously [ 41 ] . 
Brieﬂy , bacteria were cultured in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth at 37 1C with agitation until reaching an exponential growth phase . 
SE concentration of the innoculum was estimated using optical density at 600 nm . 
At 1-day of age , chicks were intraesophageally inoculated with 1 10 cfu in 0.25 ml 4 LB broth . 
Chicks not exposed to SE were mock inoculated in a similar manner with 0.25 ml LB broth . 
2.2. Experimental animals
A total of 72 chicks , 24 each of broiler , Fayoumi , and Leghorn breeds , were used . 
Within each breed , half of the chicks received SE inoculation and half were mock inoculated . 
The broiler birds originated from a commercial broiler breeder line [ 37 ] . 
The Fayoumi and Leghorn animals are highly ( 499 % ) inbred [ 40 ] . 
Hatched chicks were wing-banded and placed in pens in biosafety level-2 animal rooms , and they were not fed prior to inoculation . 
Throughout the duration of the experiment the chicks were housed on wood chip bedding and given access to water ad libitum .

Statistical analysis 
2.3. Organ harvest
At 2 or 18 h post-inoculation , half of the chicks of each breed were euthanized . 
Spleens were aseptically removed and immediately placed in 1.5 ml label snap cap tubes and placed into liquid nitrogen . 
Prior to quick freezing of the cecum in liquid nitrogen , cecal contents were gently removed by squeezing the excised organ with an application of light pressure . 
Tissue samples were stored at 70 1C until processed for RNA isolation . 
2.4. Total RNA (tRNA) isolation
tRNA was isolated from homogenized spleen and cecum tissues using RNAqueous ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) according to manufacturer 's instructions . 
RNA concentration and purity were determined using the spectro-photometic absorbance at 260 and 280 nm . 
Undiluted tRNA samples were stored at 70 1C . 
Individual sample dilutions ( 50 ng/ml ) were prepared for use in quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) gene expression assays and stored at 20 1C . 
2.5. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
The mRNA expression levels of BAK , Bcl-x , IL-1b , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12a , IL-12b , IL-18 , IFN-g , CCLi2 , and CXCLi2 were determined by quantitative real-time RTPCR , using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR ( Qiagen , Waltham , MA ) . 
Each RT-PCR reaction , run in triplicate , consisted of either 50 ng or 75 ng total RNA , 12.5 ml QuantiTect SYBR Green master mix , 0.25 ml QuantiTect RT mix , forward and reverse primers , and RNAse-free water for a ﬁnal volume of 25 ml . 
Primer sequences have been previously reported for all genes except BAK , IL-12a , and IL-12b [ 19,23,42,43 ] . 
Primer sequences for these genes are : BAK ( F ) 50 GGGCTGGGCAGCACCGGGAG 30 ( R ) 50 CGAACAAGCTGGAGGCGAT 30 , IL-12a ( F ) 50 TGGCCGCTGCAAACG 30 ( R ) 50 ACCTCTTCAAGG-GTGCACTCA 30 , and IL-12b ( F ) 50 TGTCTCACCTGCTATTTGCCTTAC 30 ( R ) 50 CATACACATTCTCTCTAAGTTTCCACTGT 30 . 
The q-RT-PCR reactions were performed on an Opticon 2 ( MJ Research Inc. , Waltham , MA ) with the following program : one cycle at 50 1C for 30 min , 95 1C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 1C for 15 s , 59 1C for 30 s , and 72 1C for 30 s followed by reading of the plate . 
Gene slopes were determined with a series of ten-fold plasmid dilutions . 
A melting curve from 60 to 90 1C with a reading at every 1 1C was also performed for each individual RT-PCR plate . 
Cycle threshold ( Ct ) values were calculated as follows : 
Individual animal mRNA data are represented as the mean of triplicate measurements . 
Expression levels o mRNA for each gene were analyzed by using JMP software with an ANOVA model [ 44 ] . 
Breed , SE challenge status , and post inoculation sample time ( 2 or 18 h ) were considered ﬁxed main effects . 
All interactions for the ﬁxed main effects were tested . 
All were non-signiﬁcant ( P-value X0 .1 ) and excluded from the ﬁnal model with the exception of the single instance of signiﬁcant interaction , Breed SE exposure on IL-6 mRNA expression in the spleen . 
Student 's t test was used to determine individual rankings of classes within the signiﬁcant main effect ( Breed ) and the interaction of Breed SE on splenic IL-6 mRNA expression . 
Because sample collection time and SE exposure status , as well as all two-way interactions , were generally not signiﬁcant factors on mRNA expression level , data of all tests for each individual gene within each breed were pooled for analysis of breed effect , so that there were 24 individuals per breed , each tested in triplicate , for each gene 's mRNA measurement . 
3. Results
3.1. Gene expression in the spleen
Breed was the only consistent main effect that was signiﬁcant on mRNA expression in the spleen ( Table 1 ) . 
Breed effect occurred for CXCLi2 ( CAF / IL-8 ) , IL-10 , IL-12a , and the MIP like family chemokine CCLi2 . 
There were very few ( 3/22 ) highly signiﬁcant effects due to either SE exposure or sample time . 
Two of these were the effect of SE exposure on IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA expression . 
Challenge with SE increased IL-18 mRNA expression ðP 1/4 0:007 Þ with LS means Ct values of 17.870.2 for SE exposed versus 17.070.2 for unexposed birds . 
Challenge with SE also increased IFN-g mRNA expression ðP 1/4 0:032 Þ with LS means Ct values of 13.670.2 for SE exposed versus 
12.970.2 for unexposed birds . 
Higher IL-18 mRNA expression was observed for the 18 h sample time compared to 2 h with LS means Ct values of 17.970.2 and 16.970.2 , respectively . 
A signiﬁcant interaction ðP 1/4 0:006 Þ of breed SE exposure was observed for IL-6 ( Table 1 ) , which comes from the differential IL-6 mRNA expression in only the Leghorn breed after SE exposure . 
The Leghorn breed upregulated IL-6 mRNA levels with SE challenge , with LS means Ct values for SE exposed birds of 22.270.4 and those unexposed to SE with a Ct value of 20.770.3 . 
For the cytokine genes for which breed had a signiﬁcant effect on mRNA expression levels , a consistent pattern can be observed . 
The Leghorn birds show the highest mRNA gene expression for CXCLi2 , IL-10 , and IL-12a ( Fig. 1 ) , while the broiler breed had the lowest expression , which differed signiﬁcantly from Leghorns . 
The trend of higher mRNA expression of the Leghorns compared to broilers extends to the chemokine CCLi2 as well ; however the Fayoumi breed had the lowest level of CCLi2 expression . 
Breed effect was not signiﬁcant on the expression of the apoptosisrelated genes BAK and Bcl-x , Th1/Th2 genes IL-12b and IL-18 , or the proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6 in the spleen . 
3.2. Gene expression in the cecum
Breed was the only consistent main effect that was signiﬁcant on mRNA expression in the cecum for IL-12a , IL-12b , IL-18 , and CCLi2 genes ( Table 1 ) , with the exception of sample time on IL-6 mRNA gene expression in the cecum . 
The IL-6 mRNA transcript was higher at 18 h than the 2 h sample period . 
The LS means Ct values of IL-6 cecal mRNA expression at 18 h versus 2 h were 21.070.3 and 20.070.3 , respectively . 
In contrast to the pattern of higher mRNA expression in the spleen for the Leghorn breed , we observed the opposite trend for cecal tissue . 
CCLi2 , IL-12a , and IL-12b cytokine mRNA expression were consistently and signiﬁcantly higher in the broiler chicks compared to the Leghorns ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Additionally , the broilers were signiﬁcantly higher than the Fayoumis in IL-12b mRNA expression . 
Although the broilers had the highest level of cecal mRNA expression in IL-12a , IL-12b , and CCLi2 genes , this breed had a signiﬁcantly lower level of IL-18 expression than both the Fayoumi and Leghorn birds . 
No effect of breed was observed for the apoptosis related genes , BAK and Bcl-x , the proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b , IL-6 , and CXCLi2 , as well as the Th2-inducing cytokine IL-10 .

4. Discussion
We investigated early mRNA expression of cytokine and apoptosis-related genes in day-old chicks of three diverse breeds ( Leghorn , Fayoumi , and broiler ) , from two tissue sources ( spleen and cecum ) , with and without SE challenge , and at two post-inoculation harvest times ( 2 and 18 h ) . 
Splenic IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA expression was higher in SE-exposed chicks . 
These results suggest that avian spleen cells may rapidly respond to Salmonella pathogen exposure , within hours of inoculation , likely inﬂuencing the subsequent host immune response . 
IL-18 promotes IFN-g expression , the hallmark of Th1 immune responses [ 24 ] . 
Previous studies of chicken cells in vitro have shown increased IL-18 mRNA expression in spleen cell cultures in response to LPS stimulation [ 45 ] , and in heterophils from chicken lines cultured with either opsonized o non-opsonized SE [ 42,46 ] . 
Results of SE-enhanced mRNA expression of IL-18 in the whole , in situ spleen provide additional evidence for the role of this Th1 promoting , proinﬂammatory , cytokine in the avian immune response to intracellular patho-gens like Salmonella . 
Additionally , we observed IFN-g mRNA upregulated in the spleen of SE-exposed chicks . 
Taken together , our results show that SE exposure of live young chicks induces the in situ production of splenic Th1 mRNA gene transcripts . 
Our results of SE-induced upregulation of splenic IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA expression do not agree with a previous study [ 19 ] that found IFN-g mRNA expression increased at 7 days post-infection but not at either 1 or 3 day time points . 
These conﬂicting results may be due to choice of Salmonella species , as the current experiment examined the effect of SE on mRNA expression , while Withanage et al. , examined mRNA gene expression after S. typhimurium inoculation , or to different genetics of the chickens studied . 
A signiﬁcant interaction of SE exposure and breed was observed for expression of IL-6 mRNA in the spleen in the current study . 
Leghorns that were exposed to SE produced signiﬁcantly more IL-6 mRNA compared to their unexposed counterparts , while no difference was observed for the broiler or Fayoumi animals exposed or unexposed to SE . 
These results are in accordance with other studies and demonstrate how breed , or genetic line , inﬂuences the immune response to pathogens in chickens . 
Heterophils from SE resistant lines isolated at 1-day of age produced more IL-6 mRNA than heterophils from susceptible lines when cultured with opsonized and non-opsonized SE [ 46 ] . 
Splenocytes from Line 7 and Line P , lines deﬁned as being susceptible to Marek 's disease virus , each were shown to produce higher levels of IL-6 mRNA at 3 -- 5 days post-infection compared to resistant lines 6 and N under similar conditions [ 47 ] . 
The present study was designed to examine early ( 2 and 18 h ) mRNA expression changes associated with in vivo oral inoculation of SE in three genetically diverse breeds of chickens . 
With the exception of IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA expression in the spleen , SE inoculation did not signiﬁcantly affect early mRNA expression in the present study . 
The limited SE-induced mRNA gene expression changes detected in the present study may be a result of the early sampling times . 
SE reaches the cecum in young chicks within 6 -- 12 h of oral inoculation , whereas bacteria require 1 -- 2 days to colonize the spleen and liver [ 19,48 ] . 
In our experimental design , the cecum has likely been exposed to SE and various environmental antigen sources within 18 h , while the spleen has not . 
Therefore , gene mRNA expression in the spleen may represent a constitutive level of mRNA expression for this organ . 
Other studies have shown Salmonella-induced mRNA expression changes at 48 h to several weeks post-exposure [ 17,19,21 ] . 
Expression of CXCLi2 and IL-1b mRNA was enhanced in the cecum of SE-exposed birds at 2 and 6 weeks post-bacterial inoculation [ 17 ] . 
In S. typhimurium infected birds , CCLi2 and IL-1b mRNA expression in the spleen was upregulated at 48 h post-inoculation [ 19 ] . 
Enhanced IL-10 mRNA expression in the cecum and small intestine was observed after 6 days post-infection with E. maxima [ 23 ] . 
Another study found that mRNA expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b , CXCLi2 , and CCLi2 was upregulated in the cecum and jejunum of chickens starting at 3 -- 4 days post-infection with either E. tennela or E. maxima [ 49 ] . 
The role of host genetics on cytokine mRNA expression in the chicken has been investigated primarily in the context of pathogen-induced changes [ 17,46,47 ] . 
In the current study we observed some consistent patterns of mRNA expression among the three chicken breeds and in the two organs examined . 
Leghorns had a higher level of mRNA expression than the broilers for CXCLi2 , IL-10 , IL-12a , and CCLi2 in the spleen . 
In the cecum , however , broilers had a higher level of mRNA expression than the Leghorns for IL-12a , IL-12b , and CCLi2 . 
These organ-speciﬁc mRNA expression patterns are likely a result of several factors including : the natural route of oral antigen exposure , resident cell populations within an organ , and differences in immune function between layer ( Leghorn ) and broiler chickens . 
Histological examinations of the cell populations in the spleen and cecum have been previously reported . 
The spleens of 7-day-old broilers contain approximately 30 % T cells , 20 % B cells , and 12 % macrophages [ 50 ] . 
Therefore , in this experiment , total lymphocytes vastly outnumbered ( approximately 4:1 ) the population of macrophages . 
In another study that examined the area percentage of various cells in the cecum of 2-day-old chicks , this organ contained 3 % macrophages , 1 % T cells , and 0.2 % B cells [ 49 ] . 
Furthermore , upon oral exposure to SE a large inﬂux of macrophages , but not T or B cells , occurred within 10 h. Different cel compositions of these organs may explain the organ-speciﬁc mRNA expression levels observed in the present experiment . 
Macrophages are an important immunological cell type likely to respond upon bacterial exposure in the cecum of young chicks and genetic background inﬂuences macrophage effector function , measured as nitric oxide production [ 50,51 ] . 
In comparison of macrophages from two Leghorn lines , K-strain and G-B2 , the G-B2 birds consistently produced less nitric oxide ( NO ) after stimulation with LPS from a variety of bacterial species . 
The authors postulate that the G-B2 `` hypo-responder '' macrophages have weaker `` LPSmediated signaling via CD14 , TLR4 , and NF-kB '' than the K-strain birds . 
Thus , in an organ that uses macrophages as the primary responding cell , as the cecum , having low macrophage LPS responsiveness may signiﬁcantly skew cytokine mRNA expression levels . 
This may be especially relevant as the `` hypo-responder '' G-B2 birds are from the same highly inbred line of Leghorn chicks used in the present study . 
While showing the Leghorn G-B2 birds have muted macrophage responses , which correlate with the present observation of decreased cecal mRNA levels for IL-12a , IL-12b , and CCLi2 in these animals , speciﬁc cytokine mRNA or protein production was not examined in the prior studies [ 50,51 ] . 
Perhaps not all macrophage effector pathways or responses are equally diminished in the G-B2 Leghorns , and although this remains to be fully elucidated , the present data of higher cecal IL-18 mRNA expression in Leghorns ( compared to broilers ) suggests that a more detailed investigation of G-B2 macrophage function is warranted . 
Alternatively , broiler macrophages may represent an extreme hyper-responsive type . 
Fundamental immunological differences between broiler and layer ( Leghorn ) chickens are well established [ 35,36 ] . 
Gene-expression proﬁles of broiler and layer birds showed that NF-kB was expressed at lower levels in broilers pre - and post-LPS injection compared to layers [ 52 ] . 
Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) activation on antigen presenting cells results in the production of numerous cyto-kines such as IL-12 and IL-10 , and chemokines such as CXCLi2 and CCLi2 , and critical to this innate immune response is the signal transduction mole-cule , NF-kB [ 53,54 ] . 
The lower expression of NF-kB may help to explain our results of lower splenic mRNA expression , of broilers versus layers for proinﬂammatory chemokines , CXCLi2 and CCLi2 , and the Th1 ( IL-12a ) or Th2 ( IL-10 ) promoting cytokines observed in the current experiment . 
Oral inoculation with SE had limited effects on early mRNA expression in the spleen and cecum of day-old chicks from the three breeds examined . 
The current study , however , provides strong evidence of genetic inﬂuence on immunological gene expression , as well as providing additional information on the immunological differences between broiler , layer ( Leghorn ) , and Fayoumi chickens .
