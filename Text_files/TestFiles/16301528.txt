Identification of YdgT in Salmonella . 
YmoA and Hha belong to an emerging family of transcriptional regulators that negatively modulate bacterial virulence gene expression ( 21 ) . 
YmoA modulates the expression of Yersinia virulence factors including Yop proteins , the YadA adhesin , and invasin ( 25 , 26 ) . 
Hha , originally defined as a hemolysin expression modulating protein in Esch-erichia coli ( 27 ) , negatively regulates SPI-1 virulence genes in Salmonella ( 5 ) and virulence genes in the locus of enterocyte effacement in enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( 28 ) . 
We screened the Salmonella genome using BLAST to identify putative regulatory genes that shared similarity to the YmoA Hha family of proteins . 
We identified a Salmonella gene designated ydgT ( STM1461 ) , located 38 ORFs downstream of the SPI-2-encoded gene ssaU . 
ydgT is annotated as a putative cytoplasmic protein in S. enterica and is transcriptionally repressed during early intracellular infection of macrophages ( 4 h ) , but is slightly induced after 8 h of infection ( 29 ) . 
YdgT shows 39 % identity to Yersinia YmoA and 35 % identity to Hha over the entire length of 71 aa ( Fig. 1 ) . 
YdgT Is Involved in Repression of SPI-2 Transcription . 
The presence of a ymoA hha homologue that is transcriptionally repressed during early intracellular infection when SPI-2 is activated lead us to hypothesize that YdgT might be involved in negatively modulating SPI-2 . 
To test this possibility , we constructed a nonpolar , in-frame deletion of the ydgT gene , which did not affect the phenotype of Salmonella growing on solid media or in various liquid media ( data not shown ) . 
We then introduced into wild-type and ydgT backgrounds a chromosomal transcriptional reporter containing the SPI-2 promoter region upstream of sseA , driving expression of a promoterless lacZ cassette , and measured - galactosidase activity in whole cell lysates . 
Loss of ydgT significantly increased sseA promoter activity compared to wild type in LPM , pH 7.0 ( Fig. 2A ) , a condition in which SPI-2 transcriptional activity is low ( 23 ) . 
ydgT mutants grown in LPM at pH 5.8 , a condition that induces expression and secretion of SPI-2-encoded proteins ( 18 , 23 , 30 ) , also exhibited a significant increase in - galactosidase activity ( Fig. 2 A ) , indicating that the repressive effect of YdgT can occur under both neutral pH and acidic conditions . 
Expression and Secretion of SPI-2 Proteins in ydgT Mutants . 
Next , we examined SPI-2 protein levels in the ydgT mutant compared to wild type . 
Cell lysates and secreted proteins from bacteria cultured in LPM were analyzed for SseD and SseB , the poreforming and filament components of the SPI-2 type III apparatus , respectively . 
ydgT mutants showed increased accumulation of SseD ( Fig. 2B ) and SseB ( data not shown ) in whole cell lysates compared to wild type . 
This increase was evident when bacteria were grown under conditions that normally limit early SPI-2 activation , such as growth in LPM medium at neutral pH , but also under SPI-2-inducing conditions when the external medium was acidified after growth at neutral pH. SseD ( Fig. 2C ) and SseB ( not shown ) were secreted in a type III-dependent manner in greater abundance from the ydgT mutant compared to the other strain backgrounds , which likely reflected the higher intracellular levels of these SPI-2 substrates . 
Importantly , enhanced SPI-2 type III secretion occurred only when the external medium was acidified and not at neutral pH , as acidification is necessary for SPI-2 secretion ( 30 , 31 ) . 
We verified this phenotype by examining another nonsecreted SPI-2 protein , SseE ( 23 ) , which accumulated in the ydgT mutant but not in wild-type bacteria or the SPI-2 apparatus mutant , ssaR ( Fig. 2D ) . 
To test whether the loss of ydgT could overcome the requirement for positive regulation of SPI-2 , we introduced the ydgT deletion into an ssrB mutant lacking the response regulator of the SsrA SsrB two-component regulatory system . 
SPI-2 protein production was eliminated in the ssrB ydgT double mutant ( data not shown ) , indicating that SPI-2 activation requires SsrB even in the absence of YdgT . 
ydgT Mutants Are Attenuated for Virulence in a Mouse Model of Systemic Typhoid . 
Few studies ( 5 , 32 ) have examined the in vivo phenotypes associated with loss or overexpression of a molecule that negatively modulates a pathogenicity island containing a T3SS . 
To assess the role of YdgT in virulence , we infected mice i.p. with wild-type bacteria , ydgT mutants , and ydgT ssrB double mutants and examined survival of the infected animals . 
The mean survival time was greater for mice infected with the ydgT mutant ( 7.6 days ) compared to wild-type bacteria ( 4.4 days ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Inactivation of ssrB in the ydgT background resulted in complete loss of virulence during systemic infection , consistent with the finding that deletion of ydgT does not override the requirement of SsrB for transcriptional activation of the SPI-2 pathogenicity island . 
Deletion of ydgT Enhances Early Survival in Macrophages . 
SPI-2 activity contributes to intracellular survival and replication in macrophages ( 33 , 34 ) . 
Because deletion of ydgT seemed to uncouple SPI-2 regulation , we infected RAW264 .7 mouse mac-rophages and HeLa epithelial cells with wild-type Salmonella or ssaR and ydgT mutants and examined invasion and intracellular survival . 
In macrophages , the numbers of viable intracellular ydgT mutants was significantly higher ( 420 % ) during the initial 2 h of infection compared to wild type ( 100 % ) and the SPI-2 mutant strain , ssaR ( 60 % ) ( Fig. 3B ) . 
This increase was not due to differences in phagocytic uptake because the number of intracellular bacteria 15 min after infection was not different between the Salmonella strains ( not shown ) . 
In longer infection experiments , the ydgT mutant displayed an attenuated intracellular phenotype , whereas wild-type Salmonella replicated to expected levels over a similar time period ( Fig. 3B ) . 
In contrast , invasion and early survival of the ydgT mutant in epithelial cells , a process that is SPI-2-independent , was not different to wild type or ssaR mutants at various times after infection ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Together , these data suggest that enhanced SPI-2 activity in the ydgT mutant might promote early intracellular survival in mac-rophages during a time when wild-type bacteria are still adapting to the intracellular environment . 
We examined this hypothesis in vivo by using a competitive murine infection model of systemic typhoid . 
Loss of Negative SPI-2 Regulation Results in Biphasic Virulence in Vivo . 
Intramacrophage survival and replication allows Salmonella to colonize the mouse spleen and liver ( 35 -- 37 ) . 
Because in vitro experiments demonstrated an early survival phenotype in mac-rophages for ydgT mutants , we examined this at different times during in vivo infection . 
CI experiments ( 38 ) performed with wild-type Salmonella and ydgT mutants in mixed infections of the same animal indicated that the ydgT mutant had an early survival advantage in the reticuloendothelial system compared to wildtype bacteria that was evident in all systemic organs examined ( Fig. 4A ) . 
However , this advantage was lost during the course of infection , with the ydgT mutant being recovered in significantly lower numbers compared to wild type , which comprised 90 % of the output pool in all organs . 
The Early ydgT Phenotype in Vivo Depends on SPI-2 Activity . 
To test whether the enhanced early virulence of ydgT mutants occurred through SPI-2 , we performed CI experiments between an ssrB ydgT double mutant and each of the ssrB and ydgT single mutants . 
The competitive indices of ydgT mutants versus ssrB ydgT double mutants reached as high as 20 ( Fig. 4B ) , indicating that the early enhanced survival phenotype was abolished by removal of the SPI-2 activator , SsrB . 
In contrast , competitive indices of ssrB mutants versus ssrB ydgT double mutants were near unity ( Fig. 4C ) , consistent with our observation that loss of ydgT does not supersede SsrB for SPI-2 expression and that deletion of ydgT does not confer any additional advantage in the absence of SsrB . 
Overexpression of ydgT Attenuates Systemic Virulence . 
In CI experiments , we tested whether overexpression of ydgT would affect the early SPI-2-dependent `` gain-of-virulence '' phenotype of ydgT mutants . 
Overexpression of ydgT eliminated the early phenotype of the ydgT mutant at 24 h , significantly reducing the competitive indices relative to wild type ( Fig. 5A ) . 
Overexpression of ydgT in wild-type bacteria also reduced the competitive indices relative to the vector alone to 0.15 0.04 and 0.20 0.05 in the liver and spleen , respectively . 
Furthermore , overexpression of YdgT decreased SseD secretion compared to the ydgT mutant strain ( Fig. 5B ) , suggesting that overexpressing YdgT reduces SPI-2 gene expression below a critical threshold required for efficient systemic infection . 
Transcriptional Profiling of SPI-2 in ydgT Mutants . 
Because deletion of ydgT lead to an early SPI-2-dependent increase in virulence , we used arrays to profile SPI-2 transcripts from wild-type Salmonella , SPI-2-positive regulator mutants ( ssrB ) , and ydgT mutants grown under SPI-2-inducing conditions . 
Among the 32 structural , regulatory , effector , and chaperone genes encoded in SPI-2 , all were down-regulated in the ssrB mutant and robustly expressed in the ydgT mutant . 
In the ydgT mutant compared to wild type , 7 of the 32 type III secretion-associated genes were up-regulated between 2 and 6-fold , 18 were up-regulated between 1.2 and 1.9-fold , and seven genes were expressed at similar levels between wild-type Salmonella and ydgT mutants ( Fig. 6A ) . 
Among the more highly abundant transcripts were those from the `` structural II '' operon including ssaV and STM1410 ( named ssaX here ) , the `` structural I '' operon ( ssaC , ssaD ) , and the `` effector chaperone '' operon ( sseC , sseF , sseG ) . 
Previously , Cirillo et al. ( 36 ) also noted high-level expression in macrophages of transcriptional GFP fusions to targets in the structural I and II operons , suggesting some temporal order to SPI-2 expression . 
In contrast , transcriptional profiling of T3SS genes in the SPI-1 pathogenicity island did not reveal obvious clustering patterns in the pair-wise comparisons ( Fig. 6B ) , consistent with the SPI-1-dependent phenotypes observed in cell culture . 
Discussion In Salmonella , the SPI-2 pathogenicity island and its related type III effectors are required for survival and replication in macro-phages in the reticuloendothelial system . 
Although activators of SPI-2 are well documented , essentially nothing is known about how this pathogenicity island is repressed during stages of infection that are incongruous with SPI-2 activation or how the system is down-regulated once activated in host cells . 
Because SPI-2 lacks an obvious negative regulator , we hypothesized that the SPI-2 pathogenicity island integrates with ancestral negative regulatory proteins to achieve appropriate genetic control . 
Here , we identified and characterized a negative modulator of the SPI-2 pathogenicity island and established that negative regulation of SPI-2 is central to typhoid pathogenesis because overexpression of virulence genes required for typhoid reduced the systemic virulence of bacteria during infection in vivo . 
Although positive regulation of virulence genes is required for pathogenesis in animals , repression of virulence gene expression until the proper host environment is sensed appears to be similarly crucial for bacterial virulence . 
This notion has been largely unstudied in in vivo models of bacterial infection , although Salmonella mutants in which the global response regulator PhoP is constitutively active ( 32 ) are attenuated for virulence in animals . 
This attenuation might be linked to the negative effect of PhoP on the SPI-1 invasion locus or , more related to this work , the observed positive effect of PhoP on ssrB expression ( 39 ) . 
Derepression of SPI-2 gene expression by loss of ydgT resulted in an early gain-of-virulence suggesting that preformed SPI-2 gene products might enable mutant bacteria to better subvert early antibacterial effector mechanisms of the host . 
In support of this , others ( 40 ) demonstrated that stabilization of virulence gene mRNA through mutation of polynucleotide phosphorylase impacts virulence phenotypes during infection . 
However , attenuation of the ydgT mutant during infection progression suggests that inappropriate expression of type III virulence traits ultimately attenuates virulence . 
An evolving concept in Salmonella pathogenesis posits that these bacteria induce responses to temper their intracellular growth rate to establish persistence ( 41 , 42 ) , arguing that SPI-2 should be dampened after establishing an intracellular niche . 
That moderate ydgT induction is seen in macrophages later in infection , coinciding with a reduction in SPI-2 gene expression ( 29 ) , suggests that the attenuation of ydgT mutants later in infection could be related to the importance of reducing bacterial intracellular growth rate during infection ( Fig. 6D ) and the inability of the ydgT mutant to effectively do so ( Fig. 6E ) . 
The differences in in vitro and in vivo timing of the ydgT phenotype is likely due to the relatively synchronized infection that occurs in cell culture and the lack of this synchronization during infection of animals . 
Thus , the early virulence phenotype in animals is perceptible over a slightly longer time frame . 
One question arising from this work concerns the regulatory mechanisms governing control of virulence genes acquired by horizontal transfer . 
Although transcription of SPI-2 promoters requires the SPI-2-encoded two-component system of SsrA SsrB , negative control is achieved , in part , by ancestral YdgT encoded outside of SPI-2 . 
Similar proteins , including YmoA ( 25 , 26 ) and Hha ( 5 , 28 ) , also perform negative regulatory roles for virulence gene expression in pathogenic bacteria . 
A common mode of action of these proteins might be through H-NS , a global repressor of gene expression in bacteria ( 43 -- 45 ) . 
H-NS-mediated gene repression is thought to occur nonspecifically at regions of DNA curvature ( 46 ) . 
However , the observation that E. coli YdgT ( 47 ) , Hha ( 22 , 48 ) , and Yersinia YmoA ( 22 ) can bind to the N-terminal oligomerization domain of H-NS suggests that regulatory specificity might be achieved through interaction with accessory proteins . 
That the H-NS oligomerization domain also contributes to DNA binding ( 49 ) supports the idea that DNA-binding specificity of H-NS could be modulated by heteromeric interactions with such proteins . 
We ( B.K.C. and B.B.F. , unpublished data ) and others ( 50 ) attempted to generate H-NS mutants in S. enterica SL1344 , but the resulting strains displayed an aberrant mucoid phenotype , likely because of the adverse effect on chromosome structure . 
Thus , defining potential DNA consensus sequences for this family of regulators and their heteromeric combinations may aid in the identification of additional virulence genes that require strict regulatory control . 
An indirect effect on SPI-2 can not be ruled out for YdgT and , given the large number of negative regulators described for SPI-1 , we predict other repressor molecules to play a role in exerting genetic control over SPI-2-mediated virulence . 
Other putative regulators might act in conjunction with YdgT , because transcriptional profiling of ydgT mutants indicated modest SPI-2 induction compared to wild type , more consistent with a virulence fine-tuning mechanism rather than an absolute requirement . 
A fine-tuning mechanism is also suggested because a ydgT-null mutant , although attenuated compared to wild type in single infections , retains some degree of virulence during systemic infection . 
However , the virulence defect becomes striking when the ydgT mutant is coinfected with wild-type bacteria in the
