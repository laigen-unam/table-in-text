Received 27 July 2007/Accepted 13 November 2007 
We describe a transcriptomic study of the effect of hha and ydgT mutations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
A large number of genes showing altered expression are located in AT-rich horizontally acquired DNA sequences . 
Many of these genes have also been reported to be targets for H-NS . 
As Hha and YdgT interact with H-NS , our ﬁndings strongly suggest that Hha and/or YdgT must form complexes with H-NS when they silence these DNA regions . 
The genomes of all members of genera belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae contain at least one copy of a gene that encodes a member of the Hha-YmoA family of proteins ( 23 , 24 ) . 
These low-molecular-mass proteins show high degrees of similarity , and all of them have been identiﬁed as modulators of the expression of virulence factors ( 7 , 30 ) . 
Hha regulates , among other genes , expression of Escherichia colihemolysin and esp operons ( 23 , 29 , 31 , 36 ) , the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium hilA modulator of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 14 , 32 ) , and virulence genes in SPI2 ( 37 ) . 
The Hha paralogue YdgT contributes to modulation of virulence genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI2 ( 6 , 37 ) . 
The YmoA protein regulates the expression of several Yersinia virulence factors , as well as the RovA transcriptional activator ( 7 , 13 , 27 ) . 
The Hha-YmoA proteins are encoded exclusively in the genomes of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in conjugative plasmids isolated from these organisms ( 24 ) . 
Cells in which Hha has been depleted exhibit phenotypic properties similar to those of cells lacking the nucleoid-associated protein ( NAP ) H-NS , and it has been proposed that Hha-like proteins represent a new class of NAPs ( 27 ) . 
Several lines of evidence have shown that proteins belonging to the Hha family interact with members of the H-NS family to modulate gene expression ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 31 , 32 , 33 ) . 
Hha-like proteins mimic the H-NS oligomerization domain ( 23 , 30 ) , and interaction of Hha with H-NS increases the repressive ability of H-NS ( 25 , 31 ) . 
H-NS is the most extensively studied example of a NAP that has a role as an environmentally dependent modulator of gene expression ( 11 , 35 ) . 
H-NS is considered a transcriptional repressor , playing a relevant role in silencing xenogeneic DNA ( 12 , 22 , 28 , 34 ) . 
It remains to be determined whether the set of H-NS-regu -

lated genes coincides with the set of Hha-regulated genes or whether the latter is simply a subset of the former . 
A genome-wide analysis of the modulatory role of Hha-like proteins has not been performed . 
Here we describe a transcriptomic study of the effect of depletion of Hha-like proteins in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and provide evidence that one of the main targets for Hha and/or its paralogue YdgT are the genes in horizontally acquired DNA sequences that are silenced by H-NS . 
The genome of Salmonella contains , in addition to hha , a copy of the ydgT gene , which codes for an Hha paralogue , YdgT . 
When cells grow under nonstress conditions , YdgT does not signiﬁcantly contribute to modulation . 
Nevertheless , this protein is overexpressed in hha mutants , which attenuates the hha phenotype ( 33 ) . 
To prevent attenuation , we used a double hha ydgT mutant ( strain SV5015HY ) . 
This deletion mutant , obtained by gene replacement , was constructed as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 9 ) . 
To obtain the ydgT mutant , the antibiotic resistance of plasmid pKD4 ( kanamycin ) was ampli-ﬁed using primers YDGTKAM1 and YDGTKAM2 . 
To obtain the hha mutant , the antibiotic resistance of plasmid pKD3 ( chloramphenicol ) was ampliﬁed using primers HHAP1 and HHAP2 . 
Both constructions were veriﬁed by using primers YDGTSA and YDGTSA2 , primers HHA3 and HHA5 , and primers corresponding to pKD3 ( c1/c2 ) and pKD4 sequences ( k1/k2 ) ( primer sequences are described in Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
Strain SV5015HY ( hha ydgT ) was obtained by P22 HT transduction of the hha deletion into the ydgT strain ( Table 1 ) . 
Transcriptomic analyses were performed by using a Salmonella microarray that contained 6,119 probes corresponding to 5,116 open reading frames , 21 rRNAs , 86 tRNAs , 51 small RNAs , and 845 intergenic regions . 
The methods used for RNA extraction , retrotranscription , labeling , hybridization , microarray scanning , and data analysis will be described elsewhere ( J. F. Mariscotti and F. Garcıa del Portillo , submitted for publication ) . 
Compared to the wild-type ( wt ) strain , strain SV5015HY showed altered expression of about 1,000 genes . 
The mRNA levels of 471 genes were 2-fold higher in the hha ydgT mutant , indicating that Hha and YdgT repress gene expression in the wt strain . 
The mRNA levels of 504 genes were 2-fold lower in the mutant strain , indicating

that Hha and YdgT activate gene expression in the wt strain ( see Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material ) . 
Upregulation predominated in genes belonging to several functional categories , including genomic islands ( SPI1 to SPI5 and other genes related to horizontally acquired DNA regions ) , and the pSLT plasmid . 
In contrast , down-regulation predominated in genes belonging to the surface structure , cell motilitysecretion , and translation functional categories ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Most of the genes in SPI1 to SPI5 ( 93.22 % of the genes ) were predominantly overexpressed in strain SV5015HY ( Table 2 ) . 
To conﬁrm the transcriptomic results obtained , we used reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR to analyze the mRNA levels of some of the genes that were differentially expressed . 
Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) and primer pairs shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material were used . 
The genes selected were prgH ( which encodes a component of the needle complex of the type III secretion apparatus of SPI1 ) , hilC and invF ( which encode invasion regulatory proteins of SPI1 ) , sseB ( which encodes a component of the translocation machinery of SPI2 ) , and ssrA/ssrB ( which encodes a two-component regulatory system of SPI2 ) . 
RT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed overexpression of all these genes in strain SV5015HY ( Fig. 2 ) . 
To examine the effect of deregulation of virulence genes in the SPIs , we used the competitive index ( 2 ) . 
Equivalent numbers of cells from strains SV5015 and SV5015HY were combined and used to inoculate an animal host ( BALB/c mice ) ( input ) . 
Bacteria were recovered after 48 h from the spleen and liver ( output ) , and the competitive index was determined . 
The competitive indexes were 0.08 0.05 and 0.05 0.03 in spleen and liver homogenates , respectively . 
As previously reported for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 ( 6 , 37 ) , the hha and ydgT alleles are responsible for an attenuated virulence phenotype . 
Several ( 42.52 % ) of the putative open reading frames in the virulence plasmid pSLT exhibited altered expression in strain SV5015HY . 
Most of them ( 97 % ) , including those in the tra operon , were overexpressed ( Table 2 ) . 
To further examine the effect of the hha and ydgT mutations on conjugation of plasmid pSLT , mating experiments were performed using a conjuga-tion-derepressed derivative of plasmid pSLT , ﬁnO : : Km ( 4 ) . 
The antibiotic resistance cassettes associated with hha ( chlor-amphenicol ) and ydgT ( kanamycin ) mutations in strain SV5015HY were ﬁrst deleted . 
To do this , we used FLP recombinase of plasmid pCP20 ( 9 ) and obtained strain SV5015HY-2 . 
P22 HT transduction was used to transfer the ﬁnO : : Km allele from plasmid pSLT of SV4478 into SV5015 and SV5015HY-2 , generating strains SV5015-ﬁnO and SV5015HY-2-ﬁnO , respectively . 
The recipient used in the mating experiments was strain SV3081 , a pSLT-cured strain , which was transformed with plasmid pLG338-30 to confer ampicillin resistance for selection of transconjugants . 
The frequency of plasmid transfer was calculated per donor bacterium . 
The frequency of pSLT FinO plasmid transfer was 10-fold higher when strain SV5015HY-2 was used as the donor than when the wt strain was used as the donor ( 1.75 10 4 and 1.84 10 5 , respectively ) . 
These results show that the Hha-YdgT proteins participate in the regulation of plasmid pSLT conjugation . 
The par ticipation of Hha-like proteins in the modulation of conjugative plasmid transfer has also been reported previously for the IncH1 plasmid R27 ( 15 ) . 
These results show that Hha-like proteins negatively modulate the expression of horizontally acquired genes in enteric bacteria , either directly or indirectly . 
This observation coincides with data for target genes previously described for Hhalike proteins ( 23 ) . 
Hha-YdgT may negatively modulate gene expression either directly or indirectly . 
A good example of this is the virulence genes of SPI1 ; Hha modulates the master regulator , the hilA gene ( 14 , 20 ) . 
Genes showing reduced expression in strain SV5015HY belong to several functional categories . 
The decreased expression of many of these genes may be due to an indirect effect of the double mutation on cell physiology ( most likely the genes in the translation , ribosome structure , and biogenesis functional categories ) or on speciﬁc transcriptional repressors . 
Remarkably , one signiﬁcant set of genes showing reduced expression includes many genes involved in ﬂagellar biogenesis ( Table 2 ) . 
We also used RT-PCR to conﬁrm deregulation of ﬂgB , which encodes a ﬂagellar basal body rod protein ( Fig. 2 ) . 
We also compared strains SV5015 and SV5015HY in motility agar plates ( 18 ) . 
Strain SV5015HY formed a very small halo ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This phenotype was complemented by expressing a plasmid that contains hha ( pUBM22 ) . 
Neither hha nor ydgT single mutants exhibited the drastic effect on motility shown by the hha ydgT double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
Hence , the lower expression of several ﬂagellar genes in strain SV5015HY resulted in reduced motility . 
The doubling time in LB medium of SV5015HY was 40 % lower than that of the wt strain . 
The decrease in the growth rate may be explained by the downregulation of the genes involved in translation , ribosomes , and biogenesis , as shown in the transcriptomic analysis ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Nevertheless , the difference in the doubling times of the strains analyzed is not sufﬁcient to explain the difference in the reduced halos formed in motility plates . 
Hha-like proteins form nucleoprotein complexes with H-NS ( 13 , 15 , 23 , 30 , 33 ) . 
Recent results presented independently by different groups have shown that this NAP silences the expression of horizontally acquired DNA under nonpermissive conditions ( 22 , 28 , 34 ) . 
Hence , a signiﬁcant set of genes that are silenced by H-NS should also be silenced by Hha-YdgT . 
To conﬁrm this , we compared the reported H-NS binding sites in the Salmonella genome ( 28 ) and our transcriptomic data . 
The results ( Table 2 ) clearly support the hypothesis that Hha and YdgT interact with H-NS to favor silencing of xenogeneic DNA . 
Although these results were obtained with two different Salmonella strains ( SV5015 and 14028 ) and the experimental approaches differed , 87 % of SPI genes were repressed by Hha-YdgT and are reported to contain binding sites for H-NS . 
The coincidence is also high for other SV5015HY up-regulated genes on other genomic islands ( 34 % ) and for the pSLT plasmid ( 46 % ) . 
It has been suggested that H-NS is not an effective silencer at all binding sites for some horizontally transferred sequences ( 28 ) . 
This suggestion is supported by our ﬁnding that Hha-like proteins also participate in silencing xenogeneic DNA . 
Coregulation of genes in SPIs by H-NS and Hha-YdgT can be also inferred from two recent independent reports . 
The Hha and YdgT proteins repress expression of SPI2 virulence genes ( 37 ) . 
Furthermore , H-NS down-regulates SPI2 expression , in competition with the two-component activator system SsrA-SsrB ( 40 ) . 
The results reported here show that the Hha and YdgT proteins also repress ssrA and ssrB expression , thereby supporting the hypothesis that the Hha/H-NS complex modulates SPI2 gene expression . 
For many other functional categories , the coincidence between Hha-regulated genes and H-NS-regulated genes was low . 
This ﬁnding can probably be attributed to H-NS modulating housekeeping functions in the absence of Hha-YdgT or to indirect effects of the double hha ydgT mutation on cell physiology . 
Some well-characterized examples of H-NS-mod-ulated operons are bgl and proU ( 10 , 21 ) . 
We have been unabl to show that Hha-YdgT modulates these operons ( unpublished results ) . 
We therefore suggest that the regulatory regions of the H-NS target genes include two categories : genes for which H-NS requires the formation of heteromeric complexes with Hha-like proteins in order to achieve efﬁcient repression and genes repressed by H-NS homooligomers . 
Many of the H-NS-modulated genes that are located in horizontally acquired DNA , among others , belong to the ﬁrst category . 
The mechanism by which H-NS activates gene expression is not well characterized . 
This is also the case for Hha-YdgT . 
Nevertheless , we also found coincidences between genes down-regulated in strain SV5015HY and genes down-regu-lated in hns mutants . 
Genes related to ﬂagellar biogenesis are positively regulated by H-NS in E. coli or Salmonella ( 1 , 28 ) . 
Our transcriptomic analysis showed that the Hha and YdgT proteins also positively regulate ﬂagellar genes . 
Again , these ﬁndings point to participation of Hha-like proteins in some of the cellular processes that require H-NS .
