AIM : To explore effects of huoxiangzhengqi liquid ( HXZQ ) on enteric mucosal immune responses in mice with Bacillus dysenteriae and Salmonella typhimurium induced diarrhea ( BSD ) . 
METHODS : BSD was induced in Balb/c mice by oral administration with Bacillus dysenteriae and Salmonella typhimurium . 
HXZQ was administrated from the day of diarrhea induction at dosages of 5.21 g/kg and 0.52 g/kg , respectively . 
The onset of diarrhea and lasting time were recorded . 
Peyer 's patches and peripheral lymphocytes were prepared for flow cytometry , and levels of TNF-α in peripheral blood and enteric tissue homogenates were determined with ELISA . 
Student 's t test was employed for statistics . 
RESULTS : M i c e i n B S D g r o u p s t a r t e d s h o w i n g continuous diarrhea on the day of induction until the fourth day when they were sacrificed . 
Diarrhea in the mice of HXZQ high and low dose groups lasted for 36 and 54 h , respectively . 
There were more CD4 + and CD8 + cells in peripheral blood , fewer CD4 + cells in Peyer 's patches in BSD mice compared to normal mice . 
Fewer CD4 + and CD8 + cells was shown in the mice in HXZQ high group compared to BSD mice . 
In Peyer 's patch , there were more CD8 + cells in mice in HXZQ high and low dose groups and more CD4 + in mice in HXZQ high group . 
Higher levels of TNF-α in peripheral blood and intestinal tissue homogenates in BSD group were observed . 
Mice in HXZQ high group showed decreased levels of TNF-α in peripheral blood and enteric tissue homogenates . 
CONCLUSION : The immune regulation of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in Peyer 's patch and suppression of TNF-α levels in enteric homogenates may partially explain the effect of HXZQ on improvement of BSD .

INTRODUCTION
Huoxiangzhengqi liquid ( HXZQ ) , consisting of Agastache r ugosa , Ammi majus , areca peel , hoelen , beefsteak plant leaf , aurantii nobilis pericarpium , atractylodes macrocephala , magnolia bark , pinelliae tuber , platycodon root and Glycyrrhiza uralensis , has been used in China for thousands of years for the treatment of various diarrhea [ 1 ] . 
It is one of earliest marketed herbal medicines and is produced by China Tongrentang Pharmaceuticals Corp ( GMP certificated ) , Beijing . 
Pharmacological research has shown that HXZQ has the activities of improving gastrointestinal dysfunction , anti-inflammation and [ 1-3 ] immune regulation . 
Enteric mucosal responses play an important role in anti-inflammation of the digestive tract [ 4,5 ] . 
However , the effects of HXZQ on enteric mucosal immune responses are largely unknown . 
Dysenteriae and Salmonella typhimurium induced diarrhea ( BSD ) is one of widely used animal models for human infectious diarrhea study [ 6,7 ] . 
In the present study , we investigated the effects of huoxiangzhengqi liquid on enteric mucosal immune responses in mice with BSD . 
MATERIALS AND Animals
Forty Balb/c mice , female and male in equal number , 8-10 wk old , were purchased from the Research Institute of Experimental Animals , Chinese Academy of Medical Science , Beijing . 
Mice were randomly divided into four groups with 10 in each group : control group ( Control ) , BSD group , Huoxiangzhengqi liquid treated BSD groups at high dosage and low dosage ( HXZQ high , HXZQ low ) . 
Mice were housed in a temperature - , humidity - and lightcontrolled environment with free access to rodent chow and water . 
The light-dark cycle was 12 h :12 h with the light phase from 06:00 am to 18:00 pm . 
Induction of BSD
METHODS
BSD were induced by oral administration with sodium ampicillin ( Northern China Pharmaceutical Limited Company , Guangzhou , China ) at a dosage of 20 g/kg body weight , and 8 h later , were orally administered with Bacillus dysenteriae and Salmonella typhimurium ( National Institute for Control of Drugs and Biological Products , Beijing , China ) at the proportion of 1:1 with 0.2 mL / mouse ( concentration at 1010 CFU/mL ) . 
Mice in BSD , HXZQ high , and HXZQ low groups were induced with BSD , and mice in Control group were treated with equal volume physiological saline . 
The onset of diarrhea and its lasting time were recorded as previously reported [ 6,7 ] . 
Treatment of BSD with HXZQ
The administrations of HXZQ started from the day of induction of BSD , once a day for three days . 
The dosage of HXZQ was determined according to our in vitro tests , and the doses at 5.21 g ( crude herbal drug ) / kg body weight and 0.52 g/kg were used for the mice in HXZQ high and HXZQ low groups , respectively , in a volume of 10 mL/kg . 
The mice in control group and BSD group were administered with the same volume of saline . 
Preparation of Peyer’s patch cell suspension
The mice were sacrificed on the fourth day after the treatment . 
Peyer 's patch cells were separately harvested according to Lyscom 's method [ 8 ] . 
Briefly , the tissues were mechanically dissociated into phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
Lymphocytes were isolated by density centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque ( Lymphoprep , Nycomed , Olso , Norway ) . 
The lymphocytes were collected by repeated centrifugation at 463 rpm for 5 min after the tissues were washed twice with PBS and then suspended in PBS at a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL for flow cytometry . 
Preparation of peripheral lymphocytes
Whole blood samples were collected before the mice were sacrificed , and suspended in tubes containing 25 μL heparin ( 5000 IU/mL ) . 
Erythrocytes were lysed in a buffer containing 0.84 % NH4Cl at pH 7.4 for 3-5 min . 
The remaining cells were then washed in saline twice , and resuspended for flow cytometry . 
Preparation of enteric tissue homogenates
Colons were washed and put into homogenate medium ( dehydrated alcohol and saline at a ratio of 1:4 ) at 300 g/L . 
After mixed sufficiently , they were placed at 4 ℃ for 2 h , and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min . 
The supernatant was collected , and stored at 4 ℃ for ELISA . 
Flow cytometry for CD4+ and CD8+
Flow cytometry was perfor med on freshly isolated plasma lymphocytes and Peyer 's patch cell suspension . 
Immunofluorescence staining of cell surface markers was performed using R-Phycoerythrin ( PE ) - conjugated OX-38 ( BD Biosciences Pharmingen ) for CD4 + staining , Peridinin Chlorophyll-a Protein ( PerCP ) - conjugated OX-8 ( BD Biosciences Pharmingen ) for CD8 + staining . 
Each sample of 0.1 mL peripheral lymphocytes or Peyer 's patch cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 ℃ in the dark , with a solution consisting of 6 μL PBS 0.01 mol/L and an appropriate concentration of antibodies . 
After washing in saline , the cells were resuspended and fixed . 
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using an FACS Caliburflow cytometer utilizing CELLQuest software ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) . 
Analysis was carried out on 1 × 104 cells for each sample . 
ELISA for TNF-α
Detection of TNF-α in peripheral blood and intestinal tissue homogenates was conducted with ELISA kit ( Cat . 
No.88-7340 eBioscience , Inc ) according to instructions of the manuals . 
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SD . 
ANOVA was used to determine significance in the data set . 
Student-Newman-Keuls test was employed for variables between both groups when equal variances were assumed and Dunnetts 's t test when equal variances not assumed . 
P < 0.05 was taken as significant . 
RESULTS Incidence and lasting time of diarrhea
After induction of BSD , all mice showed diarrhea within 6 h on the day of induction . 
The diarrhea in the mice in BSD group lasted until the fourth day when the mice were sacrificed . 
Diarrhea lasting time of the mice in HXZQ high and HXZQ low groups were 36 and 54 h , respectively . 
Changes of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in peripheral blood and Peyer 's patch Figure 1 shows that there were more CD4 + and CD8 + cells in BSD mice in periphery ( P < 0.05 vs control group ) , less CD4 + and more CD8 + cells in Peyer 's patch ( P < 0.05 vs control group ) . 
Less CD4 + and CD8 + cells showed in the mice in HXZQ high group ( P < 0.05 vs BSD group ) , and less CD8 + cells in HXZQ low group ( P < 0.05 vs BSD group ) in periphery . 
In Peyer 's patch , there were more CD8 + cells in mice in HXZQ high and low groups ( P < 0.05 vs BSD group ) , and more CD4 + in mice in HXZQ high group ( P < 0.05 vs BSD group ) . 
TNF-α in peripheral blood and intestinal tissue homo-genates Table 1 shows that there were higher levels of TNF - in α peripheral blood and intestinal tissue homogenates in BSD group ( P < 0.05 vs control group ) . 
Mice in HXZQ high group showed decreased levels of TNF - in peripheral α blood and enteric tissue homogenates ( P < 0.05 vs BSD group ) , and mice in HXZQ low group showed decreased levels of TNF - in enteric tissue homogenates ( P < 0.05 α vs BSD group ) . 
DISCUSSION
HXZQ is one of ancient compound liquids of traditional Chinese herbal preparations . 
In China , it has been used for the effective treatment of various common gastrointestinal infectious diseases ( GID ) , such as acute gastroenteritis , diarrhea and gastrointestinal type Frigorism [ 1 ] . 
It has been reported that HXZQ can promote gastroenteric motility , ameliorate myoelectricity of enteric smooth muscle and regulate gastrointestinal function [ 2 ] . 
Huoxiangzhengqi liquid has also been shown to have regulatory effects on specific immune responses [ 3 ] . 
Agastache rugosa is the essential component of huoxiangzhengqi liquid , and the extract of Agastache rugosa has been reported to have [ 9-15 ] immune modulatory activities . 
BSD in mice is induced by administration of attacking pathogenic bacteria , and [ 6,7 ] shares similar pathogenesis and symptoms with GID . 
Our study showed that HXZQ at 5.21 g/kg and 0.521 g/kg could significantly ameliorate diarrhea in BSD mice . 
Although bacteria are usually regarded as harmful , it is now recognized that the breakdown or a failure of components of the indigenous microflora is responsible for allergic diseases or food enteropathies [ 8-10 ] . 
Intestinal microbial species and its product can partially modulate mucosal immune responses and influence the expansion and structure of lymphoid tissues , the activation of

TH1 and TH2 T cells . 
Intestinal bacteria are required for the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues ( GALT ) , which mediate a variety of host immune functions , such as mucosal immunity and oral tolerance [ 13 ] . 
Peyer 's patch lymphocytes , as one important part of GALT , are considered to be the effectors in reacting with intestinal antigens , and mediate immune tolerance [ 14 ] . 
It has been known that some drugs can reestablish the microenvironment of the intestinal tract , thereby enhancing mucosal as well as systemic immune response [ 15-17 ] . 
Intestinal immunity has been evaluated with respect to CD4 + cells armed with secretory intestine-derived IgA , and CD8 + cells armed with IgG [ 18 ] . 
Down-regulation of immune responses by regulatory T cells is one of the major mechanisms involved in the induction of tolerance and self - and allo-antigen [ 19 ] . 
Microflora-associated antigens + can drive antigen-specific CD4 T cells to cause intestinal inflammation . 
Therefore , the effectors CD4 + T cells seem to regulate the development of intestinal inflammation [ 4 ] . 
Our results showed that there were significant changes in CD4 + and CD8 + cells both in Peyer 's patch and peripheral blood in BSD mice , and HXZQ could regulate the proportion of CD4 + + to CD8 . 
These results further supported that dysbacteria might take some active role in immune response in BSD mice , and HXZQ might have potential regulative activities on enteric mucosal immune responses in diarrhea . 
The results also indicate + + that CD4 and CD8 T cells in Peyer 's patch may serve as one of the targets of the immunoregulatory activity of huxiangzhengqi liquid . 
TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine with strong proinflammatory , immunomodulatory properties , and plays a critical role in inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease [ 20,21 ] . 
Anti-TNF therapy has been proven to be a milestone in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease , and equally important in other inflammationmediated conditions , including viral infections and mucosal inflammation [ 22,23 ] . 
Different strategies have been explored aiming at inhibiting TNF . 
Infliximab , a chimeric antibody to TNF-α , holds much promise for the treatment of Crohn 's disease [ 24 ] . 
TNF-α levels in enteric tissue homogenates and peripheral blood in BSD mice were higher in our study , while HXZQ could decrease TNF-α . 
The results could partially explain the immunosuppressive activities of HXZQ in immune response of mice , and further support that dysbacteria could lead to increased inflammatory response in BSD mice .
