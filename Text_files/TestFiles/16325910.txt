Abstract 
The innate immune response is critical to enteric disease resistance and the induction of mucosal adaptive immunity . 
In mucosae of the small intestine , Peyer 's patches play a central role in immune surveillance and sampling of bacteria by specialized M cells . 
The innate immune response to Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis , an enteric pathogen of swine , involves IL-1 and IL-8 mRNA induction but not that of IL-6 and TNF , in contrast to Salmonella serovar Typhimurium infection of murine small intestine . 
We investigated in vivo responses to Salmonella and potential effects of animal variation since the gut environment is highly dynamic and constantly changing physiologically . 
Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis induced an early proinﬂammatory cytokine response at 6 h after infection , which was characterized by a 4-fold increase in production of CXCL2 mRNA by jejunal Peyer 's patches ( JPP ) , and a 12-fold increase in IL-1 and 4-fold increase in IL-8 ( CXCL8 ) mRNAs by distal ileal Peyer 's patches ( IPP ) . 
Levels of IL-1 and IL-8 mRNA were positively correlated with numbers of mucosal neutrophils in the distal IPP . 
Salmonella DNA was also detected in ileal tissues , including Peyer 's patches , absorptive epithelium and mesenteric lymph nodes , in 33 -- 83 % of infected animals , compared to the jejunal tissues , which were positive in 0 -- 33 % of infected pigs . 
Notwithstanding substantial animal-to-animal variation , IL-1 was increased in both proximal and distal IPP , IL-8 was increased in the distal IPP , and calprotectin was associated with both by cluster analysis . 
These data indicate that IL-1 and IL-8 expression in the IPP plays a key role early in the interaction between Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis and the small intestine .

1. Introduction
intestinal disease resistance and the induction of mucosal adaptive immunity . 
The importance of the innate immune system is underscored by the fact that it is present in all multi-cellular organisms , yet adaptive immunity has only been identiﬁed in higher order vertebrates ( Medzhitov and Janeway , 1998 ) . 
Cells , including neutrophils , macrophages , dendritic cells and epithelial cells , express pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) .

Salmonella contain several PAMPS , including lipopolysaccharide , ﬂagellin , peptidoglycan and mannose , although ﬂagellin appears to be the major molecular trigger that activates the epithelial proinﬂammatory gene program ( Zeng et al. , 2003 ) . 
Innate immune responses in jejunal Peyer 's patch to Salmonella challenge include inﬂammatory cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -1 and IL-8 , but not TNF or IL-6 ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ) . 
In contrast , in the murine small intestine , both IL-6 and TNF are induced after exposure to Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( Arnold et al. , 1993 ; Klimpel et al. , 1995 ) . 
The ability of Salmonella to cause systemic or enteric disease is likely to be inﬂuenced by the innate immune responses of the host and Salmonella-encoded virulence genes ( Kingsley and Baumler , 2000 ) . 
Salmonella enterica represents a serologically diverse group of enteric pathogens that cause disease in animals and humans . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis is a major enteric pathogen in swine , producing septicemia , enterocolitis , pneumonia and hepatitis , and is a common cause of systemic disease ( Schwartz , 1999 ) . 
Most salmonellosis outbreaks take place in juvenile , weaned pigs , with fewer outbreaks occurring in adult and suckling pigs ( Schwartz , 1999 ) . 
Ingested Salmonella invade epithelial cells of the small intestine , including those of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) . 
The organized GALT includes the Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and provides speciﬁc , acquired immune defences against bacterial pathogens ( Mowat , 2003 ) . 
Salmonella serovars Typhimurium and Choleraesuis both rapidly interact with the intestinal mucosa after they have proliferated sufﬁciently in the lumen of the intestine . 
In porcine ileal and jejunal loop models , Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and Choleraesuis adhere to the brush border of enterocytes and invade epithelial cells within 10 min of exposure . 
Both Salmonella serovars are detected within epithelial cells and in the lamina propria within 1 -- 2 h of exposure ( Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ; Schauser et al. , 2004 ) . 
Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis subsequently disseminates to the mesenteric lymph nodes draining the affected intestinal segment ( Reed et al. , 1986 ) . 
While the kinetics of Salmonella invasion is similar for serovars Typhimurium and Choleraesuis , the cellular damage they cause is different ( Bolton et al. , 1999 ; Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ) . 
Exposure to Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis induces less epithelial cell swelling and relatively higher amounts of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia formation compared to Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( Bolton et al. , 1999 ; Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ) . 
The minimal cell damage induced by Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis may allow the bacteria to more quickly enter the systemic circulation due to a reduced inﬂammatory response ( Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ) . 
In support of this hypothesis , Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis infection induced the most severe clinical symptoms and was the only serovar recovered from systemic sites , compared to Salmonella serovars Typhimurium and Dublin ( Watson et al. , 2000b ) . 
lance and antigen sampling in the small intestine . 
The follicleassociated epithelium within jejunal Peyer 's patches preferentially takes up inert particles in comparison to the neighboring absorptive epithelium ( Beier and Gebert , 1998 ; Liebler et al. , 1995 ) . 
Peyer 's patches also constitute the main portal of entry for Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( Jones et al. , 1994 ; Schauser et al. , 2004 ) . 
Thus , the acute immune response by the Peyer 's patch is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of disease . 
As the cellular complexity of the Peyer 's patch and lymph nodes can not readily be recreated in vitro , we employed an in vivo infection model . 
In addition , the ability of Salmonella to cause systemic or enteric disease is likely to be inﬂuenced by the innate immune responses of the host and Salmonella-encoded virulence genes ( Kingsley and Baumler , 2000 ) . 
Therefore , we examined the innate immune response by studying changes in cytokine levels in intact porcine GALT after in vivo exposure to intragastric Salmonella . 
We hypothesized that oral infection of pigs with Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis would induce an immediate immune response , including chemotaxis of neutrophils to the site of inﬂammation .

2. Methods
2.1. Animals
The outbred , mixed sex , weaned pigs in this study were clinically healthy . 
Pigs had continuous access to water and nonmedicated pig feed , were not fasted prior to sacriﬁce , and were under veterinary care . 
Procedures were conducted on animals anesthetized by intramuscular injection of tiletamine hydrochloride -- zolazepam ( Telazol ® ; 10 mg/kg ; Fort Dodge Laboratories , Inc. , Fort Dodge , IA ) and subsequently euthanized with intravenous Beuthanasia ® - D Special ( 0.5 ml/kg ; ScheringPlough Animal Health , Union , NJ ) in accordance with approved University of Minnesota IACUC protocols . 
Eleven 37-day-old Yorkshire pigs were obtained from a single litter . 
Animals were given one intramuscular injection of Naxcel ( Ceftiofur sodium at 2.2 mg/kg intramuscularly ) upon arrival and housed in isolation for 17 days before the experiment . 
Intestinal tissues were collected 6 h after intragastric inoculation . 
Naxcel is used for the treatment and control of swine bacterial pneumonia and is rapidly cleared from the pig by 5 days after treatment ( Beconi-Barker et al. , 1996 ) . 
Tissues were removed within 15 min of death and placed in ice-cold Kreb 's bicarbonate buffer ( composition : Krebs ' HEPES buffer ( pH 7.4 ) : 118 mM NaCl , 4.7 mM KCl , 2.5 mM CaCl , 0.5 mM MgCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1.0 mM NaH PO and 11 mM d-glucose ) . 
Intestinal segments were incised longitudinally along the mesenteric border and stripped of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers by blunt dissection . 
JPP were deﬁned as distinct PP aboral to the duodenojejunal ﬂexure . 
Ileal Peyer 's patches were excised from the continuous PP , and distal ileal Peyer 's patches were deﬁned as those located approximately 10 -- 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction .

tiss III , Washington University , St. Louis , MO ) , is a highly virulent strain and a swine ﬁeld isolate . 
Bacteria were grown statically to a density of 108 CFU/ml ( late logarithmic phase ) as described previously ( Kennedy et al. , 1999 ) . 
Anesthetized pigs were given 109 CFU of strain 3246 in 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) by intragastric catheter . 
The catheter was washed with an additional 10 ml of PBS and then removed . 
Control animals were given 20 ml PBS by the same route . 
Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis strain 3246 ( Dr. Roy Cur ¬ 
2.3. Histology and neutrophil counts
were collected from each animal , ﬁxed in 10 % buffered formalin , and embedded in parafﬁn . 
Two sections ( 6 m thick ) per sample were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined in a blinded fashion . 
The total number of neutrophils in the mucosa overlying a 5-mm length of serosa was counted , corresponding to 13 ﬁelds of view . 
Neutrophils were considered to be within the mucosa if they were luminal to the muscularis mucosa , including those in the lamina propria , in or touching the epithelium Distal ileum and jejunum , each containing Peyer 's patches , and among the lymphoid cells of the GALT . 
Neutrophils were differentiated from eosinophils by their distinct morphology , the presence of transparent to pale pink cytoplasmic granules and a segmented nucleus , whereas eosinophils contain red granules and a bi-lobate nucleus . 
2.4. Salmonella detection by PCR
Numbers of internalized Salmonella were determined by a gentamicin survival assay combined with PCR detection of the Salmonella-speciﬁc gene invA ( Elsinghorst , 1994 ; Green et al. , 2003 ; Malorny et al. , 2003 ; Rahn et al. , 1992 ) . 
A preliminary experiment indicated that direct plating of homogenized tissues was not sensitive enough to consistently detect internalized Salmonella , indicating that an enrichment step was required . 
Brieﬂy , approximately 1 g samples of tissue were washed in ice-cold PBS and incubated in a solution containing 100 g/ml gentamicin in PBS for 80 min in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 ◦ C to kill adherent , extracellular bacteria . 
The tissue was then homogenized in 10-ml sterile buffered peptone water ( BPW ) and incubated at 37 ◦ C with agitation for 16 h. Samples were pelleted at 1000 × g for 3 min to remove solid materials , and supernatants were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to pellet bacteria . 
Pellets were resuspended in PrepMan Ultra reagent ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , boiled for 10 min , and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min ( Oliveira et al. , 2003 ) . 
The supernatant was diluted 50-fold with 10 mM Tris -- HCl , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) and 1 l was added to a 15 l reaction containing SYBR Green I Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , 400 ng / l bovine serum albumin , fraction V puriﬁed ( BSA ) ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , and 100 nM of each invA primer : 5 ′ - GCCTGCCGGAACTATTGTTA-3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGACACGACTTCATCGGAAT-3 ′ . 
These invA primers amplify a 143 bp fragment of invA . 
denaturing at 95 ◦ C for 10 min and then subjected to 50 cycles of 95 ◦ C for 20 s , 60 ◦ C for 30 s and 72 ◦ C for 45 s in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . 
Results were compared by determining the cycle number ( Ct value ) at which the ﬂuorescence signal of the product passed the threshold ( 0.03 ) ( User Bulletin # 2 , Applied Biosystems ; Foster City , CA ) . 
To conﬁrm amplicon speciﬁcity , the PCR products were subjected to melting curve analysis ( Tm ) DNA samples were measured in replicate PCR reactions by 
( Schmittgen et al. , 2000 ) at 95 ◦ C for 15 s , 60 ◦ C for 20 s , then ramping from 60 to 95 ◦ C over 20 min , or were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . 
Samples were considered positive if they had a mean Ct value ≤ 45 and mean Tm within 2 S.D. of that measured in standards of Salmonella DNA , which was puriﬁed from overnight cultures of Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis 3246 and quantiﬁed by spectrophotometry . 
No template controls ( NTC ) and pig genomic DNA yielded the maximum possible Ct value ( 50 ) , indicative of no ampliﬁcation . 
2.5. RNA isolation
Tissues were stored in RNAlater ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) at − 20 ◦ C until total RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . 
RNA quality was determined by examination of the 28S/18S rRNA ratio on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer , using an RNA Nano chip ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) and RNA 6000 ladder ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) . 
High quality RNA was quantiﬁed by spectrophotometry . 
2.6. qRT-PCR
The relative expression of messenger RNA transcripts from speciﬁc genes was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . 
Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a modiﬁed Superscript II RNaseH-protocol ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) with 2 g of total RNA and random hexamer primers ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . 
Approximately 12 -- 30 ng of converted total RNA was mixed with the SYBR Green I Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , and porcine speciﬁc primers designed by Primer3 software ( Rozen and Skaletsky , 2000 ) ( Table 1 and described previously ; Hyland et al. , 2005 ; Machado et al. , 2005 ) . 
described for the Salmonella PCR , except that the reactions were denatured at 95 ◦ C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 ◦ C for 15 s and 60 ◦ C for 1 min . 
log transformed , background-subtracted relative ﬂuorescence values ( LinRegPCR program , Version 7.4 ) ( Ramakers et al. , 2003 ) . 
Relative starting template ﬂuorescence ( R0 ) was determined using the method of Peirson et al. ( 2003 ) and a mean PCR reactions were performed and products veriﬁed as PCR efﬁciencies were calculated by linear regression of the

PP-containing tissue was isolated and immediately ﬁxed in ﬁxative ( 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0.2 % picric acid in 0.16 M phosphate-buffer , pH 6.9 ) overnight at 4 ◦ C . 
The tissue was subsequently stored in a solution containing 30 % sucrose , PBS and 0.01 % sodium azide at 4 ◦ C until freezing into blocks . 
Twenty micron cryostat sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 1 % normal donkey serum , 1 % BSA , 0.3 % Triton X-100 and 0.01 % sodium azide . 
Sections were incubated with polyclonal antibodies raised in goat to structural antigens common to all Salmonella serotypes ( CSA-1 ; 1:100 dilution ; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) and antibodies raised in mouse against human calprotectin ( calprotectin ; 1:1000 ; Serotec , Raleigh , NC ) . 
Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies ( 1:100 ; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) and Cy5-conjugated donkey antimouse antibodies ( 1:400 ; Jackson ) were used to detect patterns of Salmonella and calprotectin staining , respectively . 
The slides were also co-stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the PP architecture . 
Sections were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions and xylene for 30 s each , and mounted using DPX mounting media . 
Slides were scanned using a confocal laserscanning microscope ( CLSM 1024 , Comos Biorad , Hercules , CA ) .

Ileal Peyer 's patches and absorptive epithelium from Salmonella-infected pigs were more frequently positive for Salmonella than jejunal tissues from the same pigs at 6 h after inoculation . 
Salmonella DNA was detected in two of six ( 33.3 % ) ileocecal MLN ( ic-MLN ) , but not in jejunal MLN ( j-MLN ) ( Table 2 ) .

dispersed throughout the luminal aspect of the follicle ( the dome region ) and the surrounding villi . 
Salmonella immunoreactivity was also observed in jejunal sections ( Fig. 1B ) and it appeared that more bacteria were located in the villi than the dome of the follicle ( not shown ) . 
Salmonella labeling was absent from tissues examined from control pigs ( not shown ) . 
3.2. Innate responses of the GALT to Salmonella infection
Signiﬁcantly greater numbers of neutrophils were visible in the mucosa of distal IPP from Salmonella-infected pigs compared to controls ( p < 0.05 , unpaired t-test ) . 
Neutrophils were also present in the mucosa of JPP , close to the lumen , but the numbers of neutrophils were not signiﬁcantly different from uninfected JPP at 6 h after infection ( Fig. 2 ) . 
No gross lesions or signs of edema were evident in the jejunum or ileum in any of the pigs . 
Messenger RNA expression of the inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - was measured by qRT-PCR as described previously ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ) . 
In a preliminary study , one animal per time point was inoculated intragastrically with Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis strain 3246 , from 1 to 12 h . 
The small intestine of pigs which were infected for 6 and 12 h had watery intestinal contents , yet had no external signs of diarrhea prior to euthanasia . 
In addition , at 12 h , the mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and hyperemic . 
We observed that a maximal IL-1 mRNA response was induced in JPP , proximal IPP , and distal IPP by 6 h which returned to baseline levels by 12 h. IL-8 mRNA levels were at their highest in both proximal and distal IPP by 6 h ( data not shown ) . 
Six hours was selected as the optimal time on which to focus further studies . 
In addition to IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - , expression of chemokine MIP-3 ( CCL19 ) , chemokine MIP-2 ( CXCL2 ) , lysozyme ( LYS ) and inhibitor of apoptosis ( IAP ) were measured by qRT-PCR in 6 h-inoculated animals . 
Lysozyme was selected since its transcripts are inhibited in murine Paneth cells after exposure to the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( Salzman et al. , 2003 ) . 
At 6 h , Salmonella infection signiﬁcantly increased mRNA levels of CXCL2 in the JPP , IL-1 in the proximal IPP , and both IL

1 and IL-8 in the distal IPP ( Fig. 3 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in levels of lysozyme or IAP in Salmonella-infected PP compared to control PP . 
Levels of IL-1 and IL-8 mRNA positively correlated with numbers of mucosal neutrophils enumerated in adjacent sections of distal IPP , indicating that there is a direct relationship between cytokine expression and neutrophil chemotaxis ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The decrease in IL-6 mRNA expression observed in distal IPP likely represents variation in baseline values , as IL-6 was expressed at the lowest basal levels of the cytokines examined ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ) . 
Calprotectin , a heterodimer or homodimer of subunits S100A8 and S100A9 , is expressed by myeloid cells , including neutrophils and monocytes ( Nacken et al. , 2003 ) . 
Messenger RNA levels of S100A9 subunit were similar in Salmonella-infected and control PP ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In both Salmonella-infected and control animals , calprotectin-expressing cells were visible by immunohistochemistry in the dome region and surrounding villi of the JPP , proximal IPP , and distal IPP sections ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Occasionally Salmonella immunoreactivity overlapped with calprotectin labeling ( Fig. 1B -- D ) , which was not surprising , given the small number of Salmonella present in the tissue and the small area examined by immunohistochemistry . 
It may indicate the presence of bacteria within calprotectin-positive cells , but we can not exclude the possibility that it was a chance event . 
Calprotectin subunit S100A8 mRNA was not analyzed by qRT-PCR , since insufﬁcient porcine sequence was available to design primers which speciﬁcally distinguished mRNA from genomic DNA

After Salmonella infection , levels of S100A9 , IL-1 and IL-8 mRNAs were consistently unregulated and closely correlated in both the proximal and distal IPP . 
However , differences in S100A9 mRNA levels between infected and control pigs were not statistically signiﬁcant due to variation between pigs ( Figs. 3 and 5 ) . 
The mRNA fold-change levels were clustered both by each gene and by individual pigs to determine which genes were altered in expression as a group and the extent of pig-to-pig variation , respectively . 
At one extreme , Salmonella-infected pig 59 showed an IPP gene expression pattern similar to that of uninfected pigs , indicating no response to infection ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Conversely , uninfected pig 67 had high basal mRNA levels and the clustering algorithm placed its gene expression pattern with the Salmonella-infected pigs ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In addition , S100A9 , IL-1 and IL-8 mRNA were clustered together in both proximal and distal IPP , indicating that their gene expression patterns in response to Salmonella were similar .

4. Discussion
Studies of cultured , immortalized human and murine cells have provided insight into initial events taking place during Salmonella -- host cell interactions ( McCormick , 2003 ) . 
Virulent Salmonella inject protein effectors into the cytoplasm of host cells via a type III secretion system . 
A variety of Salmonella proteins mediate bacterial invasion by inducing actin rearrangement and macropinocytosis ( Cossart , 2004 ) , as well as caspase-1-mediated cell death of macrophages and dendritic cells ( Hersh et al. , 1999 ; van der Velden et al. , 2003 ; Watson et al. , 2000a ) . 
Caspase-1 enzymatically cleaves IL-1 and IL-18 to their bioactive forms , and IL-1 additionally activates NF - B-mediated transcription of chemokines ( Lee et al. , 2004 ; Monack et al. , 2000 ) . 
Salmonella ﬂagellin is translocated to the epithelial basolateral membrane , where it binds to basolaterally expresse

TLR5 ( Gewirtz et al. , 2001a , b ) . 
Ligation of TLR5 activates NF - B and MAPK signaling pathways to induce expression of several inﬂammation-associated genes , including IL-8 and other chemokines ( Elewaut et al. , 1999 ; Gewirtz et al. , 2001a ) . 
IL-1 mRNA synthesis and protein secretion are increased in intestinal epithelial cells , macrophages , and dendritic cells after Salmonella infection ( Means et al. , 2003 ) . 
IL-1 additionally enhances the innate response program by activating NF - B and transcription of chemokines ( Calkins et al. , 2002 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
In this study , an inﬂammatory cytokine response was induced in porcine Peyer 's patch after oral infection with virulent Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis , featuring rapid increases in CXCL2 , IL-1 and IL-8 mRNA levels . 
After Salmonella serovar Typhimurium infection of bovine ileal loops , IL-1 , IL-8 , GRO ( CXCL1 ) , GRO ( CXCL3 ) and GCP2 ( CXCL6 ) transcripts were increased in expression by 3 h post infection ( Reis et al. , 2003 ; Santos et al. , 2002 ) . 
Salmonella serovar Typhimurium induced increased mRNA expression of IL-1 , IL-8 , K60 ( CXC chemokine ) and MIP-1 by chicken ileum , which does not contain PP ( Withanage et al. , 2004 ) . 
Interestingly , CXCL2 , whose expression increases in dendritic cells after exposure to Salmonella ﬂagellin ( Means et al. , 2003 ) , was signiﬁcantly increased only in JPP of infected pigs . 
Expression of inhibitor of apoptosis ( IAP ) was not signiﬁcantly altered in Salmonella-infected IPP or JPP , although it is regulated by NF - B in porcine endothelial cells ( Stehlik et al. , 1998 ) . 
IL-6 expression has been associated with tissue damage and wound healing in mice and is induced after incubation of porcine JPP in an Ussing chamber in the absence of bacteria ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ; Wang et al. , 2004 ) . 
The minimal epithelial damage caused by Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis compared to Typhimurium ( Bolton et al. , 1999 ; Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ) correlates with the lack of IL-6 mRNA induced and the absence of epithelial damage we observed histologically . 
Both IL-6 and TNF are induced after Salmonella serovar Typhimurium infection of mice ( Arnold et al. , 1993 ; Klimpel et al. , 1995 ) , yet are not altered in expression in porcine PP ( this study ) or in bovine intestine ( Santos et al. , 2002 ) . 
This study indicates that neutrophils play an important role in the innate immune response to Salmonella ( Cheminay et al. , 2004 ; Kirby et al. , 2002 ) . 
The combined secretion of IL-8 , MIP-2 ( CXCL2 ) and MIP-3 ( CCL20 ) induce neutrophil and DC chemotaxis to the site of Salmonella invasion ( Coates and McColl , 2001 ; McCormick et al. , 1993 ; Sierro et al. , 2001 ; Zhang et al. , 2003 ) . 
Release of hepoxilin A3 by Salmonella-infected epithelial cells directs neutrophil transepithelial migration into the lumen ( McCormick et al. , 1998 ; Mrsny et al. , 2004 ) . 
Neutrophils efﬁciently phagocytose and kill Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis , and subsequently release a variety of antimicrobial compounds ( Fierer , 2001 ; Zychlinsky et al. , 2003 ) . 
Since intestinal macrophages exist in a state of `` inﬂammational anergy '' , lack the LPS receptor ( CD14 ) , and do not release proinﬂammatory cytokines in response to inﬂammatory stimuli ( Smith et al. , 2001 ; Smythies et al. , 2005 ) , neutrophils may be the primary cell responsible for augmenting the initial inﬂammatory response to Salmonella . 
Here , neutrophils accumulated in the mucosa overlying IPP , but not JPP , of Salmonella-infected pigs , suggesting that neutrophils in the JPP may have already migrated across the epithelium into the lumen within 6 h . 
The direct correlation between IL-8 and IL-1 mRNA levels and numbers of neutrophils in the mucosal layer suggests a cause and effect relationship between inﬂammatory cytokine expression and neutrophil chemotaxis toward the intestinal lumen . 
with innate responses to Salmonella in that extrinsic expression of calprotectin by epithelial cells decreased adherence of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( Nisapakultorn et al. , 2001 ) . 
Interestingly , in the present study , levels of calprotectin subunit S100A9 mRNA were not dramatically altered by infection with Salmonella . 
Further , calprotectin-immunoreactive cells were present in both control and Salmonella-infected Peyer 's patches . 
These data suggest that macrophages and/or neutrophils which express calprotectin were already present in the PP follicle prior to exposure to Salmonella and had redistributed within the PP , migrating towards the lumen . 
Repartitioning of neutrophils fro Calprotectin , expressed by myeloid cells , has been associated the PP follicle to the mucosa , in close proximity to the lumen , provides a mechanism for regional changes in calprotectin levels in the absence of increases in gene expression . 
Although each experiment was conducted in animals obtained from one litter in order to minimize variation due to genetic differences , variation in both basal gene expression levels and the innate inﬂammatory response to Salmonella were observed . 
The intestinal environment is highly dynamic , and at any given location in the intestine , the microenvironment within and among individuals will vary depending on diet , intestinal contents , microﬂoral ecology , and regulation by the enteric nervous system . 
For example , bacteria may take 2 -- 4 h after exiting the stomach to reach the small intestine , depending on the presence of ﬂuids or particulate matter in the digestive tract ( Kararli , 1995 ) . 
Individual variation is an expected feature of gene expression patterns , as was noted previously in examination of siblings , unrelated individuals and populations of several species ( Cheung et al. , 2003 ; Oleksiak et al. , 2002 ) . 
In a previous study , JPP were exposed to a ﬁxed number of Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis strain 3246 for 2 h in the controlled setting of an Ussing chamber ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ) . 
Signiﬁcant variation in inducible mRNA levels was observed between JPP from the same animal , and IL-1 fold-change of mRNA had coefﬁcients of variation ( CV ) ranging from 33 to 71 % , while IL-8 had CVs from 2 to 86 % ( Hyland et al. , 2005 ) , n = 2 -- 4 PP per pig ) . 
These data indicate that the Peyer 's patch resides in a dynamic environment and that the cellular composition may differ among individual PP , increasing the plasticity of PP responses to enteric pathogens . 
is the topic of some controversy ( Hughes and Galan , 2002 ) . 
In the ligated loop model , porcine IPP and JPP interact with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in a similar time frame as serovar Choleraesuis ( Meyerholz and Stabel , 2003 ; Schauser et al. , 2004 ) . 
Data from the present study demonstrate that distal IPP undergo a greater inﬂammatory cytokine response 6 h after infection with Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis than the JPP . 
Salmonella may invade the ileum more readily than the jejunum , possibly due to physiological differences between the two sites . 
The ﬂow of digesta slows as it moves caudally from the stomach , and the sphincter muscle at the ileocecal junction delays passage of digesta through the distal ileum ( Laplace , 1981 ) , permitting increased interaction of Salmonella with the ileum and , consequently , increased invasion . 
In addition , greater concentrations of commensal bacteria are observed in distal parts of the small intestine , supporting this hypothesis ( Zoric et al. , 2002 ) . 
Typical porcine lesions are consistent with the role of the IPP as a primary site of infection . 
The characteristic , well demarcated , ﬁbrinonecrotic , `` button '' ulcers , which appear by 24 h after infection with Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis , are observed in the ileum , cecum and spiral colon , but not in the jejunum ( Reed et al. , 1986 ; Schwartz , 1999 ) .

Variation in IPP gene expression patterns after intragastric infection with Salmonella for 6 h. Expression of nine genes was quantitated by qRT-PCR and clustered by the GeneSpring ® hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient . 
Fold changes were normalized by 2-microglobin mRNA levels and expressed relative to a reference of pooled control mRNAs for each tissue . 
Dendrograms indicate the degree of relationship among expression proﬁles elicited in individual pigs . 
The relatedness of any two expression proﬁles is proportional to the length of the dendrogram branches ; the shorter the branch , the more closely related the proﬁles .
