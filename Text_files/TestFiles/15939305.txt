Abstract 
The bi-functional enzyme , adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase ( CobU ) , is involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin in Salmonella typhimurium , and , therefore , can be used for the in vitro synthesis of analogs of B12 . 
Previously , Wve diVerent steps were required to purify the recombinant enzyme from Escherichia coli . 
Here , we describe the cloning , sequencing , and expression of the cobU gene from S. typhimurium ATCC 19585 and , without introducing a puriWcation tag sequence to the N - or C-terminus of the recombinant enzyme , a new single-step puriWcation method based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography .

Cobalamin is one of the most complicated coordination compounds in nature ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This vitally important coenzyme is required by all mammals , but is synthesized exclusively by a few microorganisms . 
Although there are at least two diVerent biosynthetic pathways , one in aerobic bacteria and another in anaerobic bacteria , the assembly of the nucleotide loop in aerobes is quite similar to that in anaerobes [ 1 ] . 
In Salmonella typhimurium LT2 , four enzymes , CobU , CobS , CobT , and CobC , are responsible for these last steps in AdoCbl biosynthesis [ 2 ] . 
CobU is a 40 kDa homo-dimer protein [ 3 ] . 
Its gene has been cloned , sequenced , and over-expressed in

Escherichia coli [ 3 -- 5 ] . 
It catalyzes the formation of the activated intermediates , adenosylcobinamide-phos-phate ( AdoCbi-P ) and AdoCbi-GDP , during the course of the assembly of the nucleotide loop , as shown in Fig. 2 . 
The three-dimensional structure of this bifunctional enzyme has also been determined by X-ray crystallography [ 6 ] . 
The puriWcation of recombinant CobU , usually requiring Wve diVerent steps , has been reported previously [ 4,5 ] . 
Because the CobU protein can be used in the preparation of analogs of B12 in vitro [ 2 ] , a more eYcient puriWcation scheme is desirable . 
We now describe the cloning , sequencing , and expression of cobU , the genes encoding adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase , from Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 19585 , together with the development of a single-ste puriWcation method for the recombinant CobU protein without introducing any artiWcial tag sequence to the protein .

S. typhimurium ATCC 19585 by phenol/chloroform extraction methods [ 7 ] . 
The coding region for the ade-nosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide-phos-phate guanylyltransferase was then ampliWed by PCR using S. typhimurium genomic DNA as template . 
AmpliWcation was achieved using 30 cycles at the following temperatures : 95 °C for 0.5 min , 45 °C for 1 min , and 72 °C for 4 min . 
Finally , the reaction was maintained at 72 °C for 5 min . 
The PCR products were gel-puriWed , restricted with NdeI and PstI , and ligated with NdeI/PstI restricted pT7-18 vector . 
The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5 . 
The plasmid that carried the cobU gene in the correct orientation was designated pcobU . 
Protein expression and puriWcation
To facilitate the over-expression of the cobU gene , pcobU was used to transform Epicurian Coli-Codon Plus ( DE3 ) - RIL . 
Cultures were grown at 37 °C by inoculating a 5-ml overnight culture into 2 L LB medium containing ampicillin ( 10 mg/L ) . 
Incubation was continued until the culture reached an OD600 of between 0.6 and 0.8 , at which point expression was induced by the addition of 0.84 mM isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . 
After 4 h incubation , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 10 min . 
The cells were then stored at ¡ 20 °C . 
All puriWcation steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C . 
In a typical puriWcation , 9.6 g of cells ( wet weight ) were resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer , pH 7.0 , and ruptured by sonication . 
Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was brought to 20 % ammonium sulfate saturation by slow addition of 3.2 g solid into 30 ml supernatant . 
The protein solution was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 g for 30 min and the supernatant was applied directly to a phenyl -- Sepharose high performance hydrophobic interaction column ( 2.6 # 70 cm ) equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer , pH 7.0 , containing 1 M ( NH4 ) 2SO4 . 
After washing the column with 100 ml of the same buVer , the enzyme was eluted with a linear , descending gradient of ammonium sulfate ( 1 -- 0 M ) in 1000 ml buVer . 
The Xow rate was 1 ml/min ; 10-ml fractions were collected . 
The eluents used as follows : eluent A ( 1 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer , pH 7.0 ) and eluent B ( pure water ) . 
The following proWle was used for separation : 100-min isocratic development with 100 % A ; 700-min linear gradient from 100 % A to 100 % B ; 150-min isocratic development with 100 % B. Fractions containing CobU were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml by ultraWltration in a stirred cell Wtted with a YM-3 membrane . 
The protein solution was stored at ¡ 20 °C in the presence of 50 % glycerol . 
Results and discussions
To clone the cobU gene from S. typhimurium ATCC 19585 , a 550 bp DNA fragment was ampliWed by PCR using S. typhimurium genomic DNA as template and subcloned into pT7-18 vector . 
The DNA encoding the cobU gene was sequenced by automated methods . 
Perhaps not surprisingly , the nucleotide sequence of cobU from S. typhimurium ATCC 19585 and from S. typhimu-rium LT2 is the same . 
To facilitate the over-expression of the cobU gene , pcobU was used to transform the E. coli strain , Epicurian Coli-Codon Plus ( DE3 ) - RIL , which contains extra copies of the argU , ileY , and leuW tRNA genes , and always gives better expression than traditional E. coli BL21 strains . 
Expression of cobU was achieved by induction with IPTG . 
Inclusion bodies were not observed . 
Introduction of an artiWcial tag sequence , such as hexa-histidine , at the N - or C-terminus of recombinant proteins is a popular way to facilitate puriWcation . 
However , this might lead to the perturbation of the protein 's three-dimensional structure resulting in the decrease or loss of enzymatic activity . 
In addition , the gel matrix for this kind of aYnity chromatography is much more expensive than the gel matrix for preparative puriWcation . 
Due to these factors , no additional tag sequence was added onto the N - or C-terminus of the CobU protein . 
To purify CobU more eYciently , we developed a new puriWcation based on chromatography with a phenyl-Sepharose high performance hydrophobic interaction matrix . 
After disrupting cells by sonication and removing cell debris by centrifugation , the ionic strength of the supernatant was adjusted to 20 % ammonium sulfate saturation by slow addition of solid . 
The clariWed protein solution was then loaded directly onto a column of the hydrophobic interaction matrix equilibrated in 50 mM phosphate buVer and 1 M ( NH4 ) 2SO4 and eluted with a linear , descending gradient of ammonium sulfate . 
A broad peak containing nucleic acid and many contaminating proteins eluted Wrst , followed by some small peaks . 
CobU was eluted with pure water , almost near the end of the run . 
This step resulted in protein that was very nearly homogeneous , as shown in Fig. 3 . 
Protein yield and recovery is listed in Table 1 . 
The corrin ring itself is a very hydrophobic mole-cule . 
It is reasonable to believe that some hydrophobic patches exist on the surface of cobalamin-dependent or cobalamin-metabolizing enzymes for the speciWc binding of the cofactor . 
The use of a hydrophobic interaction gel matrix therefore has become a reliable method for purifying B12-dependent proteins [ 8 -- 10 ] . 
In fact , a recombinant fusion AdoCbl-dependent glutamate mutase has been puriWed to homogeneity from E. coli by using hydrophobic interaction gel chromatography only [ 11 ] 
According to a previous report , a hydrophobic interaction phenyl -- Sepharose CL-4B column has been used to purify recombinant CobU protein [ 4 ] . 
However , it is not eYcient enough to remove all contaminating proteins . 
The resulting proteins still need to be puriWed by dye-ligand chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography . 
How do we explain this result ? 
The main diVerence is the particle size of the gel matrix . 
The gel particle size of phenyl -- Sepharose high performance ranges from 24 to 44 m and that of phenyl -- Sepharose CL-4B from 45 to 165 m . 
The smaller the particle size , the larger the protein contact surface area . 
Phenyl -- Sepharose high performance gel matrix might therefore give a better separation . 
Thus , having successfully cloned and expressed the cobU gene in E. coli and having developed a single-step puriWcation method for recombinant CobU protein , we are now in a good position to perform large scale enzymatic in vitro syntheses of AdoCbl analogs .
