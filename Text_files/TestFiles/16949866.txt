Abstract 
Orthologs of the Salmonella BarA/SirA two-component system are required for virulence , motility , secondary metabolism and stress survival throughout the g-proteobacteria . 
BarA is a sensor kinase that responds to an unknown signal by phosphorylating the response regulator SirA . 
SirA increases the expression of genes within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) that encode a type III secretion system ( TTSS-1 ) . 
SirA does this by directly activating the hilA and hilC regulatory genes encoded within SPI1 . 
SirA also directly activates the csrB regulatory RNA gene . 
This RNA antagonizes the activity of the post-transcriptional regulatory protein CsrA that binds the mRNA of its targets to regulate SPI1 , motility and secondary metabolism . 
A second regulatory RNA , csrC , is also strongly regulated by SirA , although gel mobility shift assays do not demonstrate a direct interaction . 
Additionally , we have determined that the sirA gene is activated by crp and cya . 
The effects of crp and cya were also observed on the downstream members of the SirA regulon , hilA , sopB , csrB , and csrC . 
However , gel mobility shift experiments and DNA sequence analysis suggest that the regulation of sirA by CRP is probably indirect . 
Although SirA does not regulate csrA , this gene was also under crp/cya control . 
Supplementation of a rich medium with phosphate diminished the catabolite control of the csr portion but not the virulence portion of the SirA regulon .

of the most common serovars associated with human gastroenteritis . 
Gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella can be very severe , but is typically self-limiting . 
Human enteritis caused by this serovar is mimicked well using a bovine model ( Zhang et al. , 2003 ) . 
Typhoid fever in humans is caused by serovar Typhi . 
This disease is characterized by less diarrhea , sometimes none , but instead has a protracted systemic phase ( Zhang et al. , 2003 ; Parry et al. , 2002 ) . 
The bacteria actively invade the intestinal epithelial layer preferentially at Peyer 's patches ( Jones et al. , 1994 ; Takeuchi , 1967 ) . 
Once o the basolateral side of the epithelium , they bacteria are engulfed by macrophages where they survive , replicate , and disseminate to the mesenteric lymph nodes , spleen , and liver ( Parry et al. , 2002 ) . 
Since serovar Typhi can not successfully infect mice , human Typhoid fever is modeled using infection of BALB/c mice with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
As with the human disease , mice do not present with diarrhea , but they do get a systemic infection . 
The primary virulence factors for Salmonella are two separate type III secretion systems , TTSS-1 and TTSS-2 ( Hensel , 2000 ; Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ; Zhang et al. , 2003 ) . 
TTSS-1 is encoded by SPI1 ( Salmonella patho-genicity island 1 ) and TTSS-2 is encoded by SPI2 . 
TTSS-1 is used during the intestinal phase of disease and promotes active invasion of epithelial cells , which in the bovine model leads to gastroenteritis . 
SPI2 is activated intracellularly and is required for the systemic phase of murine typhoid ( Chan et al. , 2005 ) . 
Both SPI1 and SPI2 are horizontal acquisitions that are not present in Escherichia coli and related enteric pathogens . 
The primary question that we address in this report is how the bacterium uses ancient regulatory systems to control the expression of the recently acquired genes within SPI1 . 
SPI1 is controlled primarily by hilA ( Bajaj et al. , 1996 ) . 
This gene is located within SPI1 and encodes a member of the OmpR/ToxR family . 
However , unlike typical members of this family , HilA lacks the phosphoryl acceptor domain and appears to be a constitutive activator . 
HilA activity , therefore , appears to be modulated primarily at the level of hilA transcription ( Bajaj et al. , 1996 ) . 
Two more regulators encoded within the boundaries of SPI1 , HilD , and HilC ( also known as SirC or SprA , ( Rakeman et al. , 1999 ) ) act directly on the hilA promoter ( Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2002 ; Schech-ter and Lee , 2001 ) . 
The hilA promoter is a target site for numerous evolutionarily conserved `` housekeeping '' regulators , and is directly controlled by BarA/SirA , Hha , RtsAB , and Fis ( Baxter et al. , 2003 ; Fahlen et al. , 2001 ; Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2006 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
SirA is a major focus of this report . 
SirA is a response regulator of the FixJ family that is phosphorylated by the tri-partite histidine sensor kinase , BarA ( Nagasawa et al. , 1992 ; Pernestig et al. , 2001 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
Orthologs of sirA ( known as uvrY in E. coli , and gacA in Pseudomonas spp . ) 
are found throughout the g-proteobacteria and are required for virulence in every pathogen tested ( Ahmer et al. , 1999b ; Blumer et al. , 1999 ; Eriksson et al. , 1998 ; Hammer et al. , 2002 ; Johnston et al. , 1996 ; Rahme et al. , 1995 ; Tan , 2002 ; Heeb and Haas , 2001 ) . 
In both E. coli and Salmonella , BarA autophosphorylates in response to an unknown signal , and then trans-phosphorylates SirA ( Pernestig et al. , 2001 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
In the absence of barA , SirA can be phosphorylated from the cellular pool of low-molecular-weight phosphate donors ( Lawhon et al. , 2002 ) . 
Once phosphorylated , SirA directly binds the hilA and hilC promoters and contributes to Salmonella enteropathogenesis in a bovine model ( Ahmer et al. , 1999a ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
The existence of barA-independent route ( s ) for SirA activation in vivo has been suggested ( Chan et al. , 2005 ) . 
Other regulators affect hilA expression , but it is not known if these are direct or indirect inﬂuences . 
These regulators include CsrA , FadD , FliZ , OmpR , PhoP , PhoR , Lon , RNAse E , and HU ( Altier et al. , 2000a , b ; Bajaj et al. , 1996 ; Lucas et al. , 2000 ; Lucas and Lee , 2001 ; Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Wilson et al. , 2001 ) . 
Of these , the Csr system is a focus of this report . 
The Csr system consists of the RNA-binding protein , CsrA , and a small regulatory RNA , csrB . 
The transcription of csrB , but not of csrA , is under control of the BarA/SirA orthologs of Escherichia and Salmonella ( Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) . 
CsrA is a 61-amino-acid protein that binds the mRNA of target genes and either promotes or inhibits translation and/or message decay . 
In E. coli , CsrA is known to affect motility , exopolysaccharide synthesis ( EPS ) , glycogen production , and gluconeogenesis ( Romeo , 1998 ) . 
CsrA of Salmonella regulates motility and carbon storage as in E. coli , but it also affects genes speciﬁc to Salmonella : virulence genes located within SPI1 , SPI5 , the cbi operon required for the synthesis of vitamin B12 , the phs operon needed for thiosulfate reduction , and the pdu operon required for the vitamin B12-dependent utilization of propanediol ( Altier et al. , 2000a ; Lawhon et al. , 2003 ) . 
Which of these genes are directly regulated by CsrA is not known . 
The activity of the CsrA protein is antagonized by small regulatory RNAs . 
Up to 18 copies of the CsrA protein can bind to a single csrB RNA ( Liu and Romeo , 1997 ; Romeo , 1998 ) . 
A second regulatory RNA , csrC , that can bind up to nine CsrA molecules was recently discovered in E. coli and Salmonella . 
Like csrB , the transcription of csrC is regulated by uvrY ( sirA ) in E. coli and Salmonella ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ) . 
The csrA , csrB , and csrC genes are not physically linked , but are present within the same genomic contexts in related bacteria ( Fortune et al. , 2006 ; Romeo , 1998 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) . 
In this report we determined that the SirA regulatory cascade is under the inﬂuence of catabolite repression . 
In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes , cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) is a signal molecule that links the metabolic state of an organism to changes in gene expression ( Harman , 2001 ; Sutherland , 1972 ; Trewavas et al. , 2002 ) . 
In the Enterobacteriacea , intracellular concentrations of cAMP increase as glucose concentrations decrease ( Saier et al. , 1996 ) . 
The regulatory effects of cyclic AMP in Enterobacteriacea are mediated by th cAMP receptor protein , CRP , encoded by the crp gene ( Saier et al. , 1996 ) . 
When glucose is plentiful , intracellular cAMP levels are low , and cAMP-mediated gene regulation is thus not effected . 
Prokaryotes synthesize cAMP from ATP using adenylyl cyclase EC . 
4.6.1.1 . 
an ATP-pyrophosphosphate-lyase ( cyclizing ) that is encoded by the cya gene ( Wang et al. , 1981 ) . 
Expression of both crp and cya are autoregulated by CRP-cAMP so that when glucose concentrations decrease , the concentrations of both cAMP and CRP increase ( Fandl et al. , 1990 ; Reverchon et al. , 1997 ) . 
To activate the transcription of target genes , the CRP -- cAMP complex binds conserved ﬁve-base inverted repeats ( AAATGTGA-N6-TCACATTT ) , where it bends DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase ( de Crombrugghe et al. , 1984 ; Harman , 2001 ) . 
In Salmo-nella , Escherichia , Yersinia , Vibrio , Pantoea ( Erwinia ) , and Legionella , the cya/crp system affects genes required for survival under carbon , nitrogen and phosphate starvation , as well as virulence , motility , quorum sensing , and growth on numerous carbon sources ( Kennedy et al. , 1999 ; Kutsukake , 1997 ; Petersen and Young , 2002 ; Reverchon et al. , 1997 ; Skorupski and Taylor , 1997 ) . 
Other genera rely on cAMP signaling as well . 
However , differences exist in the mechanism of the cAMP perception and preferred carbon sources . 
In this report , we investigate the link between CRP and virulence gene regulation in Salmonella .

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and media
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Unless otherwise stated , bacteria were grown at 37 1C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth or on LB agar ( 1.2 % agar w/v , EM Science ) buffered with 0.1 M MOPS ( pH 7.0 ) . 
Xylose-lysine-desoxycholate ( XLD , Oxoid Ltd , Hampshire UK ) and MacConkey agar ( Becton Dickinson & Co , Sparks , MD ) were prepared according to the manufacturers ' instructions . 
MacConkey agar was supplemented with maltose , mannitol , and/or glycerol ( each at 0.4 % ) as needed . 
M9 minimal glucose medium was made as described ( Miller , 1972 ) . 
Kornberg medium ( 1.1 % K2HPO4 , 0.85 % KH2PO4 , 0.6 % w/v yeast extract , 1.2 % w/v agar ) with or without 1 % glucose was prepared as in Wei et al. ( 2000 ) . 
When necessary , media were supplemented with ( mg/ml ) ampicillin ( amp ) , 200 ; kana-mycin ( kan ) , 50 ; tetracycline ( tet ) , 20 ; chloramphenicol ( cam ) , 30 ; hygromycin ( hyg ) 200 ; streptomycin ( str ) 50 ; or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside ( X-gal ) 40 . 
Cyclic AMP ( cAMP , Sigma ) and [ Ethylene bis ( oxyethylenenitrilo ) ] tetraacetic acid ( EGTA , Sigma ) were added to ﬁnal concentrations of 10 mM . 
Growth conditions and reporter assays
Previously , we have shown that maximal effects of SirA are observed while cells are actively chemotaxing through motility agar ( Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ) . 
Growth on 1.2 % ( w/v ) agar plates provides moderate activity . 
Liquid broth cultures provide the lowest levels of sirA-dependent gene expression with the effects of sirA on ﬂagellar genes barely detectable ( Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
Therefore , whenever possible we use motility agar ( 0.25 % w/v agar in LB ) to assess the regulation of the reporter fusions . 
When comparing a set of strains in which one or more is non-motile , the strains are streaked on 1.2 % w/v agar plates . 
In this report , most strains were non-motile due to crp or cya mutations so most assays were performed by streaking the strains to isolation on 1.2 % agar plates . 
Unless otherwise noted , the b-galactosidase activity was scored qualitatively . 
For quantitative b-galactosidase assays , cultures were grown in shake LB cultures at 37 1C , and enzymatic assays were carried out as described by Miller ( 1972 ) using ONPG as a substrate . 
Expression of luciferase activity by reporter strains growing on agar plates or within motility agar ( MOPSbuffered LB , 0.3 % agar ) was visualized by a Hamamatsu C2400-32 intensiﬁed charge-couple device ( CCD ) camera attached to an Argus 20 image processor or quantitated in a Victor-3 multiwell luminometer ( Perkin Elmer ) . 
DNA manipulations
DNA manipulations were performed using standard techniques . 
Enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad CA ) . 
Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT Technologies ( Coralville IA ) . 
Preparation of plasmid DNA and isolation of DNA fragments from agarose gels was performed using appropriate Qiagen kits ( QIAprep spin miniprep kit and QIAquick gel extraction kit , respectively ) according to the protocols of the supplier ( Qiagen , Valencia CA ) . 
Electroporation of Salmonella was achieved using a Gene Pulser II ( Bio-Rad , Hercules CA ) . 
Unless otherwise noted , sequencing was carried out at the Ohio State University Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility . 
Strain constructions
To construct cya and crp mutants , the cya961 : : Tn10 and crp773 : : Tn10 mutations from strains TT14714 and TT14715 , respectively , were transduced with phage P22HTint into the strains of interest . 
When a strain were to have multiple mutations , the cya961 : : Tn10 or crp773 : : Tn10 were introduced last to avoid accumulation of the suppressor mutations during strai construction . 
The transductants were selected on MacConkey agar supplemented with maltose , mannitol , and glycerol ( each at 0.4 % wt/v ) , appropriate antibiotics ,

and EGTA . 
Mutants lacking cya or crp remain colorless on this medium because they are unable to ferment maltose , mannitol and glycerol ( Ailion et al. , 1993 ) . 
Th resulting strains were then conﬁrmed to have smooth lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and a lack of P22 pseudoly-sogeny on Evans Blue-Uranine plates ( Maloy et al. , 1996 ) . 
The mutants were stored at 70 1C in 25 % glycerol and used directly from this glycerol stock for experiments without subculturing to avoid the accumulation of suppressor mutations . 
To construct merodiploid csrC csrC : : lacZY reporter + strains , the csrC : : lacZY reporter plasmid pMT28 was mobilized from BW20767 into Salmonella . 
Conjugation was performed by mixing 50 ml each of a stationary phase culture of donor and recipient and plating on LB agar overnight at 37 1C . 
The following day the bacteria were scraped from the LB plate , resuspended in M9 glucose medium , and plated onto M9 glucose plates containing kanamycin . 
The fusions were conﬁrmed using PCR as previously described ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
Mutagenesis with transposon Tn10dTc [ del-25 ] ( mTn10D25 ) , one of the `` T-POP '' series of transposons ( Rappleye and Roth , 1997 ) , was performed as follows . 
A phage lysate was prepared from strain TH3923 which carries an F0 encoding a tail-less Mud phage and a second plasmid encoding the P22 `` 9 '' gene that provides a P22 tail for the Mu particles . 
When phages are induced with mitomycin C , many of the phages carry the mTn10D25 transposon . 
This phage lysate is used to deliver the transposon to S. enterica serovar Typhimur-ium strains of interest by selecting for tetracycline resistance . 
This system was a gift from Kelly Hughes and will be published elsewhere . 
The sirA4 : : hyg allele was constructed as follows . 
A plasmid encoding sirA , pBA301 ( Ahmer et al. , 1998 ) , was digested with DraII and re-ligated to remove one end of the multiple cloning site resulting in the plasmid pBA301DDraII . 
The hygromycin resistance gene ( hyg ) from pHP45 ( Blondelet-Rouault et al. , 1997 ) was removed with SmaI and ligated into pBA301DDraII that had been digested with EcoRV . 
Since there are two EcoRV sites in the center of the sirA gene this results in the replacement of 159 nucleotides of sirA with the hyg gene . 
The resulting plasmid was named pJVR21 . 
The sirA : : hyg fragment of pJVR21 was removed with XbaI and KpnI and ligated into the XbaI and KpnI sites of the suicide vector pKAS32 ( Skorupski and Taylor , 1996 ) resulting in pJVR134 . 
The pKAS32 vector has an rpsL + positive selection marker . 
Therefore , to replace the Salmonella sirA gene with the sirA4 : : hyg allele , SM10lpir/pJVR134 was mated with an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium rpsL mutant , BA715 ( Ahmer et al. , 1999a ) , selecting for hygromycin - and streptomycinresistant colonies . 
Loss of the vector was conﬁrmed by screening the resulting colonies for sensitivity to ampicillin . 
The sirA4 : : hyg allele was transduced into the wildtype S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 using P22 transduction resulting in strain JVR140 .

Plasmid constructions
The pJVR154 plasmid carries a sirA-lacZY transcriptional fusion . 
The plasmid was constructed by ligating sirA ( as a 2.1-kb PstI fragment from pBA301 ; Ahmer et al. , 1998 ) into the PstI site of pWSK129 ( pSC101 origin , kanamycin resistant , Wang and Kushner , 1991 ) . 
This plasmid was mutagenized with mTn3-lacZY as described previously ( Ahmer et al. , 1998 ) . 
Transposon insertion sites were mapped using restriction enzymes and sequenced using primer Tn3-bla ( Ahmer et al. , 1998 ) . 
pJVR154 was found to have an mTn3-lacZY insertion at nucleotide 2080 of Genbank accession number U88651 , which places the transposon within sirA toward the 50 end . 
The pMT20 plasmid carries the Salmonella crp gene including its native promoter and upstream regulatory elements ( nt 3295 -- 4223 of Genbank accession number AE008859 ) . 
This region of chromosome was ampliﬁed by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO ( Invitrogen ) resulting in pMT18 . 
The insert was then excised from pMT18 with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pWSK29 , resulting in pMT20 . 
To construct pMT28 , the region predicted to span the csrC promoter ( nt 890 -- 1225 of Genbank accession number AE008887 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . 
The resulting plasmid , pMT26 , was then digested with EcoRI , and the insert was ligated into the EcoRI site of pVIK112 ( Kalogeraki and Winans , 1997 ) . 
The plasmid pMT28 was then electroporated into BW20767 for mobilization into Salmonella . 
The csrC-luxCDABE reporter plasmids , pMT32 and pMT101 , were constructed by cloning the EcoRI fragment from pMT26 into the EcoRI site of pSB401 or pSB377 , respectively , as described previously ( Mi-chael et al. , 2001 ) . 
The resulting plasmids , pMT32 and pMT101 , carry the predicted csrC promoter upstream of a promoterless luxCDABE . 
The plasmids were con-ﬁrmed by sequencing . 
The plasmids pMT32 and pMT101 were ﬁrst electroporated into the r m + Salmonella strain JS198 before being recovered and electroporated into restriction-proﬁcient strains ( Ellermeier et al. , 2002 ) . 
The csrB-luxCDABE plasmid , pMT100 , was constructed by cloning the EcoR1 fragment of the predicted promoter region of csrB ( nt 1738 -- 1984 of a sequence with accession number AF076153 ) upstream of the promoterless luxCDABE cassette in pSB377 , as described previously ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
The cya-luxCDABE and crp-luxCDABE reporter plasmids , pRG64 and pRG65 , were constructed by amplifying the promoter regions of cya and crp ( 4145822 -- 4146619 and 3615118 -- 3615933 of the Salmo-nella LT2 genomic sequence , GenBank Accessio number AE006468 ) with PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) , and cloning these products into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . 
The inserts were removed with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI sites of pSB401 , replacing the luxRI ' fragment of this plasmid . 
Inserts were conﬁrmed by restriction digestion and PCR . 
crp/cya regulates sirA 
Protein puriﬁcation and gel mobility shift assays
Hexahistidine-tagged full-length SirA protein and truncated BarA protein , lacking the ﬁrst 198 amino acids ( BarA198 ) were puriﬁed using nickel afﬁnity chromatography as described previously ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
BarA198 was auto-phosphorylated in the presence of 1.5 mM ATP at room temperature for 15 min , and then used to trans-phosphorylate SirA for 15 min as described previously ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
The predicted promoter regions of csrB ( nucleotides 1738 -- 1984 of Genbank accession number AF076153 ) and csrC ( nucleotides 890-1225 of Genbank accession number AE008887 ) were labeled using [ g-32P ] ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) . 
DNA binding reactions using puriﬁed and phosphorylated SirA were carried out in a total volume of 20 ml containing 5 ml of 4 DNA binding buffer ( 129 mM Tris-HCl , 90 mM potassium acetate , 24 mM MgSO4 , 81 mM ammonium acetate , 3 mM DTT , 240 mM KCl , 30 % glycerol , 12 % PEG 4000 ) with 5 ml of a dilution series of His6-BarA198 / SirA-His6 trans-phosphorylation reaction mixture , 2 ml of labeled DNA fragment ( 5 ng ; 54,000 cpm ) , 2 ml of poly ( dI-dC ) ( 1 mg/ml ) , 1 ml acetylated bovine serum albumin ( Ac-BSA , 1 mg/ml ) . 
This is a slight modiﬁcation of the recipe described previously ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
DNA binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 25 min , and then samples were subjected to native PAGE with 5 % polyacrylamide gels and a buffer containing 90 mM Tris , 90 mM H3BO3 and 2 mM EDTA . 
Radioactive regions of gels were detected with a Storm PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , GE Healthcare ) and quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2 software . 
Gel mobility shift assays using CRP were performed as described previously ( Gavigan et al. , 1999 ) . 
Puriﬁed CRP protein was a generous gift of Donald Senear ( University of California , Irvine CA ) and was used at concentrations up to 1.9 mM . 
cAMP was added to 150 mM . 
DNA binding assays contained Ac-BSA ( 50 mg / ml ) and calf thymus DNA ( 2 mg/ml ) as non-speciﬁc competitors ( Gavigan et al. , 1999 ) . 
DNA binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 45 min as described previously ( Gavigan et al. , 1999 ) and resolved by non-denaturing PAGE as above . 
Results
To identify genes that affect the regulation of sirA , a transposon mutagenesis strategy was used . 
A plasmidbased sirA-lacZY fusion , pJVR154 , was constructed and electroporated into S. enterica serovar Typhimur-ium strain 14028 ( 14028/pJVR154 ) . 
This strain was mutagenized with the transposon Tn10dTc [ del-25 ] ( mTn10D25 ) and spread on plates containing the bgalactosidase substrate X-gal and appropriate antibio-tics . 
Sixty mutants with altered expression of the sirA-lacZY fusion were isolated for further analysis . 
Three of the mutants had phenotypes similar to crp or cya mutants in that they were non-motile and were unable to ferment maltose , mannitol , or glycerol on MacConkey-MMG plates . 
To test the hypothesis that cya or crp regulates sirA , we obtained well characterized cya and crp mutations ( Ailion et al. , 1993 ) and transduced them into Salmo-nella 14028/pJVR154 which carries a plasmid-borne sirA-lacZY fusion . 
The expression of sirA-lacZ was assessed on agar plates containing X-gal , because we determined earlier that effects of sirA on its target genes are much more dramatic when the bacteria are grown in motility agar ( 0.3 % agar ) , or when struck to isolation on agar plates ( Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ) . 
Expression of the sirA-lacZY was indeed decreased by the cya or crp mutations ( Fig. 1A ) . 
As would be expected of a catabolite-repressed gene , expression of the sirA-lacZY fusion was decreased by growth on LB containing 50 mM glucose ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The addition of 10 mM cAMP to the medium restored the expression of sirA-lacZY in the cya mutant , but not in the crp mutant ( Fig. 1C ) . 
This supports the hypothesis that crp and cya are required for optimal expression of sirA and that the effect of cAMP requires crp . 
crp/cya affects the virulence portion of the SirA regulon 
To determine whether cya and crp mutations have downstream consequences on the BarA/SirA cascade , we ﬁrst tested the effects of these mutations on the virulence portion of the SirA regulon . 
The virulence portion of the regulon was represented by MudJ fusions ( MudJ creates lacZY transcriptional fusions ) to the central regulatory locus of SPI1 , hilA , and to a downstream effector gene within SPI5 , sopB . 
The expression of hilA was reduced by both the crp and cya mutations ( Fig. 1D ) . 
As would be expected of a catabolite repressed gene , expression of hilA was decreased by growth on LB containing glucose ( Fig. 1E ) . 
The addition of cyclic AMP to the medium restored th expression of hilA to wild-type levels in the cya mutant but not in the crp mutant ( Fig. 1F ) . 
Similar results were obtained using the sopB : : MudJ ( not shown ) and plasmid-encoded sopB-luxCDAB fusions ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Interestingly , the effects of crp and sirA ( or cya and sirA ) were additive suggesting that crp and sirA can affect sopB independently . 
The addition of cAMP to the medium brought the sopB expression up to the sirA level in a cya sirA double mutant but not in the crp sirA double mutant . 
Therefore , crp and cya are required for optimal expression of the virulence portion of the SirA regulon . 
SirA regulates csrC
In both Salmonella and E. coli , SirA directly regulates csrB , a gene encoding a small regulatory RNA that inhibits the activity of the RNA-binding protein CsrA ( Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
However while SirA inhibits CsrA activity via the activation of csrB , SirA does not regulate the transcription of csrA ( Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
In E. coli and Salmonella , a second regulatory RNA , csrC , is also regulated by SirA ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ) . 
Using the csrC DNA sequence from E. coli , we identiﬁed an orthologous gene in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium genome ( GenBank accession #DQ328981 ) . 
This sequence is 85 % identical to the E. coli csrC , it contains similar 35 , 10 and +1 elements , several AGGA motifs typical of CsrA-binding regulatory RNAs , as well as a predicted Rho-independent terminator ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) . 
In Salmonella , the predicted csrC overlaps the sequence annotated as STM4002 ( Fig. 3 ; McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ) . 
STM4002 lies upstream of hemN , however it does not appear to code for a protein with recognized homologies in any other organism . 
We propose that this region ( nt 1188-1435 of Genbank accession number AE008887 , Fig. 3 ) be named csrC based on its sequence similarity with the corresponding E. coli gene and genomic context . 
Orthologous sequences are also pre-sent in the genomes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( STY3879 ) and Shigella ﬂexneri ( un-named sequence upstream of yihI ) . 
To study the regulation of csrC in Salmonella , the predicted promoter region upstream of csrC was cloned into the suicide reporter vector pVIK112 to create a lacZY transcriptional fusion ( Kalogeraki and Winans , 1997 ) . 
The csrC : : lacZY suicide plasmid , pMT28 , was mobilized into Salmonella where integration of the plasmid into the chromosome by homologous recombination resulted in a strain containing both a wild-type copy of csrC and a csrC : : lacZY fusion . 
Transduction of a sirA mutation into this strain dramatically reduced the expression of the csrC : : lacZY fusion ( Fig. 1G , 4A ) . 
The expression of the csrC : : lacZY fusion was similarly reduced in a DbarA background ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The sirA gene expressed from a plasmid , pBA305 , complemented the chromosomal sirA mutation with regard to csrC expression , conﬁrming that sirA controls csrC in Salmonella ( Fig. 4A ) . 
This supports the work of Fortune and colleagues that csrC is regulated by SirA in Salmonella ( Fortune et al. , 2006 ) . 
To test the hypothesis that csrC is directly regulated by SirA , in vitro gel mobility shift assays were performed as previously described for csrB ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
Puriﬁed SirA was phosphorylated in vitro by BarA198 and tested for binding to the presumptive csrC promoter . 
The csrB promoter was included as a positive control . 
Surprisingly , despite the very strong regulation seen with fusions , the csrC promoter was not directly bound by SirA in vitro ( Fig. 4B ) . 
To conﬁrm that the correct region of DNA was used in the gel shift assay , this same region was cloned in front of a promoterless luxCDABE cassette to check for sirA-dependent regulation in vivo . 
When the resulting , csrC-luxCDABE plasmids ( pMT32 and pMT101 ) , were placed into the wild-type and sirA or barA mutants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , very strong sirA - an barA-dependent regulation was observed ( Fig. 4C , data not shown for pMT101 ) . 
This observation supports the conclusion that the presumptive csrC promoter region did in fact contain the sirA-dependent csrC promoter . 
This suggests that the regulation of csrC by SirA is indirect , or that another factor , not present in the gel shift assays , is required for SirA to bind the csrC promoter . 
crp , cya affect the housekeeping portion of the SirA regulon 
Fig. 1 . 
Catabolite control of the sirA regulon . 
The expression of sirA-lacZY , hilA : : lacZ and csrC : : lacZY is strongly reduced by mutations in cya or crp ( A , D , G ) . 
Expression of the sirA , hilA , and csrC fusions is reduced by supplementation of the MOPS-buffered LB medium with 1 % glucose ( B , E , H ) . 
The addition of 10 mM cAMP restored expression of the sirA , hilA , and csrC fusions in a cya background , but not a crp background , which indicates that the effect of cAMP requires the presence of a functional cAMP receptor CRP ( C , F , I ) . 
Bacteria were streaked on MacConkey medium containing maltose , mannitol , and glycerol ( MacConkey-MMG , each carbon source at 0.4 % w/v ) . 
Acidiﬁcation of the medium leads to the formation of diffuse pink halos and indicates that bacteria can ferment at least one of the carbon sources in the medium ( J , L ) . 
Similar results were obtained when these strains were streaked on MacConkey agar supplemented with each of these carbon sources ( at 0.4 % w/v ) individually . 
Bacteria were streaked on xylose-lysine-desoxycholate ( XLD ) agar ( K , M ) . 
On these plates , black precipitate indicates thiosulfate reductase activity which is regulated by crp . 
The yellow halo around the hilA mutant is caused by b-galactosidase activity resulting from the MudJ fusion used to disrupt hilA ( K , M ) . 
There are white precipitates throughout the XLD plates that should not be confused with bacterial colonies .

The annotated sequence is deposited in GenBank , Accession #DQ328981 . 
Since crp/cya affects the expression of sirA , we tested whether crp/cya also affects the downstream csr system . 
Mutations in cya or crp were transduced into strains containing transcriptional fusions to csrA , csrB , or csrC , or into the strains carrying the csrB-luxCDABE plasmid ( pMT100 ) or csrC-luxCDABE plasmid ( pMT101 ) . 
Both the cya and crp mutations reduced the expression of the csrA : : lacZY , csrB : : lacZY , and csrC : : lacZY fusions ( Fig. 1G for csrC , data not shown for csrA and csrB ) . 
The effect of cya and crp on the csrB-luxCDABE and csrC-luxCDABE was the strongest when cultures entered into early stationary phase ( Fig. 5A , data not shown for csrC-luxCDABE ) . 
In all assays , the effect of sirA on the csrB and csrC fusions is more severe than the effect of crp or cya ( Fig. 1G , Fig. 5A ) . 
The effects of crp and sirA ( or cya and sirA ) were additive in that double mutants had a more severe reduction in expression than either single mutant . 
As would be expected of catabolite-repressed genes , expression of the csrA , csrB and csrC fusions was decreased by growth on LB containing glucose ( Fig. 1H for csrC , data not shown for csrA and csrB ) . 
Addition of cAMP to the medium at least partially restored expression of all three fusions in the cya mutants but not in the crp mutants demonstrating that the effect of cAMP requires crp ( Fig. 1I for csrC , Fig. 5B for csrB and data not shown for csrA ) . 
The crp gene expressed from a plasmid fully complemented the crp mutation with regard to csrA , csrB , and csrC expression ( data not shown ) . 
The above effects of crp/cya on the csr genes were observed on LB agar buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.1 M MOPS to minimize pH differences arising from growth on LB versus LB supplemented with glucose . 
It was previously reported that in E. coli , crp has no effect on csrA when grown on Kornberg-glucose medium ( Romeo et al. , 1993 ) . 
Therefore , we tested the ability of crp to regulate csrA , csrB and csrC in Salmonella on Kornberg-glucose medium . 
The expression was so low on these plates that it was difﬁcult to discern if cya or crp mutations were having an effect ( data not shown ) . 
We hypothesized that the effect may be more apparent if we removed glucose from the medium . 
Therefore , we tested the fusions on Kornberg agar lacking glucose 
Fig. 4 . 
Regulation of csrC by sirA and barA . 
( A ) b-Galactosidase activity resulting from a chromosomal merodiploid csrC + csrC : : lacZY strain ( black bars ) was compared over time to isogenic mutants lacking sirA ( white bars ) , or barA ( gray bars ) . 
The sirA mutant was complemented with pBA305 ( sirA , vertical hatched bars ) or the vector control ( horizontal hatched bars ) . 
Cultures + were grown in LB broth at 37 1C . 
Time points indicate hours since 1:100 subculture into fresh LB . 
( B ) SirA binds a DNA fragment containing the csrB promoter , but not the csrC promoter . 
Puriﬁed SirA was phosphorylated in vitro by its cognate kinase , BarA198 , and incubated with radiolabeled double stranded DNA fragments containing the csrB and csrC promoters as described in Materials and methods . 
Each DNA binding reaction was resolved by non-denaturing PAGE and the radioactivity detected with a PhosphorImager . 
The micromolar concentration of SirA in each reaction is indicated above each lane . 
The lanes marked by an asterisk had non-labeled promoter DNA included as a speciﬁc competitor at a 20-fold excess . 
All reactions contained non-speciﬁc competitor DNA ( 2 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) ) and protein ( 1 mg of Ac-BSA ) . 
( C ) The csrC promoter region used for gel shifts in ( B ) was cloned in front of promoterless luxCDABE genes and luminescence of the resulting fusion was visualized in the isogenic strain backgrounds described in ( A ) . 
Bacteria were grown on an LB agar plate at 37 1C . 
Relative luminescence is indicated by the pseudocolored image overlayed on the black and white image of the colonies ( red4blue ) . 
The quantitative difference between wild type and sirA mutant is approximately 6-fold . 
While the expression of the csrA , csrB , and csrC fusions was greatly increased by removing the glucose , the effects of mutations in crp or cya were negligible on this medium ( data not shown ) . 
In an attempt to determine why crp regulates the csr genes on LB but not on Kornberg , we examined the ingredients of each medium . 
Both Kornberg and LB contain yeast extract , but they differ in the presence of sodium chloride , phosphate , and tryptone ( see Materials and methods ) . 
Therefore , we altered the ingredients in LB individually to match the Kornberg medium . 
Removing sodium chloride and tryptone from LB did not affect the cya - or crp-dependent regulation of the csr genes . 
However , the addition of 1.95 % phosphate to LB mimicked the results obtained with Kornberg ( data not shown ) . 
The expression of the fusions was increased by phosphate and the effects of mutations in crp and cya became negligible ( data not shown ) . 
These experiments were repeated for the virulence portion of the SirA regulon by using hilA and sopB fusions , however a different result was obtained . 
The expression of the fusions was higher in the presence of phosphate , like the csr fusions , but unlike the csr fusions , the hilA and sopB fusions remained strongly dependent on crp and cya for expression in the presence of phosphate ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , phosphate is the ingredient in Kornberg that masks the effect of crp on the csr genes and the masking effect of phosphate probably occurs below sirA in the regulatory cascade in order to affect the csr genes but not the hilA regulon . 
SirA does not regulate crp or cya
Since crp/cya are required for sirA expression , we examined the relationship in the opposite direction by testing the hypothesis that sirA regulates crp or cya . 
Plasmid-based luxCDABE fusions to cya and crp were constructed and electroporated into wild-type and sirA mutant strains . 
The sirA mutation had no effect on cya or crp expression . 
This was true when the strains were grown on the LB agar surface , in LB broth or within LB motility agar ( Fig. 6 ) . 
This lack of cya/crp regulation by sirA is consistent with the observations that , unlike cya or crp mutants , sirA mutants have the same growth rate as the wild-type strain , are fully motile , reduce thiosulfate when grown on XLD plates , and are fermentative on MacConkey-MMG ( Fig. 1J , K , and data not shown ) . 
SirA does not autoregulate
Many regulatory systems control themselves . 
The SirA protein is phosphorylated by the histidine sensor kinase BarA and potentially via ackA and pta from the cellular pool of low-molecular-weight phosphate donors ( Lawhon et al. , 2002 ; Pernestig et al. , 2001 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
To determine if sirA , barA , and/or ackA/pta can regulate sirA expression we placed pJVR154 ( a low-copy-number plasmid encoding a sirA : : mTn3lacZY transcriptional fusion ) into wildtype , barA , sirA , D ( ackA-pta ) , barA sirA , barA D ( ackA-pta ) , sirA D ( ackA-pta ) , and sirA barA D ( ackA-pta ) backgrounds . 
The resulting strains were then grown on LB , LB + glucose , Kornberg or Kornberg + glucose plates . 
The expression of the sirA fusion was not signiﬁcantly altered by any combination of mutations under these conditions ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that sirA does not autoregulate under any condition tested 
Fig. 5 . 
Activity of the csrB-luxCDABE reporter fusion in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 wild type ( ﬁlled rhomb ) , sirA ( open square ) , cya ( open triangle ) , crp ( open rhomb ) , cya sirA double mutant ( X ) , and crp sirA ( ﬁlled square ) . 
Luminescence and OD590 of the cultures grown in MOPS-buffered LB motility agar were measured at indicated time intervals , and activity was calculated as luminescence/OD590 . 
( A ) Cultures were grown in MOPS-buffered LB motility agar . 
( B ) Cultures were grown in MOPS-buffered LB , 10 mM cAMP . 
In early stationary-phase cultures , the addition of cAMP stimulated the expression of csrB-luxCDABE in the cya , but not the crp mutants . 
In the double cya sirA mutant , the addition of cAMP partially restored expression of the csrB-luxCDABE reporter , no such effect was observed in the sirA crp double mutant . 
The assays were repeated at least twice , in triplicates . 
Averages of triplicates from a representative experiment were plotted , error bars indicate standard deviations 
Epistasis experiments were performed to determine the order in which sirA and crp affect target genes . 
First , we constructed a low-copy-number plasmid ( pSC101 origin ) that expresses the Salmonella crp gene from both its native promoter and the vector-encoded lac promo-ter . 
It was conﬁrmed that this plasmid , pMT20 , carries a functional copy of crp by its ability to complement the crp mutation in RG216 ( crp : : Tn10 ) for acid production on MacConkey-MMG plates and thiosulfate reduction on XLD plates ( Fig. 1L , M ) . 
When pMT20 was placed into triple mutant strains lacking crp , sirA , and hilA , the same result was obtained in that the plasmid complemented the ability of the triple mutant to become fermentative on MacConkey-MMG plates and to reduce thiosulfate on XLD plates ( Fig. 1L , M ) . 
The addition of the cloning vector alone did not complement any mutations ( Fig. 1L , M ) . 
Additionally , single mutants lacking sirA or hilA have no phenotype on MacConkey-MMG or XLD plates ( Fig. 1J , K ) . 
These experiments demonstrate that pMT20 expresses a functional crp and that the effects of crp on thiosulfate reduction and the fermentation of maltose , mannitol , and glycerol are independent of sirA and hilA . 
Next , we tested the hypothesis that crp and sirA regulate hilA and sopB in series as opposed to independently . 
Strains were constructed that lack both sirA and crp ( or cya ) and contain hilA or sopB transcriptional fusions . 
The expression of both hilA and sopB was strongly reduced in these double mutant backgrounds ( sirA cya or sirA crp ) ( Fig. 1D for hilA , Fig. 2 for sopB ) . 
The addition of cAMP to the medium restored hilA and sopB expression in a cya mutant ( Fig. 1F for hilA , Fig. 2 for sopB ) . 
The sopB expression was only partially complemented by cAMP in a cya sirA mutant , essentially to the sirA level ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The inability of cAMP to fully complement a cya sirA double mutant suggests that cAMP acts above sirA in the cascade or that both are required for activation of the sopB promoter . 
The expression of crp from a plasmid , pMT20 , partially restored hilA fusion expression in a crp mutant but not in a crp sirA double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
The complete failure of plasmid-encoded crp to restore hilA expression in a crp sirA double mutant strain indicates that crp acts above sirA in the regulatory cascade or that both crp and sirA are required to activate the hilA promoter independently . 
Consistent with the former hypothesis , expression of sirA from an arabinose-inducible promoter on a plasmid , pJVR4 , was able to increase hilA fusion expression in a crp mutant while a vector control was not ( data not shown ) . 
This suggests that crp is above sirA in the regulatory cascade . 
With the csr system , expression of csrB and csrC fusions in a cya mutant can be complemented by the addition of cAMP to the medium ( Fig. 1I for csrC , 5B for csrB ) . 
Only partial complementation ( essentially to the sirA level ) was observed in cya sirA double mutant strains ( Fig. 1I for csrC , Fig. 5B ) . 
Furthermore , expression of crp from pMT20 was unable to restore csrB or csrC expression in a crp sirA double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
These results suggest that crp is above sirA in the regulatory cascade or that both crp and sirA are required to activate the csrB and csrC promoters . 
Consistent with the former hypothesis , sirA expressed from a plasmid fully complements the expression of csrB and csrC in a crp sirA double mutant while a vector control does not ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that these promoters do not require both crp and sirA for activation , but instead indicates that crp is above sirA in the regulatory cascade . 
All of these results taken together indicate that crp is above sirA in the regulatory cascade leading to hilA , csrB , and csrC . 
However , DNA sequence analysis of the sirA promoter region fails to reveal any putative CRP-binding sites ( Brown and Callan , 2004 ) . 
To test the hypothesis that the CRP -- cAMP complex binds directly to the sirA promoter , we used in vitro gel mobility shift assays ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Puriﬁed CRP , when mixed with cAMP , was observed binding to the double stranded LCAP positive control ( that encodes an optimal CRP-binding site ) at concentrations of 1.9 mM -- 19 nM , but not to th double stranded LRAN , a scrambled negative control oligonucleotide . 
CRP -- cAMP bound to both overlapping fragments that encompass the sirA promoter region ( nt 1189 -- 1642 and 1609 -- 1977 of U88651 ) , however , this binding was observed only at 1.9 mM ( Fig. 7 ) . 
This is a 100-fold higher concentration of CRP than was observed binding the positive control target . 
This suggests that the regulation of sirA by CRP -- cAMP is indirect or that CRP binding to the sirA promoter region is either very weak or requires another factor that was not present in the gel shift assays .

CRP -- cAMP binding to the radioactively labeled fragments were carried out as described by Gavigan et al. ( 1999 ) . 
Each reaction contained dilutions of CRP ( 0 , 0.019 , 0.19 or 1.9 mM ) , cAMP ( 150 mM ) , and nonspeciﬁc protein competitor Ac-BSA ( 50 mg/ml ) and nonspeciﬁc DNA competitor calf thymus DNA ( 2 mg/ml ) . 
Each DNA binding reaction was resolved by non-denaturing PAGE and the radioactivity detected with a PhosphorImager . 
The micromolar concentration of CRP in each reaction is indicated above each lane . 
LCAP ( positive control ) and LRAN ( negative control ) were synthesized as described by Baker et al. ( 2001 ) . 
The region upstream of sirA was ampliﬁed by PCR as described in Materials and methods . 
The experiments were repeated three times with essentially the same results : CRP -- cAMP bound LCAP at 1.9 mM -- 19 nM of the protein , no interaction of CRP -- cAMP with LRAN was observed . 
The fragments upstream of SirA were only bound by CRP -- cAMP at 1.9 mM of the protein . 
Discussion
In the g-proteobacteria , orthologs of the BarA/SirA global regulatory system control genes involved in virulence , motility , bioﬁlm formation , and secondary metabolism . 
Many of the genes controlled by the BarA / 
SirA orthologs are not conserved throughout the g-proteobacteria and were either lost from certain lineages or horizontally acquired . 
In Salmonella these genes include TTSS-1-encoding genes which are required for enteropathogenesis . 
SirA controls these genes by directly binding and activating the hilA and hilC regulatory genes that are encoded within the horizontal acquisition , SPI1 ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
The ancient conserved functions of the SirA orthologs have only recently become apparent . 
In Pseudomonas spp. , Erwinia spp. , Escherichia and Salmonella , the orthologs of BarA / SirA have regulatory effects on rpoS and the carbon storage regulatory system csr ( rsm in Pseudomonas and Erwinia ) ( Chatterjee et al. , 2002 ; Cui et al. , 2001 ; Heeb and Haas , 2001 ; Heeb et al. , 2002 ; Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Valverde et al. , 2003 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ; Altier et al. , 2000b ) . 
SirA of Salmonella and UvrY of E. coli both control the csr system by directly binding and activating the csrB gene ( Pernestig et al. , 2001 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
This gene encodes a small regulatory RNA that antagonizes the activity of the CsrA protein ( Romeo , 1998 ) . 
The end result is that SirA has repressive effects on targets that rely on CsrA for optimal expression , including the ﬂagellar regulon ( Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ; Wei et al. , 2000 ) . 
SirA appears to be at the top of these regulatory networks . 
To determine if there are regulatory inputs above sirA , we used transposon mutagenesis to ﬁnd loci that might affect a sirA : : lacZY fusion . 
Preliminary characterization indicated that three of the mutants identiﬁed had phenotypes similar to those of crp or cya mutants . 
Well-characterized mutations in cya and crp were then used to conﬁrm that these genes do indeed affect sirA expression . 
Consistent with catabolite repression , glucose represses sirA expression . 
Addition of cAMP to a cya mutant can restore sirA expression . 
Addition of a plasmid encoding crp can restore sirA expression to a crp mutant . 
All of these results indicate that sirA is a catabolite-repressed gene . 
As expected , the genes regulated by SirA are also under catabolite control . 
The csrA gene was also found to be regulated by crp/cya , but this gene is not regulated by sirA . 
In E. coli and Salmonella a new member of the csr system , csrC , was recently identiﬁed ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ) . 
The csrC gene encodes a 245-nucleotide csrC RNA , which functions similarly to csrB by binding to the regulatory protein CsrA and antagonizing its activity . 
The csrC gene is also regulated by the E. coli sirA ortholog uvrY . 
In this report , we conﬁrmed that Salmonella also has a csrC ortholog that is regulated by sirA . 
In E. coli , it was questioned whether csrC was directly regulated by UvrY because the amount of LacZ produced in a transcription -- translation reaction with csrC-lacZ was only two-fold higher whe using S-30 extracts of wild-type E. coli compared to extracts from a uvrY mutant ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) . 
In this report , puriﬁed and phosphorylated SirA did not interact with a linear double-stranded fragment encompassing the csrC promoter . 
These two reports taken together suggest that in contrast to csrB , the regulation of csrC by SirA may be indirect . 
crp-cAMP was previously shown to control virulence in several serovars of Salmonella . 
The cya and crp mutants of Salmonella are avirulent but not signiﬁcantly impaired in their ability to attach to , invade , and persist in Peyer 's patches ( Curtiss and Kelly , 1987 ; Kennedy et al. , 1999 ; Porter et al. , 1993 ) . 
Similarly , Boichenko et al. ( 1995 ) , reported that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cya and crp mutants were avirulent , and were reduced in their ability to multiply in lymphatic tissues . 
Because cya and crp mutants of Salmonella are avirulent but remain immunogenic , they have been widely tested as live vaccine strains ( Boichenko et al. , 1995 ; Curtiss and Kelly , 1987 ) . 
Nevertheless , the genetic basis for the avirulent phenotype of these mutations has not been investigated in detail , although it is known that the spv operon is regulated by crp ( O'Byrne and Dorman , 1994 ) . 
Here we report that a subset of the effects of cya and crp on virulence is mediated by sirA . 
Consistent with the proposed regulatory hierarchy ( Fig. 8 ) , there is a signiﬁcant overlap between the regulons controlled by crp , cya , the Csr system , and BarA/SirA . 
In Salmonella BarA/SirA control genes required for virulence , motility and chemotaxis ( Ahmer et al. , 1999b ; Altier et al. , 2000b ; Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ; Johnston et al. , 1996 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) . 
CsrA also controls the same virulence , motility , and chemotaxis genes , plus genes required for propanediol ( pdu ) and ethanolamine utilization ( eut ) , synthesis of a vitamin B12 precursor ( cbi ) , and an operon involved in thiosulfate reduction ( phs ) ( Altier et al. , 2000a ; Lawhon et al. , 2003 ) . 
Maltose transport ( mal , lam ) , but not growth on maltose as a sole carbon source , was affected by a csrA mutation ( Lawhon et al. , 2003 ) . 
In our experiments , a mutation in sirA did not affect the ability of bacteria to ferment maltose . 
While BarA/SirA reduces the activity of CsrA by activating the expression of csrB and csrC , a mutation in sirA did not noticeably affect thiosulfate reduction on XLD plates ( Fig. 1K ) . 
Genes required for motility , taxis , maltose transport , thiosulfate reduction , ethanolamine and propanediol utilization are known to be under catabolite control in Salmonella ( Ailion et al. , 1993 ; Brown and Callan , 2004 ; Clark and Barrett , 1987 ; Kutsukake , 1997 ; Roof and Roth , 1992 ; Yanagihara et al. , 1999 ; Yokota and Gots , 1970 ) . 
Of these genes , ﬂhD ( a master regulator of the ﬂagellar operon ) , aer and tsr ( chemotaxis genes ) , the malB region , and the phs operon are known to bind CRP or are predicted to have CRP -- cAMP-binding sites in their regulatory regions ( Brown and Callan , 2004 ; Heinzinger et al. , 1995 ; Yanagihara et al. , 1999 ) . 
Therefore , in addition to controlling the BarA/SirA and Csr regulons , CRP -- cAMP also directly regulates some of the genes belonging to the BarA/SirA and Csr regulons . 
However , the effect of crp on hilA , sopB , csrB , and csrC requires the presence of sirA , indicating that CRP is not acting below sirA to affect these genes . 
Previously , the expression of csrA in E. coli was reported to be independent of cya and crp ( Romeo et al. , 1993 ) . 
A transcriptome analysis of the crp regulon in E. coli also showed no regulation of csrA by crp ( Gosset et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , both studies used growth medium that contained supplemental phosphate while we used LB medium buffered with 0.1 M MOPS . 
Upon further investigation , we have determined that , at least with Salmonella , the presence of phosphate does indeed prevent ( or mask ) the effect of crp/cya on csr expression . 
Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which phosphate prevents or masks this regulation . 
Interestingly , addition of phosphate to LB medium did not mask the effect of crp on the virulence genes hilA and sopB . 
To determine whether the effects of CRP -- cAMP on sirA expression are direct , two overlapping fragments spanning the entire upstream region of sirA were tested for their ability to interact with puriﬁed CRP protein in vitro . 
Both putative promoter fragments formed complexes with CRP -- cAMP when CRP was added to the reaction at 1.9 mM . 
We do not believe that this interaction is meaningful because in the same experiments , 19 nM CRP bound a positive control oligonucleotide containing the canonical CRP-binding site an did not interact with the negative control oligonucleo-tide which contains a `` scrambled '' CRP-binding site . 
This lack of sirA promoter binding is consistent with the lack of DNA sequences matching a consensus CRP-binding site in the sirA promoter ( Brown and Callan , 2004 ) . 
Based on these observations , it seems unlikely that CRP -- cAMP directly controls sirA expression . 
The ﬁndings presented in this report tie the virulence , motility and carbon storage genes under BarA/SirA control with the general metabolic state of the bacter-ium . 
Based on the results of this study , the sirA regulon is not activated while glucose is plentiful . 
The sirA gene and the genes under BarA/SirA control become activated when the intracellular levels of cAMP rise in response to the decreasing levels of preferred carbon sources . 
This ensures that SirA is available to be phosphorylated by BarA in response to an as yet unknown signal . 
Fig. 8 . 
Model of the regulatory organization of crp , sirA , and csrA . 
Cyclic AMP controls the expression of sirA and csrA in a crp-dependent manner . 
This regulation is most likely indirect . 
The crp gene also affects the genes downstream of sirA ( hilA , sopB , csrB , and csrC ) in a manner that requires sirA . 
While crp increases the expression of csrA ( this report ) , the regulatory RNAs csrB and csrC inhibit the activity of CsrA protein ( data from E. coli ; Liu and Romeo , 1997 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) . 
Solid lines indicate interactions that are known to be direct . 
Dotted lines indicate interactions that are indirect or untested .
