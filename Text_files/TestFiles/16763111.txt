Selective Silencing of Foreign DNA 
with Low GC Content by the H-NS 
Protein in Salmonella

Horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in microbial evolution . 
However , newly acquired sequences can decrease fitness unless integrated into preexisting regulatory networks . 
We found that the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein ( H-NS ) selectively silences horizontally acquired genes by targeting sequences with GC content lower than the resident genome . 
Mutations in hns are lethal in Salmonella unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in other regulatory loci . 
Thus , H-NS provides a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial defense against foreign DNA , enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of newly acquired genes . 
Characteristic GC/AT ratios of bacterial genomes may facilitate discrimination between a cell 's own DNA and foreign DNA . 
no consensus sequence has been identified , al ¬ 
- NS ( encoded by hns ) belongs to a though the few H-NS binding sites mapped to Hfamily of small abundant nucleoid - date are rich in AT . 
associated proteins of Gram-negative To determine the Salmonella genes conbacteria that have the ability to bind DNA with trolled by H-NS , construction of an hns null relatively low sequence specificity ( 1 ) . 
H-NS mutation was attempted in Salmonella enterica has been shown to act as a transcriptional re - sv . 
Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) . 
However , pressor and can multimerize into higher order hns mutant strains were found to be nonviable bridging complexes after DNA binding ( 1 , 2 ) . 
unless additional mutations were present in H-NS also affects local supercoiling , leading to either rpoS encoding the alternative sigma the suggestion that H-NS and other nucleoid factor sS ( s32 ) or phoP encoding the virulence binding proteins represent the bacterial function - gene regulator PhoP . 
These mutants could tol-al equivalent of histones or mediate the global erate an hns mutation but exhibited a reduced modulation of gene expression in response to growth rate , whereas an hns mutation in an changes in temperature or osmolarity ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . 
rpoS phoP double-mutant background dis-H-NS has higher affinity for curved DNA , and played growth similar to that of the wild type 
( fig . 
S1 ) . 
This suggests that the detrimental effect of an hns mutation is due to derepression of one or more sS - and PhoP-activated loci and might explain why hns mutations are not lethal in some laboratory strains , given that rpoS mutant alleles are commonly acquired after laboratory passage ( 5 ) . 
To enable studies of H-NS function in Salmonella , we constructed an hns mutation in S. Typhimurium carrying a sponta ¬

neous rpoS mutation that confers diminished sS activity ( 6 ) . 
Salmonella genes regulated by H-NS were identified by comparing transcript levels in hnsþ and hns -- strains by cDNA microarray analysis ( Fig. 1 and table S1 ) . 
Of 4529 open reading frames ( ORFs ) represented on the array ( 4422 from the chromosome and 107 from the virulence plasmid ) , transcript levels of 178 ORFs exhibited a reduction in abundance in the hns mutant to a level less than one-third that of the wild type , whereas 409 transcripts were more abundant in the hns mutant . 
As previously reported for Escherichia coli , many H-NS -- activated genes are involved in chemotaxis and motility ( 7 ) . 
Among genes repressed by H-NS are many known virulence loci of Sal-monella , including the Salmonella pathoge-nicity island ( SPI ) 2 , SPI-3 , and SPI-5 , most characterized virulence islets , and the plasmid spv genes . 
A large number of H-NS -- repressed genes bear the hallmarks of acquisition from a foreign source -- i.e. , they are not universally present in the genomes of closely related enteric bacteria and possess substantially reduced GC content compared with that of the resident genome ( 8 ) . 
Of 409 ORFs exhibiting repression by H-NS , only 40 ( 9.8 % ) are common to all reference genomes , whereas 265 ( 64.7 % ) are found exclusively in Salmonella ( table S1 ) . 
Most H-NS -- repressed genes have GC content that is lower than the overall genome : For ORFs in which H-NS was found to repress expression to one-third or less of the original level , the average GC content is 46.8 % , whereas the average GC content of the entire Salmonella LT2 
Microarray analysis of cDNA provides only indirect evidence that a transcription factor interacts directly with a given sequence , because many regulatory interactions are dependent on a cascade of transcription events . 
For example , the apparent activation of flagellar genes by H-NS most likely occurs by means of H-NS -- mediated repression of hdfR , a repressor of the flagellar regulators flhDC ( 1 ) . 
Salmonella genes that interact directly with H-NS were therefore determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) of in vivo cross-linked H-NS -- DNA complexes followed by microarray ( ChIP-on-chip ) analysis on either a custom ORF array or a tiled oligonucleotide array with 385,000 features ENimbleGen , Madison , WI ( 6 ) ^ . 
Of the 4438 chromosomal genes covered in the ORF array , 745 ( 16 % ) coimmunoprecipitated with H-NS . 
A notable correlation was observed between H-NS binding predicted in silico by low GC content and binding measured experimentally by ChIP ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Only 5 of 745 precipitated sequences ( 0.7 % ) were not situated within 1000 nucleotides of a chromosomal region displaying an average GC content of e49 % ( averaged over a 1000-nucleotide span ) ( Fig. 2 and table S2 ) . 
Of 615 ORFs in the annotated Salmonella genome with a GC content of G47 % , 433 ( 70.4 % ) coprecipitated with H-NS ( table S2 ) . 
The oligonucleotide array provided detailed resolution of H-NS binding sites and revealed a strong correlation between H-NS binding and regional AT content , whether or not the site was in a promoter ( fig . 
S2 ) . 
Some horizontally transferred sequences ( notably SPI-1 and SPI-4 ) in which cDNA microarray analysis demonstrated only slight transcriptional repression were found to interact directly with H-NS , suggesting either that H-NS binding is not an effective silencer at all binding sites or that conditions used during the cDNA analysis did not favor expression or silencing of these genes . 
To prospectively test whether H-NS is capable of targeting AT-rich DNA from a foreign source , a gene from Helicobacter pylori Ehp0226 , GC content 0 39.7 % ^ was recombined along with its promoter into a nonessential region of the Salmonella chromosome with a uniform average GC content of 950 % and no demonstrable interaction with H-NS ( Fig. 3A and fig . 
S3 ) . 
ChIP with quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( ChIP/Q-PCR ) revealed significant association of H-NS with hp0226 but not with the adjacent gene stm1033 ( GC content 0 52.5 % ) ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Reverse transcriptase/Q-PCR measurement of transcript levels revealed significantly higher ( 915-fold ) hp0226 expression in the hns mutant compared with that of the wild type ( Fig. 3C ) . 
We concluded that AT-rich content per se is sufficient for H-NS -- mediated silencing and that H-NS can target AT-rich sequences irrespective of chromosomal location , a finding that could be exploited to optimize the expression of foreign genes in enteric bacteria for applications in biotechnology . 
Our observations suggest a previously unrecognized role for H-NS in recognizing AT-rich sequences as foreign and preventing their expression . 
Such Bxenogeneic silencing [ would protect the cell from detrimental consequences of invading DNA . 
An association has been noted between H-NS and some horizontally transferred genes in pathogenic E. coli ( 9 -- 12 ) , bacteriophages , pathogenicity islands , and mobile genetic elements encode H-NS antagonists ( 1 , 30 ) , indicating that Bselfish [ genetic elements have evolved countermechanisms to escape H-NS -- mediated silencing . 
Further work will be required to determine whether additional mechanisms of xenogeneic silencing exist in other bacterial species .
