Abstract 
Background : Seeds of Lathyrus sativus , a legume plant , contain 3-oxalyl and 2,3-dioxalyl DAP ( O-DAP ) , neurotoxins which when consumed causes Neurolathyrism or Osteolathyrism , in humans , affecting nervous system and bone formation respectively . 
Some microorganisms viz virulent and non-virulent Salmonella typhimurium , Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonad have been shown to detoxify L-α , β-diaminopropionate ( DAP ) , the immediate precursor of O-DAP . 
Result : The gene coding for diaminopropionate ammonia lyase ( DAPAL ) which detoxifies DAP was cloned from nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 into Escherichia coli DH5α and the nucleotides sequenced ( 1212 bp ) . 
Whereas the specific enzyme activity of DAPAL obtained from recombinant E. coli PU018 was 0.346 U/mg , the specific activity of the enzyme from nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 was 0.351 U/mg . 
The DAPAL corresponding to 43 kDa protein was found both in nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 and E. coli PU018 . 
The Km value was found to be 0.740 mM and 0.680 mM for S. typhimurium PU011 and 0.741 mM and 0.683 mM for E. coli PU018 when grown in minimal medium ( MM+DAP ) and L. sativus seed extracts respectively , indicating that both of them were capable of utilizing the neurotoxins present in L. sativus seeds . 
The biomass , enzyme production and the effect of pH and temperature on DAPAL enzyme activity from both non-virulent S. typhimurium PU011 and E. coli PU018 were found to be similar . 
Conclusion : The recombinant E. coli PU018 as well as non-virulent S. typhimurium PU011 are as good as pathogenic S. typhimurium in detoxifying DAP , the immediate precursor of O-DAP present in L. sativus seeds .

Introduction
Diaminopropionic acid ( DAP ) , the immediate precursor of the neurotoxins 3-oxalyl and 2,3-dioxalyl DAP ( O-DAP ) , present in Lathyrus sativus seeds , a drought resistant legume rich in proteins causes neurolathyrism / osteolathyrism in humans when ingested regularly or in large doses ( 1 ) . 
Diamiopropionate ammonia lyase ( DAPAL ) , an enzyme belonging to the Pyridoxal-5-phosphate ( PLP ) family , catalyses the α-β-elimination reaction of both L-and D-α-β-diaminopropionate to form pyruvate and ammonia ( 2,3 ) . 
Vijayalakshmi et al. ( 1975 ) ( 2 ) and Nagasawa et al. ( 1988 ) ( 3 ) have reported the production of DAPAL by Pseudomonads and Salmonella typhi , respectively . 
In their recent publication Khan et al. ( 2003 ) ( 1 ) have reported cloning , overexpression , purification , and initial characterization of DAPAL from recombinant E. coli as well as virulent S. typhimurium . 
However , because virulent strains are hazardous , we have been able to successfully identify a nonvirulent strain of S. typhimurium PU011 capable of degrading DAP ( 4 ) . 
In order to detoxify DAP present in L. sativus seeds for safe consumption by the famine-hit rural population , either that DAPAL in affordable form in bulk is made available to the community or ready-to-use , efficient , nonpathogenic bacteria capable of producing DAPAL , which is capable of detoxifying DAP , is supplied . 
The other alternative would be perhaps to develop transgenic L. sativus plants free of O-DAP . 
The study of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of the neurotoxin is therefore important for developing biotechnological methods for reducing its level in the seeds . 
In this investigation we report the cloning of gene coding for DAPAL from a nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 into pBluescript-II ( SK - ) vector and its expression in E. coli DH5α for possible use by the age old conventional solid state fermentation technique to detoxify the toxin present in L. sativus seeds for consumption by the hungry millions starved of proteins in their diet . 
Materials and Methods
The nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 , E. coli DH5α ( endA1 , recA1 , gyrA96 , thi , hsdR17 , ( r -- , m + ) , relA1 , supE44 , λ - , ∆ ( lac-proAB ) , [ F ' , traD36 , k k proAB , lac lq ∆ ZM15 ] ) and plasmid vector BlueScript SK ( - ) were obtained from the culture collections of our Department .

Inc. . 
The protein molecular weight marker was obtained from Bangalore Genei Pvt. Ltd. , India . 
LB agar containing ( per liter of distilled water ) 10 g tryptone , 5 g yeast extract , 10 g sodium chloride , and 15 g agar ( pH 7.2 ) was used for screening of transformants . 
For screening the clones capable of producing DAPAL , minimal medium ( per 100 mL of distilled water ) containing 0.05 g of yeast extract , 500 µL of mineral salt solution , 50 mM of 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 8.0 ) and 2g of agar was prepared and sterilized at 121 °C , 15 lb pressure for 20 min . 
Thereafter , to the minimal medium at 60 °C filter sterilized DAP at 0.3 % was added . 
Cloning of Genes Coding for DAPAL
Total DNA from S. typhimurium PU011 was isolated as per the method of Kronstad et al. ( 1983 ) ( 5 ) . 
Restriction digestion , ligation and transformation were carried out following standard procedures ( 6 ) . 
The transformants were first screened on LB + ampicillin plates containing X-gal ( 2 % , final conc . 
0.4 mg/ml ) and IPTG ( 100 mM , final concentration 0.2 mg/mL ) . 
The transformants were then plated on minimal medium supplemented with DAP to check whether they are able to utilize DAP as sole source of carbon . 
Sonication and SDS-PAGE
Cell-free crude extract of S. typhimurium PU011 was prepared by sonicating the pellet resuspended in 0.5 mL extraction buffer ( 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol , 100 µM Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate ( PLP ) and 5 % glycerol ) for 10 min using Branson Sonifier 250 ( 10 min bursts at 40 % duty cycle with intermittent cooling every 2 min in order to maintain the suspension below 5 °C ) . 
The sonicate was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C , which served as the crude extract . 
Enzyme assay and protein estimation were carried out using this crude extract . 
For carrying out sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacryla-mide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) analysis ( 7 ) , the same crude extract was used . 
The DAPAL activity was measured as per the method of Vijiyalakhsmi et al. ( 2 ) . 
Protein estimation was done as per the method of Lowry et al. ( 1951 ) ( 8 ) . 
Enzyme Assay (2)
DAPAL enzyme activity was spectrophotometrically measured as per the method of Vijayalakshmi et al. ( 2 ) and described in detail by Rupesh et al. ( 4 ) . 
Determination of Biomass and Enzyme Activity (4)
An aliquot of 25 mL of culture grown in MM+DAP and L. sativus seeds ( 2 % w/v in water ) was withdrawn and , after centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min at 4 °C , the pellet was suspended in 0.5 mL of extraction buffer for sonication . 
After sonication for 10 min using Branson Sonifier 250 , the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C . 
The supernatant was used for estimation of DAPAL enzyme activity . 
Effect of pH (4)
Different buffer systems with varying pH regimes employed in our study are : Glycine-HCl buffer ( pH 3.0 ) , sodium acetate buffer ( pH 5.0 ) , Potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.0 ) , Potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 8.0 ) , Glycine-NaOH ( pH 9.0 ) , Glycine-NaOH ( pH 11.0 ) and KCl-NaOH ( pH 13.0 ) . 
The optimum pH for maximum DAPAL specific activity was determined . 
The crude enzyme extract was incubated with any of the above buffers for 30 min . 
After incubation , the crude extract was precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 80 % saturation ) . 
The precipitate thus formed was resuspended in minimal volume of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 . 
The influence of pH on DAPAL enzyme activity was measured as described elsewhere . 
Effect of Temperature (4)
Potassium phosphate buffer ( 10 mM ) pH 8.0 containing the crude enzyme extract was incubated at various temperature regimes ranging between 0 °C to 60 °C . 
After 30 min of incubation , the DAPAL activity in the crude extract was analyzed . 
PCR amplification of E. coli PU018
The size determination of the insert DNA in PU 018 recombinant clone was done by PCR amplification using T3 ( 5 ' AATTAACCCTCACTA AAGGG 3 ' ) , T7 ( 5 ' AATACGACTCACTATAG 3 ' ) primers . 
The reaction mixture employed in the PCR reaction ( 20 µL ) contained the following : Template DNA , 200ng , Taq DNA polymerase 1.0 U , dNTPs 2 mM , forward primers 50 pmol , reverse primers 50 pmol , MgCl 2.5 mM . 
PCR assays were 2 performed with a Mastercycler ® ( Eppendorf ) using T3 , T7 primers with initial 5 min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of amplification consisting of 1 min denaturation at 94 °C , 1 min annealing at 50 °C and 1 min of extension at 72 °C . 
After 30 cycles , a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C was done . 
After completion of PCR , the product was run on 1.5 % agarose gel . 
DNA Sequence Analysis
PCR products were sequenced with Automated DNA sequencer employing T3 and T7 primers . 
From the nucleotide sequence , amino acid sequence was deduced using Gene Tool Lite version 1.0 ( Advanced Bioinformatics Solution , Biotools Inc. ) package . 
The complete nucleotide sequence of the DAPAL gene of nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 has been submitted to GeneBank and given accession no . 
AY651169 . 
Also , the open reading frame ( ORF ) and motifs in the nucleotide sequence of PU 018 were analyzed using the same program . 
Multiple sequence alignment of the nucleotide and amino acids was carried out using the CLUSTAL X program ( 9 ) and BioEdit sequence alignment editor program ( 10 ) . 
The multiple sequence alignment program Clustal X was used to align the DAPAL sequence of PU 018 with the sequences of all other species containing the DAPAL retrieved from the NCBI site ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) The aligned sequences were then manually checked for gaps . 
Further , the original sequence data set was resampled 1000 times and subjected to bootstrap analysis to obtain the confidence values . 
The multiple distance matrices thus obtained were used to construct trees using the maximum-likelihood , neighbor-joining method ( 11,12 ) as compiled in the Phylogeny Inference Package ( PHYLIP package , version 3.5 , Tree view [ 13 ] ) . 
Results
Cloning of DAPAL Gene
A genomic library was constructed using chromosomal DNA from nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 into the plasmid pBlueScript-II ( SK - ) vector and the library was screened for identifying clone ( s ) that contains the gene coding for DAPAL enzyme . 
Out of a battery of transformants , the clone , E. coli PU018 , that grew well similar to that of wild type non-virulent S. typhimurium PU011 on minimal medium containing DAP , vis-à-vis capable of producing DAPAL was chosen for further studies . 
This clone on PCR amplification was found to contain an approx 1.2-kb DNA fragment corresponding to DAPAL gene ( data not shown ) . 
In contrast , E. coli DH5α when subjected to PCR amplification for the presence of DAPAL gene proved negative . 
Protein Profile
A protein band corresponding to 43 kDa was observed in wild-type nonvirulent S. typhimurium PU011 ( Fig. 1B ) and E.coli PU018 ( Fig. 1C ) but not in wild-type E. coli DH5α ( Fig. 1D ) . 
Enzyme Activity in Crude Extracts
Enzyme activities in the crude extracts of wild type S. typhimurium PU011 , recombinant E. coli PU018 and E.coli DH5α are shown in Table 1 . 
The specific activity of the enzyme in all the above categories of bacteria excepting E.coli was near similar . 
Biomass and Enzyme Production

Recombinant Escherichia coli PU018 contains 1.215 kb of insert DNA from Salmonella typhimurium PU011 coding for DAPAL . 
E. coli DH5α served as the recipient to clone DAPAL gene from S. typhimurium PU011 . 
The values are mean of 3 replicates . 
increase in biomass and specific activity of enzyme with increase in incubation period was observed , the maximum reaching at 16 h postinoculation . 
Kinetic Properties of DAPAL
The Km value for the substrate , DL-DAP , based on the Line weaver Burk plot ( Fig. 3 ) was found to be 0.740 mM , 0.680 mMand 0.741 mM , 0.683 mM for S. typhimurium PU011 and E. coli PU018 , respectively when grown on MM+DAP or L. sativus seed extracts . 
The percent relative activity of DAPAL from S. typhimurium PU011 and E. coli PU018 at various pH regimes has revealed ( Fig. 4 ) that the enzyme from both the bacteria had a sharp pH optimum of 8.0 in phosphate buffer and any pH less than 6.0 or more than 11.0 has resulted in drastic reduction in enzyme activity . 
With regard to temperature optima for the DAPAL synthesized by S. typhimurium PU011 and E. coli PU018 , the enzyme retained 100 % activity up to 45 °C ( Fig. 5 ) ; however , for every 5 °C increment thereafter , a decrease in enzyme activity was evident with minimal activity at 60 °C .

Discussion
Recently , Khan et al. ( 1 ) have reported the cloning , sequencing , and partial characterization of DAPAL from virulent S. typhimurium and E. coli . 
We have reported earlier ( 4 ) on the production of DAPAL by a nonvirulent strain S. typhimurium PU011 utilizing DAP as substrate . 
However , the question that remains is whether there exists a difference in the genetic sequences that code for DAPAL enzyme in the virulent and nonvirulent strains of S. typhimurium . 
Therefore , an attempt was made to sequence the gene coding for DAPAL in the nonvirulent strain of S. typhimurium PU011 to find out the degeneracy of the code , if any , and the degree of homology in the nucleotide / amino acid sequence in the DAPAL coding gene so as to determine the conserved regions on the DNA . 
Based on our earlier ( 4 ) as well as present studies , it is evident that the 1.2-kb long insert DNA in E. coli PU018 codes for a 43-kDa protein ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Vijayalakshmi et al. ( 2 ) , Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) , and Khan et al. ( 1 ) have shown the presence of the 43-kDa protein corresponding to DAP ammonia lyase in Pseudomonas sp . 
With regard to DAPAL enzyme activity , Vijayalakshmi et al. ( 2 ) have shown a specific activity of 0.10 U/mg in the crude extract of the enzyme in Pseudomonads . 
Whereas Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) have reported the catalysis of α-β elimination of L-DAP to pyruvate at the rate of 46.9 µmol / min/mg of proteins at 30 °C from S. typhimurium , Uo et al. ( 2002 ) ( 14 ) reported a specific activity of 0.56 U/mg in the crude extract obtained from their recombinant E. coli . 
Khan et al. ( 1 ) reported that the specific activity of purified eDAPAL was 84 ± 20 U/mg and the yield was 30 -- 50 mg/500 mL culture . 
However , the specific activity of DAPAL obtained from S. typhimurium was 190 ± 20 U/mg and the yield was 40 -- 50 mg/500 mL of culture . 
In our studies the specific activity of the enzyme in PU 018 was 0.35 U/mg of protein . 
Vijayalakshmi et al. ( 2 ) and Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) have identified Pseudomonad and S. typhimurium respectively capable of producing DAPAL that degrades the precursor of neurotoxin present in L. sativus seeds . 
Interestingly , in our work a direct correlation between biomass yield and enzyme activity up to 20 h post inoculation was observed . 
Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) have also observed a similar pattern of growth and enzyme activity in S. typhimurium . 
Vijiyalakhsmi et al. ( 2 ) and Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) have reported Km values at 0.267 mM and 0.12 mM for DAPAL enzyme obtained from Pseudomonad and S. typhimurium respectively . 
In our studies , the km value for DAPAL produced by E. coli PU018 was 0.741 mM . 
The differences in Km values could be attributed to D or L or DL forms of DAP used as substrate in the estimation of enzyme activity . 
Our observations , wherein , maximum 
DAPAL activity was observed at pH 8.0 is in correspondence with the results of Vijiyalakhsmi et al. ( 2 ) who have also observed maximum DAPAL activity at pH 8.0 produced by Pseudomonas . 
Uo et al. ( 14 ) from their studies have reported that DAPAL had maximum activity with both D - and L-DAP as substrate at pH 8.0 . 
The loss in DAPAL activity with increase in temperature beyond 45 °C observed in our studies is the same as that reported earlier for the Salmonella sp . 
by Nagasawa et al. ( 3 ) . 
The nucleotide sequence of DAPAL gene of E. coli PU018 revealed an ORF of 1212 nucleotides ( Fig. 6 ) , which encoded a peptide of 404 amino acids . 
The fact that this open reading frame was in correspondence with the 404 amino acids deduced from the sequenced DNA indicates that the 1212-bp-long region could be the only functional domain . 
In reverse frame ( 3 ' -- 5 ' ) as expected no other functional domain was seen . 
A high degree of amino acid sequence conservation was revealed when the DAPAL of E.coli PU018 was aligned with several bacterial DAPAL amino acids by means of CLUSTALX multiple alignment program . 
DAPAL from E. coli PU018 was 55 % identical in sequence to the N-terminal domain of L-threonine dehydratase . 
Uo et al. ( 14 ) have reported that their recombinant clone showed only 20 % identity in sequence to the N-terminal domain of L-threonine dehydratase . 
However , Khan et al. ( 1 ) in their clone showed 51 % similarity with threonine dehydratase . 
The results presented in our study clearly indicate that the enzyme DAPAL produced by the recombinant E. coli PU018 behaves similar in all respects to that of the enzyme produced by the nonvirulent S. typhiumurium PU011 thus holding much promise for applicative purposes . 
This discovery can be considered as a hallmark , because all the earlier studies with regard to DAPAL production involved virulent S. typhiumurium restricting its use in the community . 
Conclusion
The results presented in our study clearly indicate that the coding sequences of the DNA from non-virulent S. typhiumurium PU011 for production of DAPAL are the same as that in virulent S. typhiumurium thus offering broader scope and great potential for community level applications under field conditions for detoxifying DAP , the immediate precursor of O-DAP present in L. sativus seeds .
