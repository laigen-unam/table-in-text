U
nlike CD8 T cells , CD4 T cells have been shown to depend on survival signals received in secondary lymphoid tissues ( 1 ) . 
Both common - chain ( c ) 3 cytokines ( 2 ) and TNF members have been implicated in both the generation and maintenance of memory CD4 T cells ( 3 ) . 
With regard to the cellular provision of these maintenance signals , we have been particularly interested in an accessory cell population that constitutively expresses high levels of a number of TNF ligands , including those for OX40 ( TNFRSF4 ; CD134 ) and CD30 ( TNFRSF8 ) , which are expressed on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells . 
These cells are found throughout the T zone and B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues associated with B and T zone stromal cells ( 4 , 5 ) . 
We have termed these cells adult lymphoid tissue inducer cells ( LTI ) , because of the close genotypic and phenotypic resemblance to LTI present in neonatal rodent life that orchestrate lymph node ( LN ) development ( 4 , 6 -- 9 ) . 
Following exposure to Ag , primed CD4 T cells associate with LTI and in the absence of OX40 and CD30 on CD4 T cells , T cell-dependent memory Ab responses , a hallmark of mammalian adaptive immunity , fail to develop ( 4 , 10 ) . 
We have published evidence that LTI and the c cytokine IL-7 act in concert to promote CD4 memory ( 11 ) ; namely , that IL-7 produced by the stromal cells to which LTI are attached up-regulate OX40 on CD4 CD62Llow T cells ( 10 ) , which then facilitates OX40/CD30-signals from LTI .

In this article , we report studies on the dependence of CD4 Th1 T cells on OX40 and CD30 signals . 
Double knockout mice ( DKO ) deﬁcient in both OX40 and CD30 and wild-type ( WT ) mice were infected with an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) ( 12 ) . 
Control of bacterial replication inside macrophages during primary infection is independent of Ab ( 13 -- 16 ) , but does depend on CD4 Th1 T cells ( 17 , 18 ) . 
We report here that , unlike mice deﬁcient in either OX40 or CD30 alone , DKO mice fail to control S. typhimurium infection . 
This is not because DKO CD4 T cells fail to differentiate to Th1 cells as we have found in vitro ( 10 ) , but because of a failure to sustain activated DKO CD4 CD62Llow T cells . 
This defective CD4 Th1 survival was conﬁrmed by an impaired ability of splenocytes from DKO but not WT mice infected with S. typhimurium to control infection following transfer into Rag1-deﬁcient recipients . 
Taken together , these data suggest that DKO mice have fundamental defects in sustaining both CD4 T cell help for Ab responses ( 10 ) and CD4 Th1 responses . 
Also these defects are associated with greatly reduced survival of CD4 CD62Llow T cells . 
In addition to demonstrating impaired survival of Ag-primed T cells , we found that the survival of the CD4 T cells that downregulate CD62L following transfer into lymphopenic hosts also depends on OX40 and CD30 signals . 
Furthermore , the depletion of DKO CD4 T cells was virtually complete when there was concurrent S. typhimurium infection . 
Our data suggest a mechanism whereby infections like Salmonella could exacerbate CD4 T cell depletion in HIV infection . 
Materials and Methods
Mice, bacteria, and immunization protocols
The sources and primary reference to each strain of WT , Rag1-deﬁcient , CD154 ( CD40L ) - deﬁcient , OX40-deﬁcient , CD30-deﬁcient , DKO , and B cell-deﬁcient mice are given in Refs . 
4 , 10 , 13 , and 19 . 
Mice were bred and maintained and experiments performed and approved in accordance with Home Ofﬁce guidelines at the University of Birmingham , Biomedical Services Unit . 
Mice were age and sex matched and used between the ages of 6 and 12 wk . 
Mice were immunized by i.p. injection with 105 live attenuated S. typhimurium strain SL3261 ( 12 ) in sterile PBS ( 200 l/mouse ) . 
S. typhi-murium was prepared by taking bacteria in log phase and washing twice in PBS as described before ( 20 ) . 
At the indicated time points , individual spleens were taken , weighed , and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . 
Spleens were also assessed for the level of bacterial load by plating out spleen homogenates and counting the numbers of colonies as described previously ( 13 ) . 
Critical Synergy of CD30 and OX40 Signals in CD4 T Cell onella1 
Homeostasis and Th1 Immunity to Salm

CD30 and OX40 ( CD134 ) are members of the TNFR superfamily expressed on activated CD4 T cells , and mice deﬁcient in both these molecules harbor a striking defect in the capacity to mount CD4 T cell-dependent memory Ab responses . 
This article shows that these mice also fail to control Salmonella infection because both CD30 and OX40 signals are required for the survival but not commitment of CD4 Th1 cells . 
These signals are also needed for the survival of CD4 T cells activated in a lymphopenic environment . 
Finally , Salmonella and lymphopenia are shown to act synergistically in selectively depleting CD4 T cells deﬁcient in OX40 and CD30 . 
Collectively these ﬁndings identify a novel mechanism by which Th1 responses are sustained .

Cell suspensions for ﬂow cytometry analysis were prepared as described previously ( 4 ) . 
Splenocytes were then stained with the following Abs purchased from BD Biosciences : CD62L-PE , CD4-allophycocyanin , and CD45.1-FITC and CD3 conjugated to biotin in conjunction with strepta-vidin-PE-Cy5 . 
The percentage of CD4 T cells and CD62Llow/high CD4 T cells per spleen was assessed . 
For intracellular cytokine staining , splenocytes were restimulated for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of GolgiStop ( as per the manufacturer 's protocol ; BD Pharmingen ) on plates coated with 5 g/ml anti-CD3 Ab . 
After restimulation , cells were surface stained with anti-CD3 FITC , CD62L PE , and CD4 PE-Cy5 .5 ( eBioscience ) , then ﬁxed and permeabilized with Cytoﬁx / CytoPerm Plus ( BD Pharmingen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
The intracellular cytokine staining was performed by staining the cells with IFN - - allophycocyanin ( BD Pharmingen ) .

Results Mice deﬁcient in CD30 and OX40 fail to control
S. typhimurium infection WT and DKO mice were infected i.p. with 105 live attenuated S. typhimurium . 
During the ﬁrst week , control of infection , which depends on the innate system ( 23 , 24 ) , was comparable between DKO and WT mice , spleens of which contained equivalent numbers of bacteria and developed comparable degrees of splenomeg-aly ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) . 
In contrast by day 21 of infection , when compared with WT mice , DKO bacterial numbers were 3-fold higher ( p 0.05 ) and , by day 38 , there was a 10-fold difference ( Fig. 1 A ; p 0.01 ) . 
Both CD30 and OX40 signals contributed to disease susceptibility , because mice deﬁcient in either CD30 or OX40 alone exhibited no defect in bacterial clearance compared with WT mice and were signiﬁcantly more competent than DKO mice ( CD30 , p 0.05 ; OX40 , p 0.001 ; Fig. 1C ) . 
The defect in clearance was not because of impaired Ab production ( 10 ) as neither B cell-deﬁcient ( IgH / ) nor CD154-de-ﬁcient mice , which do not develop germinal centers and have impaired T-dependent Ig class switching , infected in the same experiment cleared infection comparably to WT mice ( Fig. 1C and reported previously ( 13 ) ) . 
This indicates that there is a T cell defect in DKO mice that impairs their ability to resolve S. typhimurium infection independent of any effects on Ab production . 
Following infection DKO mice have reduced CD4 T cell numbers associated with a selective reduction in CD4 low CD62L T cells In noninfected WT and DKO mice , the proportions of CD4 T cells in the spleen are similar ( Fig. 2 , A , top left panel ) , with a ratio of CD62Lhigh ( naive phenotype ) : CD62Llow ( activated/memory ) of 5 -- 10/1 ( Fig. 2 , A , top right panel ) . 
Following infection with S. typhimurium in WT mice , there is a reversal in the CD4 CD62Lhigh/low ratio as has been reported by others ( Fig. 2A and Ref . 
25 ) . 
In contrast , in DKO mice the proportion of DKO CD4 T cells is reduced at days 18 and 38 ( but not day 0 or day 49 ) and the change in the ratio of DKO CD4 CD62Lhigh/low cells is less marked ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The changes seen in the proportions of the DKO CD4 T cell populations were due to selective loss of CD62Llow cells at all time points postinfection ( p 0.05 ) , whereas the proportions of CD62Lhigh cells remained similar to WT mice ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Both OX40 and CD30 contributed to the defect in CD4 CD62Llow cells as the proportions of this population on day 49 of infection were not lower in mice singly deﬁcient in either OX40 or CD30 ( Fig. 2B ) . 
To determine whether the defect in DKO CD4 CD62Llow T cells was due to a failure of cells to trafﬁc normally to the spleen T cell populations in the liver , blood , and mesenteric LN were assessed 
18 days after infection . 
In each case , the proportion of CD4 CD62Llow T cells was reduced in DKO mice compared with WT mice ( Fig. 2C ) , indicating that there was a widespread loss of these cells from other sites . 
The reduced numbers of DKO CD4 CD62Llow cells in S. typhimurium infection express normal levels of T-bet and IFN - mRNA The above data indicate there is selective loss of CD4 CD62Llow cells in DKO mice . 
Protection against S. typhimurium is dependent upon CD4 Th1 polarization mediated by the transcription factor T-bet ( 18 , 26 ) and 95 % of the mRNA signal for T-bet is found in CD4 CD62Llow T cells ( A. F. Cunningham , unpublished observations ) . 
To investigate whether CD4 Th1 polarization was normal in DKO mice , we FACS-sorted CD4 CD3 CD62Llow cells from infected DKO and WT mice 18 and 49 days after infection , time points when CD4 Th1 development is necessary to control infection ( Fig. 1A and Ref . 
18 ) . 
mRNA from puriﬁed cells was quantiﬁed for expression of T-bet and the key Th1 effector molecule IFN - . 
After correction for the control housekeeping gene - actin , expression of T-bet in WT and DKO CD4 CD62Llow cells was shown to be similar on day 18 , but slightly reduced on day 49 ( Fig. 3A ; p 0.05 ) . 
IFN - expression levels in the DKO CD4 CD62Llow cells were slightly greater on day 18 and comparable on day 49 ( Fig. 3A ) . 
When the different proportions of CD4 CD62Llow cells were taken into account , the total amount of both T-bet and IFN - mRNA contributed by CD4 CD62Llow T cells in the spleen was signiﬁcantly reduced ( Fig. 3 B ; p 0.05 ) . 
The difference in total IFN - production by WT and DKO CD4 CD62Llow T cell populations was conﬁrmed by intracellular FACS staining for IFN - protein ( Fig. 3C ; p 0.01 ) . 
These data indicate that DKO mice have no intrinsic defect in their capacity to upregulate the Th1 transcriptional regulator T-bet nor do they have impaired capacity to switch on expression of IFN - , but that defective clearance of bacteria in DKO mice is due to the failure to sustain CD4 CD62Llow Th1 cells . 
CD4 lymphocytes from S. typhimurium primed DKO donors fail to persist after transfer into Rag1-deﬁcient mice and fail to control S. typhimurium infection To test directly whether DKO splenocytes were defective in their capacity to protect against infection , we transferred splenocytes from DKO and WT animals , primed 38 days previously , into Rag1-deﬁcient mice . 
Control experiments and previous data showed that at 24 h CD4 posttransfer DKO splenocytes could traf-ﬁc to the spleen and proliferate normally ( data not shown and Ref . 
10 ) . 
At this 24-h point , chimeras were infected with 105 S. typhi-murium ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Mice were sacriﬁced after 7 days and the numbers of bacteria/spleen calculated . 
Rag1-deﬁcient mice that received DKO splenocytes demonstrated an impaired capacity to control the S. typhimurium infection ( 12-fold higher bacterial cell numbers ) than mice that received WT splenocytes . 
Nevertheless , some degree of protection , compared with nonreconstituted Rag1-deﬁcient mice , was observed ( Fig. 4A ; p 0.05 for all ) . 
Although the total numbers of CD4 T cells transferred were similar ( Fig. 4B ) , the proportion of DKO CD4 T cells detected was far lower than that of WT cells , even though spleen weights for Rag1-deﬁcient recipient mice were similar after infection ( data not shown ; median proportions : WT 3.9 % vs DKO 0.3 % ) ( Fig. 4B ; p 0.05 ) .

Cotransfer of WT and DKO primed T cells reveals a deﬁcit in all DKO CD4 T cell subsets that is potently exacerbated by S. typhimurium coinfection Following transfer into a lymphocyte-deﬁcient environment where the host can not contribute to the lymphocyte pool such as that found in Rag1-deﬁcient mice , CD4 T cells undergo limited ho-meostatic expansion that depends on peptide-MHC interactions ( 27 ) . 
To dissect the relative contribution of OX40 and CD30 to the survival of CD4 T cells in lymphopenic conditions ( Rag1-deﬁcient mice ) , we ﬁrst cotransferred mixtures of CD45 .1 allotype-marked WT splenocytes with CD45 .2 KO splenocytes from noninfected donors adjusted so that the ratio of CD4 T cells was 1:1 ( Fig. 5A , left panel ) . 
By day 7 , numbers of DKO CD4 T cells had fallen 15-fold lower than those of WT mice , but CD4 T cell numbers remained stable after this ( Fig. 5A , top right panel , and B ) . 
The survival of OX40 - or CD30-deﬁcient CD4 T cells showed a similar overall pattern of impaired survival to DKO CD4 T cells , but the differences though signiﬁcant ( p 0.05 ) were relatively small . 
When CD4 subsets were analyzed ( Fig. 5C ) , the major impact of OX40 and CD30 was on CD4 CD62Llow survival with a more modest effect on CD62Lhigh survival . 
The experiment was then repeated using splenocytes from DKO and WT donors infected 38 days previously with S typhimurium . 
CD4 T cell numbers were again adjusted so that the input ratio was 1:1 . 
Twenty-four hours posttransfer , reconstituted Rag1-deﬁcient mice were infected with 105 S. typhimurium . 
In contrast to uninfected mice , the impact of S. typhimurium infection on DKO CD4 T cell survival was dramatic : DKO T cells were virtually eliminated by 3 wk postinfection ( Fig. 5A , bottom right panel , and B ) . 
Analysis at day 14 , when small numbers of CD4 T cells still persisted , revealed that both DKO CD4 subsets were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with uninfected DKO controls ( CD4 CD62Lhigh WT : DKO 47:1 ; CD4 CD62Llow WT : DKO 320:1 ; p 0.05 ) . 
This result emphasizes that lymphopenia and S. typhimurium act synergistically to promote depletion of DKO CD4 T cells .

Discussion
CD4 CXCR4 expressing LTI also express OX40L and CD30L constitutively and interact with primed CD4 T cells . 
Thus , they are clearly well placed to provide these signals to CD4 T cells which up-regulate the receptors for these proteins in response to Ag activation and to the c cytokine IL-7 . 
CD30 and OX40 signals do not seem to be required for proliferation , because CD4 T cells from 
DKO mice proliferate normally in response to Ag-speciﬁc activation ( 10 ) . 
However , they are important for CD4 T cell survival : we have reported that CD4 memory for Ab responses fails in vivo if both CD30 and OX40 are absent ( 4 , 10 ) . 
These data are consistent with the idea that the CD4-LTI interaction promotes CD4 T cell survival of Ag-activated cells . 
In this study , we report that CD4 Th1-dependent control of S. typhimurium infection also depends on both OX40 and CD30 signals . 
We have published a report ( 10 ) showing that commitment to protective CD4 Th1 differentiation in vitro is not affected by the absence of CD30 and OX40 , but in the current study we ﬁnd that both signals were required for their survival . 
L-selectin ( CD62L ) down-regulation has been used as a marker for CD4 T cells activated by Ag . 
Consistent with a global defect in survival of primed CD4 T cells , we found profound depletion of CD4 CD62Llow but not CD4 CD62Lhigh cells in DKO mice infected with S. typhimurium . 
CD62L down-regulation also occurs when CD4 T cells are activated by peptide-MHC interactions in lymphopenic hosts ( reviewed in Ref . 
27 ) . 
Compared with WT CD4 T cells , DKO cells survived poorly ( 15-fold reduction ) when transferred into Rag1-deﬁcient mice , although their numbers stabilized 1 wk posttransfer . 
Loss of both OX40 and CD30 signals contributed to this reduction in survival rates . 
The very striking ﬁnding , however , was the synergy between S. typhimurium infection and lymphopenia , as virtually all DKO CD4 T cells perished under these conditions . 
Are these observations relevant to human disease ? 
Because mu-rine adult LTI coexpress CD4 and CXCR4 , ligands for CXCR4 tropic strains of HIV , we have speculated that their human equivalent could be targeted and depleted , rendering individuals effectively deﬁcient in CD30 and OX40-mediated CD4 T cell survival signals . 
This would explain the initial loss of memory CD4 T cells not infected by virus , but would also offer an explanation for the depletion of naive CD4 T cells activated under conditions of lymphopenia ( 27 ) . 
Since in intact DKO , but not lymphopenic DKO Rag1-deﬁcient chimeras CD4CD62Lhigh and CD4CD62Llow T cells were detectable throughout the infection , it implies that CD4 T cells are likely to be consistently recruited into the response against S. typhimurium . 
With regard to Salmonella infection , recurrent disease commonly occurs in lymphopenic HIV-infected individuals in subSaharan Africa ( 28 ) . 
Our data suggest that susceptibility to Sal-monella infection in HIV disease could not only be consequent on CD4 immunodeﬁciency , but in the context of lymphopenia might also further exacerbate CD4 depletion . 
In summary , our data highlight two important points : ﬁrst , the roles of OX40 and CD30 signals in sustaining CD4 Th1 responses and , second , the synergy between lymphopenia and concurrent S. typhimurium infection in rendering CD4 T cells dependent on OX40 and CD30 survival signals . 
Pinpointing human LTI will establish whether they are deleted in HIV disease , although the promiscuous expression of CD4 on many different cell types in humans makes this task difﬁcult .
