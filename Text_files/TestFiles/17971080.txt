Salmonella enterica serovars , which cause a range of human diseases from gastro-enteritis to typhoid fever , the virulence factors that facilitate invasion of the host 's intes-tinal epithelium are encoded by a ~ 40 kb region referred to as Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) . 
Originally described as the inv/spa genes ( Galan and Curtiss , 1989 ) , SPI-1 is an horizontally acquired cluster of ~ 35 protein-coding genes inserted between the fhlA and mutS loci , and not found in closely related enterobacterial genomes . 
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 is the best characterized of the ﬁve major pathogenicity islands ( PAI ) presently known in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimu-rium ) ( Hensel , 2004 ) . 
It encodes a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) that mediates the translocation of effector proteins from Salmonella into mammalian cells ( Kimbrough and Miller , 2002 ; Galan and Wolf-Watz , 2006 ) . 
Genetic and biochemical analyses have assigned functions to most of the SPI-1-encoded proteins , either as components and secreted effectors of the T3SS apparatus , or as transcription factors that orchestrate SPI-1 expression ( Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ; Galan and Wolf-Watz , 2006 ) . 
While traditional genome annotation and analyses have focused on protein-coding regions , genes for small noncoding RNAs ( sRNAs ) have long been overlooked . 
Such sRNAs are typically transcribed from intergenic , i.e. nonprotein coding , regions of bacterial chromosomes ( Vogel and Sharma , 2005 ) . 
Recent genome-wide screens using diverse methodologies have identiﬁed ~ 80 sRNA genes in non-pathogenic Escherichia coli K12 , many of which are conserved in Salmonella and related pathogenic entero-bacterial species ( Hershberg et al. , 2003 ) . 
More recently , sRNA genes were also identiﬁed in bacterial pathogens other than enterobacteria ( Pichon and Felden , 2005 ; Christiansen et al. , 2006 ; Livny et al. , 2006 ; Mandin et al. , 2007 ) . 
Where characterized in detail , the majority of the sRNAs were found to act as antisense RNAs on trans-encoded target mRNAs to modulate their translation and/or stability ( Storz et al. , 2004 ) . 
Pairing to target mRNAs is typically mediated by short , imperfect stretches of complementarity and requires the bacterial Sm-like protein Hfq ( Valentin-Hansen et al. , 2004 ) . 
The sRNAs play diverse physiological roles in stress responses , regulation of metabolism , control of bacterial 
Summary 
The Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI-1 ) encodes ~ 35 proteins involved in assembly of a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) which endows Salmonella with the ability to invade eukaryotic cells . 
We have discovered a novel SPI-1 gene , invR , which expresses an abundant small non-coding RNA ( sRNA ) . 
The invR gene , which we identiﬁed in a global search for new Salmo-nella sRNA genes , is activated by the major SPI-1 transcription factor , HilD , under conditions that favour host cell invasion . 
The RNA chaperone , Hfq , is essential for the in vivo stability of the ~ 80 nt InvR RNA . 
Hfq binds InvR with high affinity in vitro , and InvR co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG epitope-tagged Hfq in Salmonella extracts . 
Surprisingly , deletion/overexpression of invR revealed no phenotype in SPI-1 regulation . 
In contrast , we ﬁnd that InvR represses the synthesis of the abundant OmpD porin encoded by the Salmonella core genome . 
As invR is conserved in the early branching Salmonella bongori , we speculate that porin repression by InvR may have aided successful establishment of the SPI-1 T3SS after horizontal acquisition in the Salmonella lineage . 
This study identiﬁes the ﬁrst regulatory RNA of an enterobacterial pathogenicity island , and new roles for Hfq and HilD in SPI-1 gene expression .

However , despite the importance of Salmonella as a health risk and a model pathogen , little is known about non-coding sRNA functions in the various Salmonella species , and no sRNAs have been reported from Salmonella-speciﬁc virulence regions . 
In this work , we have discovered a novel SPI-1 gene that encodes a regulatory sRNA , referred to as InvR ( invasion gene-associated RNA ) . 
The SPI-1 transcription factor , HilD , and the sRNA chaperone , Hfq , were both identiﬁed as being strictly required for InvR expression and stability respectively . 
Unlike other SPI-1 genes , invR does not seem to be involved in effector secretion by the SPI-1 T3SS . 
Instead , InvR is an Hfq-dependent sRNA that acts outside SPI-1 to regulate outer membrane protein ( OmpD ) synthesis post-transcriptionally . 
Collectively , our data describe a new , unsuspected gene within SPI-1 , identify a role of Hfq in the expression of a horizontally acquired virulence region , and reveal an unexpected link between SPI-1 and the Salmonella core genome . 
Results
Identiﬁcation of a non-coding RNA gene in SPI-1
The invR gene was identiﬁed using a biocomputational search for novel sRNAs in S. typhimurium . 
Similar to recent sRNA searches in E. coli ( Argaman et al. , 2001 ; Chen et al. , 2002 ) , we performed a search for ` orphan ' pairs of s70-type promoters and r-independent transcription terminators in the intergenic regions ( IGRs ) of the Salmonella LT2 genome ( see Experimental procedures ) . 
This search predicted 46 candidates of Salmonella sRNA genes which are not conserved in E. coli K12 ( Table 1 and Table S1 ) . 
Many of these sRNA candidate genes appear to be conserved in the early branching Salmonella species , S. bongori . 
Comparison of the genomic location of these candidate genes to the co-ordinates of well-established Salmonella virulence regions ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) revealed an overlap of candidate STnc270 ( invR ) with the invasion gene island , SPI-1 ( Fig. 1A and B ) . 
The invR gene resides in the 91 bp IGR between invH and STM2901 , and is encoded on the same strand as these latter two genes ( Fig. 1A ) . 
invH encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein required for a functional outer membrane translocation complex of the SPI-1 T3SS ( Altmeyer et al. , 1993 ; Crago and Koronakis , 1998 ; Daeﬂer and Russel , 1998 ) , and it is the last gene at the right border of the island with a deﬁned SPI-1 function . 
The function of STM2901 is unknown . 
A s70-type promoter was predicted ~ 70 bp downstream of the invH stop codon ; this promoter is followed closely by a 7 bp inverted repeat and a stretch of T residues , characteristic of r-independent transcription terminators ( Fig. 1C ) . 
These features are conserved in putative invR genes of other Salmonella species for which genome sequences are available , including the early branching S. bongori ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Northern blot analysis of the invR locus detected an ~ 80 nt RNA in total RNA samples prepared from various stages of Salmonella growth in L-broth ( Fig. 2A , lanes 1 -- 6 ) . 
The size of the InvR RNA was in perfect agreement with the promoter/terminator predictions . 
Notably , invR expression is highly growth rate-dependent and peaks in early stationary phase ( OD600 of 2 ) , a pattern reminiscent of SPI-1 gene transcription under aerobic growth ( Lee and Falkow , 1990 ; Song et al. , 2004 ) . 
To determine whether invR was co-regulated with SPI-1 genes , we probed total RNA isolated from Salmonella grown under low oxygen tension and/or high osmolarity ( 0.3 M NaCl ) , conditions known to activate SPI-1 gene expression in vitro ( Lee and Falkow , 1990 ; Song et al. , 2004 ) . 
Consistent with a co-regulation with SPI-1 genes , InvR levels dramatically increased during oxygen limitation compared with growth with aeration , and were further elevated by high osmolarity ( Fig. 2B ) . 
The bacterial alarmone , ppGpp ( guanosine tetraphosphate ) , was recently identiﬁed as being required for SPI-1 gene expression ( Pizarro-Cerdá and Tedin , 2004 ; Song et al. , 2004 ; Thompson et al. , 2006 ) . 
Functional deletion of both ppGpp synthetase genes , relA and spoT , reduced the expression of SPI-1 transcription activators , and consequently invasion gene transcription . 
To test if invR expression is also affected by ppGpp synthesis , we compared InvR levels in wild type and a DrelA/DspoT mutant strain at various growth points ranging from exponential to stationary phase . 
Figure 2A ( lanes 7 -- 12 ) shows that invR is expressed in the ppGpp mutant at lower levels compared with wild-type Salmonella , although the pattern of InvR accumulation during the growth phase is unaffected . 
invR is an independent gene 
The predicted invR gene is located downstream of the invH gene and in the same orientation . 
As invH does not seem to possess a r-independent transcription terminator ( Fig. 1C ) , to determine whether InvR was a primary transcript or a processed species of the upstream encoded invH mRNA , the invR region was deleted from the Salmo-nella chromosome , and re-introduced by integration into the distant istR-tisAB locus ( Vogel et al. , 2004 ) with a 478 bp DNA fragment containing invR and its upstream region ( C-terminal portion of invH ) . 
The complemented strain yielded an InvR-speciﬁc Northern blot signal identical to the wild type ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The same invR DNA fragment born on plasmid ( pinvR ) also fully restored InvR expression in the DinvR strain ( Fig . 
S1 ) . 
As the above results suggested that InvR is a primary transcript , we carried out a 5 ′ RACE experiment involving tobacco acid pyrophosphatase ( TAP ; cleaves 5 ′ - triphosphates ) treatment to map the transcription start site of the sRNA gene ( Bensing et al. , 1996 ; Vogel et al. , 
2003 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 3B , treatment of RNA with TAP prior to 5 ′ RNA linker ligation resulted in a strongly enhanced 5 ′ RACE signal for invR transcripts ( lane T + ) , indicating that InvR RNA carries a 5 ′ - triphosphate group characteristic of primary transcripts . 
Cloning of this 5 ′ RACE fragment positioned the transcription start site at the G residue that is located 7 bp downstream of the invR

The results therefore all support the conclusion that InvR is encoded by an independent gene . 
InvR RNA is abundant and stable
InvR hybridization yielded a strong signal on Northern blots as compared with other Salmonella RNAs , suggesting that the RNA is abundant . 
Thus , we determined the in vivo copy number of the RNA at early stationary phase ( OD600 of 2 ) , i.e. when InvR expression peaks under standard laboratory growth conditions . 
Cellular InvR levels were compared in Northern blots relative to known quantities of a slightly longer in vitro synthesized InvR transcript ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Quantiﬁcation of the hybridization signals put the cellular copy number of InvR at this point of growth at > 100 molecules per cell . 
We next tested the in vivo stability of the RNA in rifampicin-treatment experiments . 
As shown in Fig. 3D , InvR levels showed little change within 30 min after a total block of transcription , i.e. the RNA decays with a half-life > 30 min . 
Thus , InvR is both abundant and stable , with an intrinsic half-life exceeding that of many other sRNAs ( Vogel et al. , 2003 ) .

Hfq is essential for InvR accumulation
Many of the sRNAs that are conserved among diverse enterobacteria associate with the bacterial Sm-like protein , Hfq , and require the protein for both intracellular stability and regulatory function . 
In contrast , the role of Hfq for sRNAs encoded by recently acquired virulence regions or bacterial plasmids is less understood ( Huntzinger et al. , 2005 ; Will and Frost , 2006 ; Boisset et al. , 2007 ) . 
As Hfq was previously implicated in SPI-1 gene expression ( Sittka et al. , 2007 ) , we tested whether Hfq was also required for InvR expression . 
Northern blot analysis of a Salmonella hfq mutant grown either under standard ( Fig. 4A ) or SPI-1-inducing conditions ( not shown ) revealed a complete loss of InvR accumulation in this genetic background . 
We recently showed that Hfq-dependent sRNAs can accumulate to high levels when expressed from a constitutive PLlacO-1 promoter in an E. coli hfq mutant strain ( Urban and Vogel , 2007 ) . 
However , this strategy failed to produce abundant InvR RNA in the Salmonella hfq mutant strain ( Fig. 4B ) , arguing that Hfq primarily affects InvR stability . 
To conﬁrm this , we fused the invR promoter to a transcriptional reporter gene , and observed that invR promoter activity was not affected by the hfq mutation ( Fig. 5B ) . 
To determine whether Hfq and InvR can directly interact , the RNA was synthesized in vitro , and Hfq binding was assayed in gel mobility shift experiments ( Fig. 4C ) . 
InvR binds Hfq with high affinity and an apparent KD of ~ 10 nM . 
Hfq typically binds to sRNAs in A/U-rich , often single-stranded regions ( Valentin-Hansen et al. , 2004 ) , and an extended A/U-rich region is found immediately upstream of the invR terminator stem-loop region ( Fig. 1C ) . 
To test whether InvR is associated with Hfq in vivo , we sought to co-immunoprecipitate the RNA in bacterial extracts . 
As preliminary experiments with polyclonal antisera raised against puriﬁed Salmonella Hfq protein failed to yield sufficient amounts of immunoprecipitated RNA ( data not shown ) , we resorted to a generic method that involves the expression of an epitope-tagged Hfq protein . 
The chromosomal hfq gene was modiﬁed such that it expresses Hfq with a C-terminal 3xFLAG epitope tag ( Uzzau et al. , 2001 ) . 
The resulting strain , hfq FLAG , was indistinguishable from the wild type in terms of growth and in vitro virulence assays , e.g. gentamicin protection assay , indicating that the 3xFLAG-tag does not impair Hfq function ( Fig . 
S2 ) . 
Northern blot analysis of RNA precipitated with Hfq : : FLAG protein revealed a strong enrichment of InvR as compared with the control reaction ( Fig. 4D ) . 
Thus , the sRNA is very likely to be present in a complex with Hfq in vivo .

The invR gene belongs to the SPI-1 regulon and is activated by HilD
Next , we asked whether invR transcription was under the control of SPI-1-encoded transcription factors . 
The activation of SPI-1 genes is mediated in response to growth rate and environmental conditions by a transcription factor cascade ( Ellermeier and Slauch , 2007 ) . 
On top of this cascade , the transcription factors HilC and HilD , along with RtsA ( encoded outside SPI-1 ) , cooperate to transmit environmental signals that lead to de-repression of hilA ( Bajaj et al. , 1996 ; Lucas and Lee , 2001 ; Schechter and Lee , 2001 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
HilA is the SPI-1 major transcriptional activator responsible for most of the SPI-1 T3SS and effector gene expression , both directly and indirectly through its activation of InvF ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ; Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ) . 
To test whether invR was dependent on any of the four SPI1-encoded transcription factors , InvR RNA levels were quantiﬁed in strains with disruptions in the individual transcription factor genes . 
Figure 5A shows that loss of HilD caused a dramatic ( 50-fold ) reduction in InvR levels . 
Severely reduced activity of the invR promoter fusion in this background argues that HilD regulates invR at the transcriptional level ( Fig. 5B ) . 
In contrast , a hilC mutation reduced InvR levels less than twofold compared with the wild-type strain , and had only a marginal effect on the invR promoter activity . 
Disruptions in the hilA or invF genes had no effect on InvR levels ( Fig. 5A ) . 
We next tested if ectopically expressed HilD would restore invR transcription in the hilD mutant . 
The hilD mutant and wild-type strains were transformed with plasmid pBAD-HilD which carries the hilD gene under control of an arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter , and InvR levels were determined at early stationary phase in the presence or absence of the inducer ( Fig. 5C ) . 
Quantiﬁcation of the Northern blot signals revealed that pBAD-HilD induction resulted in a 75-fold upregulation of invR expression in the hilD strain , thus fully complementing this mutant . 
Induction of pBAD-HilD also elevated InvR levels in wild-type cells ( threefold ) , suggesting that the invR promoter can be further activated when HilD is highly expressed . 
In contrast , arabinose did not induce invR in the presence of a pBAD control vector . 
We also tested whether HilD could activate invR in the absence of any other SPI1 genes . 
To this end , the entire SPI-1 region with the exception of invR ( strain DsitA-invH ) was deleted in the Salmonella chromosome . 
pBAD-HilD fully activated invR expression in this mutant background ( Fig. 5D ) . 
In contrast , a pBAD-HilA plasmid failed to restore invR expression , consistent with unchanged InvR levels in the hilA mutant ( Fig. 5D ) . 
To further validate a direct HilD role in invR regulation , we examined binding of the puriﬁed transcription factor to a 5 ′ labelled invR promoter double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) fragment in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) in vitro . 
Fragments containing the hilA promoter , known to be recognized by HilD ( Schechter and Lee , 2001 ) , served as positive control . 
The promoter of the E. coli lacZ gene , which is not recognized by HilD , was included as negative control . 
The fragments were incubated with increasing concentrations of puriﬁed HilD protein , and the resulting complexes were separated on native polyacrylamide gels . 
Figure 6 shows that HilD formed a singular complex with the invR promoter fragment at a concentration ( < 5 nM ) similar to that required to shift the hilA promoter , whereas no complex formation was obtained with the lacZ control fragment . 
Cumulatively , the data indicate that invR is a novel member of the SPI1 regulon , and that its promoter is activated directly by HilD .

InvR does not engage in SPI-1 regulation or secretion The conservation of invR as part of SPI-1 and its expression under conditions activating SPI-1-driven host cell invasion suggested an involvement of InvR in SPI-1-encoded functions . 
One major SPI-1 function is the secretion of effector proteins . 
Analysis of the proteins of culture supernatants from Salmonella provides a rough measure of SPI-1 gene induction and the intactness of the SPI-1 secretion apparatus . 
Surprisingly , neither loss nor ectopically driven overexpression of InvR consistently changed the pattern of secreted effector proteins in early stationary phase ( Fig. 7A ) and under SPI-1-inducing conditions ( Fig. 7B ) . 
Next , to measure a possible role of invR for SPI-1 secretion more sensitively , translocation assays using a fusion of the SPI-1 effector protein , SipA ( also known as SspA ) , to TEM-1 b-lactamase were performed ( Charpentier and Oswald , 2004 ; Raffatellu et al. , 2005 ) ; SipA trans-location had been established by others as a sensitive reporter of an intact SPI-1 secretion apparatus ( e.g. Bronstein et al. , 2000 ; Lilic et al. , 2006 ) . 
The sipA fusion is under control of the sipA promoter , thus the assay will also be sensitive to any alterations in SPI-1 gene transcription . 
We found no indication for a role for InvR in SipA-b-lactamase translocation into COS7 cells ( Fig . 
S3 ) . 
These results strongly suggest that InvR is not involved in SPI-1-dependent secretion , which is supported by preliminary results from an array of Salmonella virulence assays ( V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel , unpubl . 
results ) . 
InvR represses the abundant OmpD protein As InvR is Hfq-dependent , we predicted it to act on trans-encoded mRNA ( s ) . 
To identify putative InvR targets , we compared the total protein patterns ( Fig. 8A ) of wild-type Salmonella , the isogenic DinvR strain , and DinvR strains complemented with two multicopy plasmids , pinvR and pPL-invR , which overexpress InvR to different degrees ( Fig. 8B ) . 
InvR overexpression ( plasmid pPL-invR ) caused the depletion of an abundant 40 kDa protein ( Fig. 8A ) identiﬁed by mass spectrometry analysis of the excised band as the major outer membrane protein , OmpD ( also known as NmpC ) . 
The concomitant increase in OmpC levels caused by plasmid pPL-invR is most likely due to OmpD depletion rather than InvR expression as it is also observed in a DompD strain ( Fig. 8A ) . 
The InvR-dependent regulation was even more pronounced at the ompD mRNA level . 
Northern blots showed that InvR affects ompD mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner ; ompD mRNA levels were increased in the DinvR strain but gradually reduced to background levels upon intermediate or strong invR overexpression from plasmids pinvR and pPL-invR respectively ( Fig. 8B ) . 
To address whether InvR regulates ompD transcription or targets the ompD mRNA post-transcriptionally , we mapped the ompD transcription start site ( Fig . 
S4 ) and constructed a transcriptional ompD -- gfp fusion ( Fig . 
S5 ) . 
InvR overexpression had no effect on the ompD -- gfp fusion expression ( Fig . 
S5 ) , indicating post-transcriptional regulation of ompD . 
This was also supported by the kinetics of sRNA-dependent ompD mRNA depletion . 
Induction of invR expression from plasmid pBAD-InvR accelerated ompD mRNA decay to a half-life of < 4 min ( Fig. 8C ) . 
As the normal half-life of ompD mRNA under these conditions is 10 min ( Sittka et al. , 2007 ) , this strongly indicated that InvR directly targets ompD mRNA .

D. Induced HilD expression complements invR expression to a SPI-1 disruption strain ( spi-1 is deleted from sitA to invH ) . 
Strains carrying the same plasmids were induced as in ( C ) . 
A strain carrying a HilA expression plasmid ( pBAD-HilA ) was included as further control . 
Direct negative regulation by Hfq-binding sRNAs is usually dependent on base-pairing with the 5 ′ UTR of target omp mRNAs near the ribosome binding site ( Guillier et al. , 2006 ; Vogel and Papenfort , 2006 ) . 
An extended interaction between InvR and the ompD mRNA was predicted using the RNAhybrid program ( Rehms-meier et al. , 2004 ) ( Fig. 8D ) . 
Gel mobility shift assays of either labelled InvR RNA with unlabelled 5 ′ region of ompD RNA or vice versa showed that the two RNAs form a stable complex in vitro ( Fig . 
S6A ) . 
Furthermore in vitro structure probing with both RNAs using T1 ribonuclease ( cleaves at the 3 ′ end of single stranded G residues ) and lead ( II ) ( cleaves RNA in single-stranded regions , loops and bulges ) supports the predicted interaction between InvR and ompD mRNA in vitro ( Fig . 
S6B and C ) . 
In summary , these results indicate that post-transcriptional repression of OmpD synthesis by InvR RNA involves spe-ciﬁc base-pairing to ompD mRNA . 
Discussion
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 is one of the most intensely studied bacterial virulence regions . 
The ~ 35 SPI-1 genes encode proteins involved in the assembly of a membrane-spanning supramolecular structure , the T3SS or needle complex , through which effector proteins are secreted into eukaryotic host cells to facilitate Salmo-nella invasion . 
These genes within SPI-1 encode not only proteins making up the secretion apparatus , but also chaperones , secreted effector proteins and a number of transcription factors involved in the regulation and timing of expression . 
Here we report a new type of SPI-1 gene , expressing a non-coding RNA not directly involved in SPI-1 regulation or T3SS function , but which affects gene expression of the core Salmonella genome . 
There is evidence to suggest that invR is an ` ancient ' gene , horizontally acquired along with the SPI-1 virulence region in the ﬁrst major phase of Salmonella evolution . 
InvR is highly conserved in Salmonella species ( Fig. 1A ) , including the early branching S. bongori that diverged from the S. enterica lineage after acquisition of SPI-1 ( Reeves et al. , 1989 ; Groisman and Ochman , 1994 ) . 
SPI-1 has a signiﬁcantly lower average G+C content ( 47 % ) than the core Salmonella genome ( 52 % ) , and the invR gene ( 39.6 % G+C ) shares this low G+C content region ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Salmonella evolution has resulted in a mosaic structure of the right SPI-1 border ( invH-mutS region ) . 
However , these insertions/deletions neither affected invR nor its close association with invH ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Finally , invR is co-regulated with other SPI-1 genes and strictly requires HilD , the transcription factor that acts at the top of the SPI-1 transcriptional hierarchy ( reviewed in Jones , 2005 ; Ellermeier and Slauch , 2007 ) . 
HilD is not known to control genes outside SPI-1 , except rtsA whose gene product is also involved in SPI-1 transcription ( Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Thus , genomic location , conservation and regulation all argue that invR was acquired along with SPI-1 very early at ( or soon after ) the divergence of the E. coli and the Salmonella lineages . 
The invR sequence appears to be more conserved than its boundaries ( Fig. 1C ) , which argues that invR is maintained by selection and that it is a functional gene , i.e. despite the lack of evidence that InvR functions in SPI-1 effector secretion or translocation . 
The function of InvR as a repressor of OmpD synthesis reveals a novel coupling between SPI-1 and Salmo-nella core genome expression ( summarized in Fig. 9 ) . 
SPI-1 is regulated by more than a dozen stress -- response regulators which respond to environmental stimuli relevant to host cell invasion , and which are collectively encoded by the Salmonella core genome ( Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ; Jones , 2005 ; Ellermeier and Slauch , 2007 ) . 
Since its horizontal acquisition , SPI-1 has increasingly come under control of common Salmonella core genome regulators , namely those involved in responses to conditions found at appropriate anatomic locations in the host . 
The reciprocal case , i.e. that SPI-1 controls other loci of the Salmonella chromosome , was previously limited to SPI-4 and SPI-5 , virulence islands activated by the SPI-1 transcription factor , HilA ( Ahmer et al. , 1999 ) . 
This study shows that the SPI-1 virulence region also encodes a post-transcriptional regulator of Salmonella core genome expression , adding a new layer of cross-talk between these regions . 
Similar to our discovery of the Salmonella PAI-encoded InvR , there is evidence that other horizontally acquired elements such as cryptic prophage regions of E. coli express sRNAs to interfere with gene expression from the host chromosome , e.g. the DicF and IpeX RNAs ( Tetart and Bouche , 1992 ; Castillo-Keller et al. , 2006 ) . 
We recently demonstrated that the sRNA chaperone , Hfq , is involved in SPI-1 expression and/or functions

As in ( B ) Northern blots were probed for ompD mRNA , InvR and 5S rRNA ( loading control ) . 
Quantiﬁcation of the ompD signals revealed that InvR expression reduces the half-life of the mRNA to less than 4 min . 
D. Predicted antisense interaction of InvR RNA and ompD mRNA . 
Numbers denote the interacting residues in the ompD mRNA or InvR RNA ( relative to the mapped +1 sites ) . 
( Sittka et al. , 2007 ) . 
Moreover , loss of Hfq results in aberrant levels of porins and other envelope proteins ( Figueroa-Bossi et al. , 2006 ; Sittka et al. , 2007 ) , the most marked defect being a strong accumulation of OmpD ( Sittka et al. , 2007 ) . 
As the latter was due to defective translational repression , we hypothesized the existence of Hfq-dependent sRNAs that repress the ompD mRNA ( Sittka et al. , 2007 ) . 
Following the earlier discovery of the 
RybB sRNA ( Papenfort et al. , 2006 ) , InvR is here revealed as another sRNA to conﬁrm this expectation . 
Note , however , that RybB and InvR act under different conditions ; RybB is strictly controlled by the alternative sigma factor , sE , and is induced upon envelope stress ( Johansen et al. , 2006 ; Papenfort et al. , 2006 ; Thompson et al. , 2007 ) , whereas InvR acts under conditions that favour SPI-1 gene expression . 
Fig. 9 . 
Proposed model of SPI1-mediated porin repression . 
Two component systems encoded by the Salmonella core genome sense environmental signals that lead to activation of the SPI-1 transcription factor cascade ( HilD , HilC , HilA , InvF ) , and subsequently , to the expression of the SPI-1 T3SS . 
HilD also activates expression of the SPI-1-encoded , non-coding InvR RNA . 
Together with the RNA chaperone Hfq , InvR acts to repress synthesis of the major outer membrane protein , OmpD , which is encoded by the Salmonella core genome . 
OmpD is the most abundant Salmonella porin ( > 1 ¥ 105 molecules per cell ; Lee and Schnaitman , 1980 ) . 
The ompD gene is regulated at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional level ( Santiviago et al. , 2003 ) , and even a slight increase in OmpD protein levels by ectopic expression can trigger cell lysis , presumably by compromising envelope stability ( V. Pfeiffer and J. Vogel , unpubl . 
data ) . 
Intriguingly , several E. coli sRNAs that repress abundant outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) are encoded adjacent to other omp genes , with which they may have been horizontally acquired ( Douchin et al. , 2006 ; Guillier et al. , 2006 ; Vogel and Papenfort , 2006 ) . 
It has been suggested that as excess OMP synthesis can be deleterious , such sRNAs have evolved to modulate the synthesis of OMPs already present in the recipient strain until newly acquired OMPs become established ( Douchin et al. , 2006 ) . 
The recent demonstration that E. coli IpeX sRNA , which originates from the transcript of a phage-derived porin gene , represses other major porins lends support to this hypothesis ( Castillo-Keller et al. , 2006 ) . 
In analogy , the InvRmediated repression of OmpD may have provided an evolutionary advantage for establishing the membrane-anchored T3SS structure upon the arrival of SPI-1 in the Salmonella lineage by balancing envelope stability . 
Subsequently , InvR may have evolved additional functions in Salmonella gene expression . 
Generally , porins such as OmpD provide surfaceexposed epitopes used by the host 's immune response after infection ( Singh et al. , 2000 ) , and the immunostimmulatory activity of Salmonella OMPs has been well established ( Galdiero et al. , 1990 ; 1993 ; Vitiello et al. , 2004 ) . 
Preliminary experiments with the invR and ompD mutant strains failed to detect signiﬁcant changes in the production of the cytokine IL-8 in HeLa cells upon Salmonella infection ( V. Pfeiffer and J. Vogel , unpubl . 
data ) . 
However , too little is currently known as to the physiological roles of OmpD ( Santiviago et al. , 2002 ) . 
Although the protein facilitates Salmonella adherence to human macrophages and intes-tinal epithelial cell lines ( Negm and Pistole , 1998 ; Hara-Kaonga and Pistole , 2004 ) , its overall contribution to pathogenicity has not been clear ( Dorman et al. , 1989 ; Meyer et al. , 1998 ) . 
Thus , future work will focus on the identiﬁcation of an experimental system in which phenotypes of invR or ompD mutants can be studied . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used as the wild-type strain and for mutant construction . 
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables 2 and 3 . 
Growth under standard and SPI-1-inducing conditions , including antibiotic concentrations , was performed as described in Sittka et al. ( 2007 ) . 
A culture grown to an OD600 of 2 is referred to as early stationary-phase culture throughout the manuscript . 
For culture grown under low oxygen conditions , 35 ml in Schott ﬂasks was inoculated 1:100 and incubated at 37 °C , 50 r.p.m. Samples were taken at an OD of 0.4 or 2 . 
For expression of HilD and HilA from an inducible PBAD promoter , strains carrying plasmids ( pCH112 , pSA4 ) were cultured to an OD600 of 1 . 
After splitting the culture , one was induced for 45 min by addition of L-arabinose ( ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 % ) . 
To induce the expression of invR from the PBAD promoter , cultures were grown to an OD600 of 2 and induced with a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2 % L-arabinose for 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 min . 
Strain construction
Chromosomal mutagenesis of Salmonella SL1344 followed the protocol described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) with few modiﬁcations as described in Sittka et al. ( 2007 ) . 
For construction of the invR deletion strain ( JVS-00175 ) , the kan resistance cassette gene was ampliﬁed with oligonucleotides JVO-0299 / -0300 ( see Table 4 for sequences of deoxyoligo-nucleotides used as PCR primers and Northern blot probes ) from plasmid pKD4 . 
Mutants were veriﬁed by colony PCR using the oligonucleotides JVO-0301 / -0302 . 
For removal of the kan marker the DinvR strain was transformed with the FLP helper plasmid pCP20 ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
For invR complementation at the istR-tisAB locus , a istRtisAB : : cat deletion strain ( JVS-00608 ) was constructed . 
The cat chloramphenicol resistance cassette gene was ampliﬁed from plasmid pKD3 with oligonucleotides JVO-0710 / -0711 and transformed into wild-type SL1344 harbouring plasmid pKD46 . 
The deletion was veriﬁed by colony PCR using primers JVO-0037 / -0038 . 
For complementation of invR under control of either a PL promoter or the native promoter at the istR-tisAB locus , DNA fragments were ampliﬁed from plasmid pJV872-5 or pVP011 , respectively , using primers JVO-0713 / -0712 . 
The cat gene was ampliﬁed using JVO-0710 / -0203 . 
The cat gene and the invR PCR products were used as templates for a fusion PCR protocol to generate PL-invR : : cat and invR : : cat with primer pair JVO-0710 / -0712 and were transformed as above . 
The DistR-tisAB : : cat : : PL-invR , the DistR-tisAB : : cat : : invR locus , as well as DistR-tisAB : : cat , respectively , were transduced using phage P22 into the DinvR strain ( KmR removed ; JVS-00487 ) , generating JVS-00610 / -00632 / -00609 . 
The sitA-invH deletion strain was generated by insertion of the kan resistance gene of plasmid pKD4 ( PCR with primers JVO-0545 / -0546 ) and veriﬁed by colony PCR with JVO-0547 / -0302 . 
The construction of the chromosomal hfqFLAG strain followed the protocol published by Uzzau et al. ( 2001 ) . 
Wild-type Salmonella SL1344 containing plasmid pKD46 was transformed with a PCR product generated on plasmid pSUB11 and using primers JVO-0935 / -0936 . 
Integration yields a strain carrying hfq : : FLAG : : kan. . 
Veriﬁcation was carried out using oligos JVO-0076 / -0077 in colony PCR . 
After transduction into fresh wild-type background using phage P22 , the kanamycin resistance gene was eliminated using pCP20 ( see above ) , resulting in strain JVS-01338 . 
Plasmids
To clone the invR gene , a PCR product ampliﬁed with JVO-0301 / -0302 was digested with XbaI/XhoI and ligated into 
XbaI/XhoI cut plasmids pZE12-luc , yielding pRT2 ( ColE1 plasmid ) , or pVP003 , yielding pVP011 ( pSC101 * origin ) . 
Oligo JVO-0301 binds 256 nt upstream of the +1 site of invR , while JVO-0302 binds 131 nt downstream of the invR terminator . 
For generating a plasmid that overexpresses invR from a P promoter ( pJV872-5 ) , a PCR fragment ampliﬁed LlacO with oligos pZE-XbaI and JVO-0365 ( the latter binds to the +1 site of invR ) from template pRT2 plasmid was cloned into pZE12-luc as outlined in Vogel et al. ( 2004 ; cf. construction of P - IstR plasmids ) . 
L Transcriptional P -- gfp fusion plasmid pVP021 was coninvR structed by cloning an AatII/NheI-digested PCR fragment ( primers JVO-1276 / 1277 ) into plasmid pAS0046 digested with the same enzymes . 
The cloned region spans from -386 nt to +16 nt corresponding to the +1 site of invR . 
All plasmids were puriﬁed using the Machery-Nagel Plasmid QuickPure Kit . 
E. coli TOP 10 and TOP 10F ′ strains were used for cloning . 
P22 transduction
P22 lysates were prepared from soft agar plate lysates of donor strains using P22 phage HT/105 -1 by standard procedures . 
Transductions were performed as described ( Sternberg and Maurer , 1991 ) using P22 phage HT/105 -1 . 
Identiﬁcation of Salmonella-speciﬁc small RNA genes
Genome sequences and annotations for Salmonella LT2 ( NC_003197 ) and E. coli K12 ( NC_000913 ) were downloaded from NCBI Genome Database ( ftp : / / ftp.ncbi.nih.gov / genomes/Bacteria / ) . 
For identifying putative sRNA encoding genes in this organism , we adopted an approach similar to Chen et al. ( 2002 ) . 
A database of Inter-Genic ( IG , sequence between annotated genes on either strand ) sequences , greater than or equal to 100 bp , was created using the GenBank annotation . 
RNAMotif ( Macke et al. , 2001 ) , which searches for RNA structure motifs , was used for identifying putative r-independent terminators in the IG sequences . 
The ` descriptor ' and scoring scheme used were the same as reported in Lesnik et al. ( 2001 ) . 
We then used pftools2 .3 ( Bucher et al. , 1996 ; http://www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/ftp-server/ pftools / ) for searching promoters in intergenic sequences . 
The proﬁle describing the promoter sequences for s70 of E. coli , included in pftools2 .3 package , was used together with a cut-off of 50 ( Chen et al. , 2002 ) . 
To identify putative sRNA-encoding genes , predicted promoters and terminators ( with score better than -4 ; Lesnik et al. , 2001 ) were combined such that both are positioned in the same intergenic sequence and are in the same orientation , and the resulting length ( between the end of the predicted promoter and the end of the predicted terminator ) is 50 bp and 350 bp . 
To identify sRNA genes present in Salmonella but not E. coli , predicted sRNA sequences were searched against a local database of E. coli genome using BLASTN . 
Sequences which gave hits with E-value better than 1E-05 or normalized score ( BLAST score divided by the length of sRNA ) better than 0.7 were discarded . 
The remaining sRNA sequences were further searched against NCBI database using BLASTN and were checked manually . 
Furthermore , sRNA sequences were searched against a local database of S. bongori genome ( ftp : / / ftp.sanger.ac.uk / pub/pathogens/Salmonella / ) using BLASTN with an E-value cut-off of 0.01 .

Stability experiments, RNA isolation and Northern hybridization
The detailed protocol for isolation , Northern blot detection , an stability determination of Salmonella RNAs , is described in Sittka et al. ( 2007 ) . 
InvR was detected with 32P-labelled oli-godeoxynucleotide JVO-0222 , whereas 5S rRNA signals were detected with labelled oligo JVO-0322 . 
The ompD mRNA was detected with a 32P-labelled riboprobe generated by in vitro transcription . 
For stability experiments , rifampicin was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 mg ml-1 . 
Northern blots and gels were visualized on a Phosphorimager ( FLA-3000 Series , Fuji ) , and band intensities quantiﬁed with AIDA software ( Raytest , Germany ) . 
5 Race
RNA was extracted from wild-type Salmonella grown to an OD600 of 2 , and treated with DNase I. Six micrograms of DNA-free RNA was treated with TAP ( Epicentre ; removes the b - and g-phosphate groups at the capped 5 ′ end of the RNA ) in the presence of SUPERase inhibitor ( 10 U ﬁnal in a 50 ml reaction ; Ambion ) at 37 °C for 30 min . 
Mock treatment of RNA was performed in the same reaction buffer but omitting the enzyme . 
Subsequently , RNA was ligated to a 5 ′ RNA-oligonucleotide adaptor ( 400 pmol per reaction ) using T4 RNA ligase ( 40 U per 20 ml reaction ) at 17 °C overnight , puri-ﬁed with a mixture of phenol : chloroform : isopropanol ( 25:24:1 v/v ) , and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of an ethanol / sodiumacetate ( 30:1 ) solution . 
Samples were re-suspended in 10 ml of water . 
Half of the ligated RNA was used for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) with a random hexamer oligonucleotide primer mix ( 250 ng per 20 ml reaction ) in the presence of SUPERase inhibitor ( 10 U ﬁnal ) using Superscript III RT ( 200 U ﬁnal ; Invitrogen ) and the following programme : 25 °C for 5 min , 50 °C for 60 min , 70 °C for 15 min . 
RNase H ( 1 U ) was added , followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min . 
Oligonucleotide JVO-0222 ( binds 44 bp downstream of the +1 site of invR ) and JVO-0367 ( antisense to the RNA linker ) were used to amplify the 5 ′ end InvR by PCR with 1.25 U of HotStar Taq polymerase and 1 ml of the cDNA in a 50 ml reaction ( incubation as follows : 95 °C for 10 min , 95 °C for 45 s , 58 °C for 45 s , 72 °C for 45 s , 35 cycles and 72 °C for 7 min ) . 
The PCR products were separated on a 3 % agarose gel . 
The TAP-speciﬁc band was cut , eluted and sequenced .

EMSA with puriﬁed HilD protein
To determine binding of HilD protein to the invR promoter region , we performed EMSA following the protocol by Olekh-novich and Kadner ( 2002 ) but with slight modiﬁcations . 
The promoter region of the invR , the hilA or the lacZ genes was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers JVO-0690 / -0222 ( bp -437 nt to +45 nt relative to the transcriptional start site ) , JVO-0688 / -0689 ( bp -292 nt to +19 nt ) or JVO-0273 / -0691 ( bp -121 nt to +85 nt ) respectively . 
The gel-puriﬁed fragments were 5 ′ - end-labelled with [ g-32P ] - ATP using polynucleotide kinase , and puriﬁed with the NucleoSpin Extract II kit ( Machery and Nagel ) . 
For the binding assay , 0.2 fmol ( 20 pM ﬁnal concentration ) labelled DNA fragments were incubated with 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 nM of puriﬁed HilD protein ( 90 mM stock , kindly provided by I.N. Olekhnovich ) for 20 min at 37 °C in binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , 50 mM KCl , 100 mg ml-1 BSA , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM EDTA ) in a 10 ml reaction . 
Dilutions of HilD were prepared in binding buffer . 
Three microli-tres of loading buffer ( 50 % glycerol , 0.5 ¥ TBE , 0.2 % bromphenolblue ) was added to the reaction . 
The mixture was separated on a running native 5 % polyacrylamide gel cooled to 4 °C at 300 V for 3 h 30 min . 
The dried gel was analysed using a phosphorimager .

Determination of in vivo abundance of InvR
Total RNA from the wild type at an OD600 of 2.0 ( a total of 3 OD ) was isolated using the TRIzol reagent , followed by DNase I treatment ( 3 OD corresponds to 3.3 ¥ 109 cells ) . 
The PCR template for in vitro transcription of invR with a T7 promoter was ampliﬁed with JVO-0675 / -0676 ( JVO-0675 adds a T7 promoter to the +1 site of invR ) . 
The DNA was transcribed in vitro using the Megascript kit ( Ambion ) , followed by a DNase I treatment and organic extraction . 
One hundred nanograms ( 3.6 pmol ) of the in vitro transcribed InvR RNA ( 88 nt ) corresponds to 2.13 ¥ 1012 molecules . 
Increasing amounts of the in vitro synthesized RNA were mixed with 5 ml of total RNA ( corresponding to 2.2 ¥ 108 cells ) and separated on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M Urea and subjected to Northern hybridization . 
In vitro binding experiments (gel mobility shift assays)
InvR RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase ( Megascript , Ambion ) from PCR fragments ampliﬁed with oligos JVO-0943 / -0676 . 
Binding assays , native gel electrophoresis and RNA visualization were performed as described in Sittka et al. ( 2007 ) . 
RNA and Hfq ( hexamer ) concentrations are given in the ﬁgure legends ( see Fig. 4C ) . 
Co-immunoprecipitation
The hfq gene was chromosomally tagged with a C-terminal 3xFLAG-tag sequence as described in Uzzau et al. ( 2001 ) , yielding strain hfqFLAG . 
Cells were cultured to early stationary phase , and collected by centrifugation ( 40 min , 4000 g , 4 °C ) . 
The pellet was washed once with 2 ml of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT ) , and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen . 
Upon re-suspension in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer , 0.8 ml glass beads ( Roth , diameter 0.1 mm ) were added , and cells broken by vortexing ( 30 s burst followed by 30 s chill on ice ) for 5 min . 
Lysis buffer ( 0.4 ml ) was added , followed by centrifugation [ 30 min at 4 °C , 16 000 relative centrifugation force ( RCF ) ] . 
The cleared lysate ( 0.1 ml ) was removed to prepare total RNA . 
Twenty-ﬁve microlitres of FLAG antibody ( Sigma ; #F1804 ) was added to the remaining cleared lysate ( 0.9 ml ) , followed by incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. Fifty microlitres Protein A sepharose beads ( Sigma ; P-6649-5ML ) were added , and incubation continued for 1 h . 
The suspension was centrifuged ( 5 min , 4 °C , 16 000 RCF ) , followed by ﬁve washes in 1 ml of lysis buffer . 
Protein/RNA complexes were recovered from the beads by re-suspension in 0.5 ml of water . 
Phenol : chloroform extracted RNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation , followed by DNase I treatment . 
For Northern blot detection , total RNA and co-immunoprecipitated RNA equivalent to 0.25 and 2.5 OD600 , respectively , of the original culture volume were used . 
GFP reporter assays
Strains carrying the transcriptional invR : : GFP fusion plasmid ( pVP021 ) or a control plasmid ( pAS0046 ) were inoculated in 
5 ml of LB containing 0.3 M NaCl supplemented with 20 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol in 15 ml Falcon tubes with a tightly closed lid . 
The cultures were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C . 
Culture ( 3 ¥ 100 ml ) was transferred to a 96-well plate , and ﬂuorescence was measured at 37 °C using a VICTOR3TM machine ( 1420 Multilable Counter , Perkin Elmer ) . 
All experiments were performed in triplicates . 
Strains with a non-ﬂuorescent plasmid served as background control ( autoﬂuorescence ) . 
A detailed protocol of ﬂuorescence measurement is given in Urban and Vogel ( 2007 ) . 
Secreted and whole-cell protein fractions
The protocol for extraction of secreted protein fractions was modiﬁed from the protocol described in Kaniga et al. ( 1995 ) . 
Culture samples were taken from regular LB cultures at an OD600 of 2 or from SPI-1-induced cultures , and spun 20 min at 16 100 g at 4 °C . 
Proteins from the supernatant were precipitated by adding 25 % TCA to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 % followed by 20 min centrifugation at 16 100 g , 4 °C . 
The pellet was washed twice in ice-cold acetone and air dried . 
The pellet was re-suspended in 1 ¥ SLB to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 OD per 10 ml . 
Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C . 
For small 12 % SDS-PAGE 1 OD , respectively , were loaded per sample . 
For whole-cell protein fractions 0.1 OD per 10 ml were separated on a 12 % SDS-PAGE , and visualized by staining with Sypro Ruby ( Bio-Rad ) .
