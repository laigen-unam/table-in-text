In order to design and validate a method to identify virulence genes of Salmonella typhimurium using DNA microarray , a protocol was developed to label the isolated bacterial DNA directly and to use PCR ampliﬁcation of limited numbers of genes to validate the hybridization signals . 
Therefore , a DNA microarray chip of 71 virulence genes of S. typhimurium was developed and evaluated using 10 isolates . 
Each gene was represented by 65 bp oligonucleotide probes ( oligoprobes ) and immobilized on the surface of chemically modiﬁed slides . 
Whole DNA genomes were digested with Hinf1 and Sau3AI , labeled with a ﬂuorescent tag of Cy3 and then hybridized . 
The presence of virulence genes in 10 strains of S. typhimurium was established by measuring a ﬂuorescent signal above the background noise of the chip . 
PCR ampliﬁcation of 10 genes ( orgA , ORF319 , ttrB , rmbA , misL , spi4F , spi4H , spi4N , rRNA , and purR ) of S. typhimurium was used as a standard to verify the conﬁdence level of the DNA microarray chip . 
In conclusion , using PCR ampliﬁcation to increase the conﬁdence level of the microarray hybridization data was 
successful .

1. Introduction
more than twice as much as the next most commonly occurring serovar , S. enteritidis ( 14.2 % ) , during this same period . 
The high throughput of gene sequencing in Salmonella has revealed the presence of large blocks of virulence genes 
Salmonella spp . 
are normally found in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals . 
They are Gram-negative facultative anaerobic non-endospore-forming rods that are usually motile and which ferment glucose to produce acid and gas . 
Salmonella 
called pathogenicity islands . 
The concentration of virulence genes in certain blocks of the genome probably indicates that the acquisition of the genes occurred by horizontal transfer from inter and intra-species . 
This transfer of the 
spp . 
are pathogenic and are the cause of human and animal diseases [ 14 ] . 
There are two species within the genus Salmonella : S. enterica and S. bongori . 
Within S. enterica there are six subspecies and each of these subspecies are further 
newly acquired genes was preserved later by vertical transfer from mother to daughter cells in a single pathogenic clone [ 20 ] . 
Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was shown to have ﬁve pathogenicity islands 
differentiated , serologically , into individual serovars . 
There are more than 2400 serovars within S. enterica . 
In the United States , Salmonella typhimurium was the most commonly isolated serovar ( 29.4 % ) from 1968 to 1998 [ 1 ] . 
It was isolated 
distributed throughout the t-RNA regions [ 9 ] . 
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) encodes for several proteins that are involved in invading epithelial cells and inducing apoptosis in macrophages . 
Most of these genes

SPI-2 genes are required for replication within the macrophages and for survival in mice when the bacterial cells are taken up by a 
macrophage .

DNA microarray chip . 
Ten of these virulence genes were ampliﬁed by PCR and used to examine the conﬁdence level of the DNA microarray data in 10 S. typhimurium strains . 
and is believed to augment the function of the two pathogenicity islands . 
The island encodes for an mgtBC operon that is involved in magnesium transport , which allows S. typhimurium to survive in a low Mg 2C environment [ 9 ] . 
SPI-4 encodes for SigDE , which was found to play a role in the invasion process into epithelial cells and can also be secreted by SPI-1 [ 18,19 ] . 
Finally , SPI-5 encodes sopE and it is ﬂanked by the genes for tail ¬

Bacterial strains and DNA preparation 
ﬁber proteins from a P1-like phage . 
The sopE gene produces a 25 kDa protein molecule that is secreted by SPI-1 and is required for maximal invasion activity [ 20 ] . 
Salmonella genotyping using molecular and non-molecular methods has been well documented in the literature [ 17 ] . 
Some of these methods , like pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) , are considered reliable strategies only when combined with plasmid proﬁling and ribotyping to differentiate between 
Biochemical tests were conducted to conﬁrm all the strains ( see Section 3 ) . 
Brain Heart Infusion ( BHI ) medium was used to grow the 10 S. typhimurium strains . 
Genomic bacterial DNA was isolated using Puregene DNA Isolation Kit ( Gentra Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) and it was used in PCR ampliﬁcation and chip hybridization . 
strains [ 17 ] . 
Fluorescent ampliﬁed fragment length polymorph-ism ( FAFLP ) [ 16 ] and multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis ( MLEE ) [ 10 ] , are alternative methods to study the genetic diversity between the Salmonella strains but these methods lack the ability to serotype strains . 
Recently , molecular identiﬁcation of Salmonella by DNA microarray chip technology has demonstrated some advances in high throughput screening to rapidly determine a complete

PFGE 
Agarose plugs of bacterial strains were prepared and digested as described previously [ 2 ] , and PFGE was performed with the CHEF MAPPER system ( BioRad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) in 1 % agarose gel and 0.5 ! 
TBE buffer at 14 8C . 
The running time was 19 h at 6 V/cm , with initial and ﬁnal switch times of 2.16 and 63.8 s , respectively . 
Genomic DNA of CDC strain H9812 , digested with XbaI , was used as reference ladder CHEF DNA Size Standard . 
The gel was stained with ethidium bromide ( 1 mg/ml ) , and the gel image captured with the Gel Doc 2000 system ( BioRad ) was analyzed with the BioNumerics ﬁngerprinting software ( Applied Maths , Sint-Martens-Latem , Belgium ) . 
genetic proﬁle of pathogenic microorganisms [ 3 -- 5,11 ] . 
In general , microarray chips , which can hold thousands of oligonucleotide probes per chip , show potential for simple and efﬁcient genotyping of many organisms in a single hybridization experiment [ 3 -- 5,11,22 ] . 
In the last 10 years , DNA microarray technology has contributed a wealth of information on gene expression as well as gene identiﬁcation . 
Our ability to study a few genes has been increased to investigate thousands of genes in a single set of experiments . 
But with the number of genes to be identiﬁed or studied increasing signiﬁcantly , irreproducibility among researchers and platforms in analyzing DNA microarray data detracts from the potential usefulness of this technology . 
In three recent studies of gene expression microarray reproducibility [ 8,13,15 ] , it was found that there are large differences in data analysis between 10 laboratories even when they used the same chip platform [ 13 ] . 
In addition , Larkin et al. [ 15 ] used 11

Design of PCR primers and gene-speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes 
Sequences of PCR primers used in the current study were newly designed for orgA , ORF319 , ttrB , rmbA , misL , spi4F , spi4H , spi4N , 16s rRNA , and purR ( Table 1 ) . 
Individual gene-speciﬁc oligoprobes were designed on the basis of unique sequences found in the target genes using ArrayDesigner software ( Premier Biosoft International , Palo Alto , CA ) ( Table 2 ) . 
The speciﬁcity of designed oligoprobes was assessed by using a BLAST search of homologous sequences available in GenBank . 
The goal of PCR ampliﬁcation was to test the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the chip hybridization . 
When the positive or negative signals in the chip were found not to match the PCR ampliﬁcation , some of the PCR products were sequenced ( see Section 3 ) . 
All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies , Inc. , Alameda , CA . 
quantitative RT-PCR analyses for randomly selected genes to understand the discrepancies between different hybridization data of two tested chips containing the same genes but produced by different labs . 
Only one gene , based on the RTPCR data , gave compatible conﬁrmation of the data obtained from the two chips . 
The other 10 genes appeared to have different expression proﬁles on the two chips . 
Therefore , it is quite obvious that microarray technology needs to be validated 
and ` debugged ' for robust reproducible results across different lab settings . 
In this work , our goals were to develop a protocol to bypass multiplex PCR ampliﬁcation , to increase the number of genes fabricated on the chip , and to have a reproducible method to test the conﬁdence level in microarray hybridization data . 
The 71-associated virulence genes of S. typhimurium located throughout the pathogenicity islands were selected to build a

Microchips were prepared using a contact microspotting robotic system , PixSys 5000 ( Cartesian Technologies , Inc. , Irvine , CA ) . 
The average size of the spots was 50 -- 100 mm . 
The concentration of each oligoprobe before printing was adjuste

to a total of 100 mM in a 50 % printing buffer ( 300 mM sodium phosphate , pH 8.5 ) : H2O . 
Oligoprobes were spotted on the CodeLink surface of activated slides and placed into a slide storage chamber partially ﬁlled with saturated NaCl at room temperature for overnight incubation . 
The slides were placed in a pre-warmed blocking solution ( 50 mM ethanolamine , 0.1 M Tris ( pH 9 ) ) at 50 8C for 30 min . 
After disposal of the blocking solution , the slides were rinsed twice with deionized water and washed with 4 ! 
SSC , 0.1 % SDS ( pre-warmed to 50 8C ) for 30 min with shaking to remove unbound oligonucleotides . 
Afterward , the slides were rinsed with deionized water and centrifuged ( spun-dry ) at 800 rpm for 3 min . 
The slides were stored at ambient temperature until used . 
digestions were conducted for each genomic DNA template . 
Subsequently , the DNA was puriﬁed using Qiagen kit and 1.5 mg of DNA was chemically labeled using the Micromax labeling kit ( Perkin -- Elmer Life Science , Inc. , Boston , MA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
The labeled DNA was puriﬁed , concentrated , and suspended in 10 ml of 1 ! 
hybridiz-ation buffer ( 5 ! 
Denhardt 's solution , 6 ! 
SSC , and 0.1 % Tween 20 ) . 
In total , each template hybridization experiment was done at least three times with different enzyme digestions and each hybridization was evaluated from at least three microarray grids .

PCR ampliﬁcation of 10 genes of S. typhimurium 
The hybridization was conducted at 90 8C for 1 min and subsequently at 50 8C for 60 min . 
The denatured samples were placed onto separate microchip areas containing oligoprobe microarrays and covered with a plastic cover slip to prevent evaporation during incubation . 
Shifting the temperature of the hybridization chamber from 90 to 50 8C 
The standard PCR mixture ( 50 ml ) contained 1 ! 
reaction buffer with 4 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM ( each ) deoxynucleotide triphosphate , 14 nM ( each ) primer , 50 ng of DNA template , and 2 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . 
A negative PCR ampliﬁcation control lacking DNA template was included with each experiment . 
PCR ampliﬁcation was conducted using the following conditions : initial enzyme activation at 94 8C for 2 min , 35 cycles at 94 8C 
was done gradually ( 5 min period ) . 
This gradual decrease in the temperature allows the labeled double stranded DNA of the templates to denature ﬁrst and then hybridize at lower temperatures to the oligoprobe increasing the possibility of hybridizing the complimentary strand to the chip . 
Each microchip slide contained 10 identical arrays enabling simul ¬ 
for 25 s , 40 -- 50 8C for 25 s , 72 8C for 30 s , and ﬁnal elongation at 72 8C for 5 min . 
Ampliﬁed DNA was visualized using gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1 ) . 
taneous analysis of ﬁve different DNA samples with each sample having two grids . 
After hybridization , the slides were rinsed with 4 ! 
SSC and washed twice with 2 ! 
SSC , 0.1 % SDS at hybridization temperature for 5 min . 
Afterwards , the slides were washed with 0.2 ! 
SSC and 0.1 ! 
SSC ( respectively ) at room temperature for 1 min . 
Finally , the slides were spun-dry

Microarray scanning and data analysis 
Fluorescent images of the microarray were generated by scanning the slides using a ScanArray 4000 equipped with two lasers with excitation wavelengths of 543 and 632 nm ( Perkin -- Elmer Life Science , Inc. , Boston , MA ) . 
The ﬂuorescent signals from each spot were measured and compared using QuantArray software ( Perkin -- Elmer Life Science , Inc. , Boston , MA ) . 
Analyses of collected data were performed on the basis of mean ﬂuorescent intensities measured for a ﬁxed circular area of each oligonucleotide spot . 
The ﬁnal results are presented as the percentage of normalized signal ( spot signal intensity of each spot subtracted by the average , negative control spots , and background signal intensity ) from each probe to the total signal from all array probes [ 6,12 ] . 
Signals with average relative intensity w0 .18 % or lower were found to be questionable since negative control of DNA sequence ranges between 0 and 0.18 % relative signal intensity . 
Some of the positive PCR ampliﬁcation of some genes and negative 
microarray chip hybridizations were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing ( Table 4 ) . 
3. Results
microarray chip hybridizations were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing ( Table 4 ) . 
3.1 . 
Conﬁdence in strains assignment 
The S. typhimurium isolates in this study were subjected to 20 biochemical tests ( API-20E test strip , bioMerieux , Inc. , l'Etoile , France ) and have been assigned to the Salmonella spp . 
based on the observed 21 biochemical patterns ( data not shown ) . 
In addition , the isolates investigated in this study have each been subjected to PFGE and have been compared to the FDA 's in-house PFGE database of over 1500 Salmonella isolates . 
The observed patterns for the isolates in this study were identical with PFGE proﬁles for S. typhimurium isolates . 
Only strains 9N and 422H were found to be closely related S. typhimurium strains ( data not shown ) . 
While errors can not be eliminated , the probability of misidentiﬁcation is low . 
3.2 . 
DNA microarray chip hybridization 
The genetic virulence gene content of 10 isolates of S. typhimurium was characterized by genomic hybridization to a microarray chip representing 71 virulence-associated genes . 
Overall , the virulence-associated 71 genes were found in six S. typhimurium strains ( 1129H , 3145H , 2706H , 422H , 620H , 9N ) and several genes were found to have weak signals in the rest of the four strains ( 1172H , 2200H , 2606H , 48N-DT104 ) . 
Table 3 shows the status of these questionable genes in order of their position in the investigated strains . 
The distributions of low signal intensity of the genes generally occurred in clusters and were strain speciﬁc . 
Strains 1172H , 2606H , 48N-DT104 and 2200H exhibited low signal intensities in 9 , 16 , 20 , and 23 genes ( respectively , Table 3 ) . 
Since the signal of each gene was measured from at least three different spots , digested wit 
two different enzymes ( Sau3AI and HinfIII ) , and at least three independent experiments were performed , the bias in the data was reduced . 
The PCR ampliﬁcation of the 10 genes in tested Salmonella strains ( 1129H , 3145H , 2706H , 422H , 620H , and 9N ) revealed complete matches with DNA chip hybridization . 
In the second group of Salmonella strains ( four strains : 1172H , 2200H , 2606H , 48N-DT104 ) , chip hybridization showed disagreement with the PCR data . 
This included the rmbA gene in 1172H , 2200H , and 2606H templates ; the misL gene in 48N-DT104 template ; the spi4F 
3.3 . 
Validation of measurements for chip hybridization by PCR 
We used PCR ampliﬁcation of 10 genes to measure the conﬁdence level of the chip hybridization . 
OrgA , ORF319 , ttrB , rmbA , misL , spi4F , spi4H , spi4N , 16s rRNA , and purR were selected for PCR ampliﬁcation to corroborate the DNA hybridization results ( Table 4 ) . 
These genes were selected randomly except the 16S rRNA and purR genes , which were considered positive controls . 
The goal was to use PCR ampliﬁcation to validate chip hybridization and investigate 
in 1172H , 2200H , 2606H , 48N-DT104 templates ; Spi4N in 2200H and 2606H templates ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . 
3.4 . 
DNA sequence analysis 
To determine the underlying molecular discrepancies between the chip hybridization data and PCR ampliﬁcation , DNA sequence analysis was performed on genes spi4N , rmbA , and misL ( Table 4 ) . 
The DNA analysis of spi4N gene sequences in 1172H , 2200H , 2606H , and 48N-DT10 templates revealed the absence of any mismatch . 
Similarly , the rmbA 
the conﬁdence level of the remaining genes arrayed on the chip . 
The ampliﬁcation of the 10 genes in all the tested strains were observed and documented by gel electrophoresis . 
Fig. 1 shows the ampliﬁed PCR fragments from 10 genes of all the S. typhimurium tested strains .

Only template 2606H oligoprobe was found to have one mismatch in the misL gene ( data not shown ) explaining that the absence of the chip hybridization signal is due to lack of hybridization ( Table 4 ) . 
any hybridization signal when labeling chromosomal DNA representing different genes ( data not shown ) [ 6,7,21 ] . 
Possible explanation of this is due to lower signal and diluted labeled probe . 
Oligoprobe microarray chip was redesigned by 
increasing the length of the oligoprobe sequence to at least 65 bp ( Table 2 ) . 
Ten out of 71 genes of the chip were selected to be ampliﬁed using PCR . 
Data collected from the ampliﬁcation were used to 
4. Discussion
conﬁrm the presence or absence of gene hybridization , and therefore , the data were used to corroborate the conﬁdence level and the reproducibility of DNA microarray hybridization . 
This allowed us to apply an empirical control on the DNA 
In our previous work [ 6 ] , reproducibility of the chip made and designed in our laboratory proved to be very robust . 
For example , a microarray-based method for characterization of six Clostridium perfringens toxin genes was developed and evaluated using 17 C. perfringens isolates . 
The presence of toxin genes in C. perfringens strains was established by hybridization and conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation . 
Furthermore , the C. perfringens genes were included in a secondgeneration chip called the FDA-1 microarray chip [ 21 ] . 
This chip was developed in a different laboratory ( but has the same oligoprobes ) for the simultaneous detection of several foodborne pathogens and their virulence factors including Listeria spp. , Campylobacter spp. , and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin genes . 
The C. perfringens chip , integrated in a larger chip , was tested in different laboratory and found to be reproducible . 
Ultimately , the FDA-1 chip was able to identify all the tested microorganism genes [ 21 ] . 
microarray data . 
As a result , our data indicated that when the DNA microarray hybridization of genes differed from PCR ampliﬁcation , further examination of the hybridization data showed weak signals with other genes , e.g. spi4E , pipA , yihT 
( Table 3 ) revealing an inability to differentiate from the background signal . 
However , when the PCR data supported and conﬁrmed the hybridization data , the rest of the microarray hybridized genes showed high signal intensities 
and reproducibility as a result of high conﬁdence level ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . 
The discrepancy between PCR ampliﬁcation data and chip hybridization data of the four strains indicates that the signal 
intensities of the chips are low compared to the background signal intensity and subsequently the four strains have a low conﬁdence level . 
The signal variability in the microarray data 
One of the main obstacles that we encountered during this work was the inability of the 22 bp oligoprobe chip to detect
