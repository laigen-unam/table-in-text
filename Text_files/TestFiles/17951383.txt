Upon contact with intestinal epithelial cells , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium injects a set of effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm via the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) type III secretion system ( T3SS ) to induce inﬂammatory diarrhea and bacterial uptake . 
The master SPI1 regulatory gene hilA is controlled directly by three AraC-like regulators : HilD , HilC , and RtsA . 
Previous work suggested a role for DsbA , a periplasmic disulﬁde bond oxidase , in SPI1 T3SS function . 
RtsA directly activates dsbA , and deletion of dsbA leads to loss of SPI1-dependent secretion . 
We have studied the dsbA phenotypes by monitoring expression of SPI1 regulatory , structural , and effector genes . 
Here we present evidence that loss of DsbA independently affects SPI1 regulation and SPI1 function . 
The dsbA-mediated feedback inhibition of SPI1 transcription is not due to defects in the SPI1 T3SS apparatus . 
Rather , the transcriptional response is dependent on both the ﬂagellar protein FliZ and the RcsCDB system , which also affects ﬂiZ transcription . 
Thus , the status of disulﬁde bonds in the periplasm affects expression of the SPI1 system indirectly via the ﬂagellar apparatus . 
RcsCDB can also affect SPI1 independently of FliZ . 
All regulation is through HilD , consistent with our current model for SPI1 regulation . 
Salmonella enterica serovars cause disease in humans ranging from mild gastroenteritis to lethal enteric fever ( 17 ) . 
Sal-monella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) encodes a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) that is an important virulence apparatus through which the pathogen injects effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of host epithelial cells . 
The resulting physiological response leads to the gastrointestinal symptoms of infection as well as cellular uptake of the bacteria that is necessary to initiate systemic disease ( 23 ) . 
Intricate regulation of SPI1 gene expression presumably restricts production of the T3SS to when the bacteria are in a speciﬁc location within the host and coordinates the assembly process of the secretion apparatus ( 20 , 38 ) . 
The master SPI1 regulatory gene hilA is controlled directly by three AraC-like regulators : HilD , HilC , and RtsA ( 19 , 53 , 58 ) . 
HilC and HilD are encoded in the SPI1 locus , while RtsA is encoded elsewhere in the chromosome in an operon with RtsB , which negatively regulates expression of ﬂhDC and therefore the entire ﬂagellar regulon ( 19 ) . 
HilC , HilD , and RtsA are each capable of activating expression of hilC , hilD , and rtsA , creating a complex regulatory loop that controls hilA expression ( Fig. 1 ) ( 15 ) . 
HilA directly activates transcription of the inv/spa and prg/org promoters on SPI1 ( 3 ) . 
Encoded in the inv operon , the AraC-like protein InvF can activate transcription of other genes located within and outside of the SPI1 locus , including sopB , encoding a secreted effector protein ( 24 ) . 
The expression of effector genes requires both InvF and the secretion chaper ¬

one SicA , which apparently coordinates transcription of effector protein genes with assembly of the SPI1 T3SS ( 12 ) . 
DsbA , a monomeric 21-kDa periplasmic protein , plays an important role in the folding of cell envelope proteins by catalyzing disulﬁde bond formation using a catalytic CXXC motif ( for a review , see reference 35 ) . 
After DsbA reacts with a target protein , it is reoxidized by the inner membrane protein DsbB , which then passes the electrons to quinones in the cytoplasmic membrane ( 4 ) . 
The Salmonella virulence plasmid-encoded SrgA is a DsbA paralog whose activity is also dependent on a functional DsbB ( 6 ) . 
DsbA is required for full virulence in a number of patho-genic organisms . 
For example , a functional DsbA is required for proper assembly of cholera toxin in Vibrio cholerae ( 54 ) , heat-stable toxin in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( 52 ) , and invasin in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ( 42 ) . 
DsbA has also been shown to be required for the proper function of the T3SS in Yersinia pestis ( 34 ) , Shigella ﬂexneri ( 64 ) , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 28 ) . 
SrgA or DsbA is also required for folding of SpiA , the outer membrane component of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) - encoded T3SS ( 48 ) . 
We previously provided evidence that DsbA is required for both SPI1-and SPI2-dependent type III secretion in Salmonella strains ( 18 ) . 
Mutations or treatments that interfere with disulﬁde bond formation in the periplasm are among the signals that activate the RcsCDB phosphorelay system , composed of the sensor RcsC , the response regulator RcsB , and the phosphotransfer protein RcsD ( YojN ) ( 45 ) . 
RcsB , alone or together with RcsA , either positively or negatively regulates transcription of target genes , including activating those for capsule synthesis and bio-ﬁlm formation ( 45 ) . 
An rcsC constitutive mutant exhibits decreased transcription of invasion genes including hilA , invF , sipC , and invG in a process that is RcsB dependent ( 50 ) . 
RcsCDB can also negatively regulate the ﬂagellar regulon ( 21 ) , which contains more than 60 genes grouped into three classes according to their transcriptional hierarchy ( 22 ) . 
Class I is composed of the ﬂhDC master operon , which encodes transcriptional activators essential for the expression of class II operons . 
The protein products of class II operons include the alternative sigma factor FliA , the anti-sigma factor FlgM , and those required for the structure and assembly of the ﬂagellar hook-basal body . 
Proper assembly of this structure allows the export of FlgM , freeing the FliA sigma factor to activate the class III operons ( 36 , 51 ) . 
The ﬂiA and ﬂgM genes are in separate operons , each of which is expressed from both class II and class III promoters ( 25 , 32 ) . 
FliZ is encoded in the ﬂiA operon and is reported to be an enhancer of class II ﬂagellar gene expression ( 31 ) . 
FliZ activates expression of hilA , one of the links between regulation of SPI1 and motility ( 33 , 44 ) . 
Our previous work suggested a role for DsbA in SPI1 T3SS assembly or function ( 18 ) . 
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , RtsA , HilD , and HilC directly activate dsbA and deletion of dsbA leads to loss of SPI1 function . 
Transcription of effector proteins was also signiﬁcantly decreased in the dsbA mutant background . 
These results led us to propose a model in which RtsA coordinates expression of SPI1 and DsbA , required for functional assembly of the SPI1 machinery . 
We proposed that loss of the machine caused feedback inhibition of effector gene expression . 
In this work , we present evidence that dsbA-mediated feedback inhibition is not simply through the SPI1 T3SS apparatus . 
Rather , we show that SPI1 responds to the disulﬁde bond status of the periplasm through the RcsCDB system and the ﬂagellar system as reﬂected in the level of FliZ ( Fig. 1 ) . 
These signals feed into the SPI1 regulatory network at HilD . 
We present further evidence that , independently of the regulatory effect , DsbA is required for assembly and/or function of the SPI1 apparatus .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Media , reagents , and enzymatic assays . 
Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium was used for routine growth of bacteria ( 46 ) . 
Motility agar contained 0.3 % Bacto agar , 1 % tryptone , and 0.5 % NaCl . 
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C , except for those containing the temperature-sensitive plasmids pCP20 and pKD46 ( 7 , 13 ) , which were grown at 30 °C . 
Antibiotics were used at the concentrations indicated : ampicillin , 100 g/ml ; chloramphenicol , 10 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 g/ml ; apra-mycin , 50 g/ml . 
Enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs and were used according to the manufacturers ' recommendations . 
Prim-ers were purchased from IDT Inc. - Galactosidase assays were performed using a microtiter plate assay as previously described ( 60 ) . 
For most of these assays , strains were cultured overnight in LB and then subcultured in LB medium containing 1 % NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and grown statically over-night . 
- Galactosidase activities were calculated as ( micromoles of o-nitrophenol formed per minute ) 106 / ( optical density at 600 nm milliliters of cell suspension ) . 
The values are means standard deviations , where n 4 . 
Bacterial strains . 
All bacterial strains are isogenic derivatives of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 and are listed in Table 1 . 
Deletions of various genes and concomitant insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette were constructed using Red-mediated recombination ( 13 , 65 ) as described previously ( 16 ) . 
The endpoints of each deletion are indicated in Table 1 . 
The appropriate insertion of the antibiotic resistance marker was veriﬁed by P22 linkage to known markers and/or PCR analysis . 
In each case , the constructs resulting from this procedure were moved into a wild-type background ( strain 14028 ) by P22 transduction . 
In some cases , antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed by using the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( 13 ) . 
All bacterial strains were rebuilt at least once , and experiments were repeated with the independent constructs . 
Plasmid construction . 
The pAH125 lacZ reporter system is a CRIM plasmid that confers kanamycin resistance ( 29 ) . 
The replacement of the kanamycin cassette with the apramycin cassette from a related plasmid , pAE2 ( W. W. Metcalf and A. C. Eliot , unpublished data ) , was accomplished using Red-mediated recombination ( 13 ) , creating plasmid pDX1 . 
The transcription start sites of hilA , invF , sicA , sopB , and prgH have all been mapped ( 12 , 43 , 57 ) . 
We ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned PhilA ( 4973 420 bp ) , PinvF ( 1533 202 bp ) , PsicA ( 2713 130 bp ) , P ( 3563 297 bp ) , and P sopB prgH ( 2653 116 bp ) upstream of the promoterless lacZ gene in pDX1 . 
The resulting constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequence analysis . 
These promoter-lacZ reporter plasmids were stably integrated in single copy on the Salmonella chromosome at the attB site using Int , thus creating single-copy transcriptional fusions without disrupting the native gene . 
PCR analysis was used to conﬁrm the presence of reporters in single copy . 
The hilA gene ( 273 1671 bp ) was ampliﬁed using primers carrying XbaI and SphI sites and Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) , digested , and cloned into the arabinose-inducible vector pBAD33 ( 27 ) to generate pHilA . 
The ﬂiZ gene ( 143 571 bp ) was ampliﬁed using primers carrying EcoRI and BamHI sites and then cloned into vector pWKS30 ( 63 ) . 
Western blot analysis of secreted proteins . 
Western blot detection of secreted SopB in pHilA background strains was performed after diluting overnight cultures 1/100 in 10 ml of LB medium without NaCl containing chloramphenicol and 0.01 % L-arabinose . 
These cultures were grown with shaking at 225 rpm on a platform shaker for 4 h at 37 °C . 
The hilA strains used for detection of SopB were grown statically overnight in LB containing 1 % NaCl . 
In either case , 10 ml of culture was centrifuged at 5,000 g . 
The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 200 l of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) . 
Fifteen microliters of 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) loading buffer ( 39 ) was added to 15 l of the suspension ( approx-8 imately 2 10 cells ) . 
This was considered the whole-cell extract . 
The original culture supernatant was centrifuged again and then ﬁlter sterilized using a 0.2-m-diameter syringe ﬁlter and concentrated to 1 ml using an Amicon-15 ﬁlter . 
Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 % by incubating them on ice for 30 min and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C . 
The supernatant was then removed , and the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed with 1 ml of ice-cold 95 % ethanol to which 100 l saturated sodium acetate and 50 l 0.2 % phenol red indicator were added . 
The samples were then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 g . 
This procedure was repeated until the solution was neutralized ( 66 ) .

washed a ﬁnal time in 95 % ethanol and allowed to air dry . 
The pellet was then resuspended in 15 l of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , and 15 l of 2 SDS loading buffer was added . 
Proteins in both the whole-cell extracts and supernatant samples were separated by electrophoresis in 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels ( 39 ) and blotted onto nitrocellulose ( BioTrace ; Pall Corporation ) using a Bio-Rad MiniProtean 3 electrophoresis system for 2 h at 300 mA . 
The blots were blocked with 5 % nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 . 
The primary antibody was rabbit anti-SopB antibody . 
The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G ( Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) and was detected using 1/10 ,000 ECL substrate and ECL Hyperﬁlm ( Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) . 
RESULTS
Loss of DsbA affects transcription of SPI1 genes . 
We previously showed that the SPI1 regulators RtsA , HilC , and HilD activate dsbA from a novel promoter in serovar Typhimurium and that DsbA is required for SPI1 secretion of effector proteins ( 18 ) . 
In the dsbA mutant , transcription of invF and genes downstream in the regulatory circuit was signiﬁcantly reduced . 
This led us to propose that misfolding of a machine component ( s ) in the dsbA mutant resulted in feedback regulation of SPI1 gene transcription . 
According to our original data , transcription of hilA was unaffected by a dsbA mutation . 
This observation suggested that the feedback regulation was acting between HilA and invF transcription . 
However , HilA is known to directly activate invF transcription ( 3 ) , and our current understanding of SPI1 regulation could not account for this result . 
To further determine where dsbA-mediated feedback regulation ﬁts into the regulatory scheme , we constructed hilA - , invF - , sicA - , prgH - , and sopB-lacZ transcriptional fusions and integrated the fusion constructs into the Salmonella chromosome in single copy at the attachment site . 
In contrast to strains used in our previous studies , the SPI1 locus is intact in these constructs . 
HilA directly activates invF ( and sicA vi readthrough ) and prgH , while InvF and SicA activate sicA and sopB . 
We measured - galactosidase activity from these fusions in both wild-type and dsbA backgrounds . 
Consistent with our previous data , deletion of dsbA signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of invF and sopB ( Fig. 2A ) . 
As expected , the dsbA mutation also reduced sicA expression in the same pattern as invF . 
However , in contrast to our previous results , loss of DsbA also affected the transcription of hilA . 
Consistent with the decreased expression of hilA , prgH transcription was also decreased in the dsbA mutation . 
To further clarify this discrepancy , we directly compared the activity produced from our original hilA-lacZ fusion at the chromosomal locus [ ( hilA-lac ) 112 ] compared to the newly constructed fusion integrated at the att site ( att : : pDX1 : : hilA - lacZ ) . 
- Galactosidase activity was determined after overnight growth of isogenic dsbA and dsbA mutant strains in LB with 2 mM DTT ( see below ) . 
As shown in Fig. 2B , only a low level of - galactosidase activity is produced from the original fusion . 
The level of activity was slightly decreased ( 2-fold ) in the dsbA mutant grown in the presence of DTT . 
In contrast , the - galactosidase expression from the newly constructed fusion was much higher and loss of dsbA caused a signiﬁcant ( 10-fold ) decrease in expression . 
The original hilA-lacZ fusion is a hilA null construct . 
To ensure that HilA was not required for the observed phenotype , we deleted hilA in the newly constructed fusion background . 
Consistent with recent reports ( 14 ) , deletion of hilA increased expression from the hilA promoter , but loss of DsbA led to a signiﬁcant decrease in this background . 
Thus , the low level of - galactosidase activity produced from our original fusion and the conditions ( see below ) under which we performed the experiment in our original report led us to conclude incorrectly that hilA transcription was unaffected in the dsbA background . 
Taken together , our current data conﬁrm that loss of DsbA leads to decreased transcription of the SPI1 genes but suggest that this potential feedback regulation feeds into the circuit upstream of HilA . 
SPI1 responds to the disulﬁde bond status in the periplasm . 
DsbA catalyzes disulﬁde bond formation in the periplasm and thereby facilitates protein folding . 
To better understand the signals giving rise to the SPI1 regulatory phenotype , we examined the effects of environment and the roles of additional periplasmic proteins that control disulﬁde bond formation or general protein folding . 
A phenotype similar to loss of DsbA could be achieved by the addition of 10 mM DTT to cell cultures ( data not shown ) , consistent with the hypothesis that loss of DsbA confers a phenotype due to a failure to form disulﬁde bonds . 
Indeed , the addition of 2 mM DTT to LB medium signiﬁcantly enhanced the dsbA phenotype while having only a minor effect on hilA transcription in a wild-type background ( data not shown ) . 
It is known that free cystine in rich media can partially compensate for loss of DsbA ( 4 ) . 
Based on these observations , we added 2 mM DTT to the cultures throughout our studies . 
We asked if SrgA , an additional periplasmic disulﬁde bond oxidase encoded on the Salmonella virulence plasmid ( 6 ) , also affected SPI1 . 
Deletion of srgA had no effect on expression of hilA or sopB , but a dsbA srgA double mutation had a stron-ger effect than the dsbA single mutation did ( Fig. 2C ) , suggesting that SrgA is additive to DsbA with respect to expression of SPI1 genes . 
The cytoplasmic membrane protein DsbB reoxidizes DsbA ( 4 ) , whereas DsbC is a periplasmic protein disulﬁde bond isomerase that can reshufﬂe disulﬁde bonds ( 56 ) . 
We tested whether these proteins also affected SPI1 regulation . 
In the presence of 2 mM DTT , deletion of dsbB decreased transcription of the hilA-lacZ fusion to approximately the same extent as seen in a dsbA mutant background , consistent with the known role of DsbB . 
In contrast , loss of DsbC led to a slight increase in hilA gene expression ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , initial formation of disulﬁde bonds is apparently more important than isomerization of preexisting disulﬁde bonds in the SPI1 phenotype . 
In E. coli , DsbA is primarily under the control of the two-component regulatory system CpxRA , which is activated by a variety of envelope stresses that cause protein misfolding in the periplasm ( 11 ) . 
In serovar Typhimurium , dsbA is controlled by the hilA regulators RtsA , HilD , and HilC , and expression of DsbA under SPI1-inducing conditions is independent of CpxRA ( 18 ) . 
We asked if the Cpx regulon had any role in the SPI1 phenotype conferred by loss of DsbA . 
As shown in Fig. 2D , deletion of CpxRA only slightly affected hilA expression . 
Moreover , the dsbA phenotype was evident in this background . 
These results are consistent with the expression of dsbA being independent of CpxRA under these conditions . 
Overproduc tion of OmpX , which can induce periplasmic stress by increasing activity of Sigma E ( 47 ) , also did not affect hilA expression ( data not shown ) . 
The lack of a signiﬁcant phenotype in the cpx mutant or under conditions that induce the Sigma E regulon suggests that the observed defect in the dsbA mutant is due directly to a lack of disulﬁde bond formation , rather than general protein misfolding in the periplasm . 
Feedback inhibition is not dependent on the SPI1 secretion machine . 
Our original hypothesis was that , in the absence of DsbA , the SPI1 apparatus was not assembled appropriately and this led to feedback inhibition at the transcriptional level ( 18 ) . 
If true , then mutations that disrupt the secretion machinery should confer a phenotype similar to that conferred by a dsbA deletion . 
It is not clear what , if any , defect in the secretion machinery is caused by loss of DsbA ( 48 ) . 
Therefore , we constructed a series of in-frame deletions removing genes encoding various parts of the needle complex , all of which are required for secretion by the SPI1 apparatus ( 23 , 37 ) . 
These included deletion of prgH through orgA , removing the inner membrane , periplasmic , and needle components of the apparatus ; deletion of invG , encoding the outer membrane secretin component of the machine ; deletion of invJ , whose homolog in the Shigella secretion apparatus , Spa32 , is a primary target of DsbA in that system ( 64 ) ; and deletion of invH , which encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein required for proper assembly of the InvG secretin ( 8 , 9 ) . 
All of these deletions conferred essentially identical phenotypes . 
The results for the invG de-letion are detailed below . 
The in-frame deletion of invG was introduced into strains containing hilA - , invF - , sicA - , or sopB-lacZ fusions . 
Deletion of invG had no signiﬁcant effect on the transcription of hilA and invF ( Fig. 3 ) . 
There was a slight decrease in sicA and sopB transcription in the invG mutant that could be due to SicAmediated secretion-dependent transcriptional regulation ( 12 ) . 
However , introduction of the dsbA mutation into the invG mutant background resulted in the expected decrease in expression of hilA , invF , sicA , and sopB . 
These results show that the feedback regulation conferred by loss of DsbA is not simply a result of either the physical absence or the dysfunction of the secretion machinery . 
The DsbA effect is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system . 
The inability to form disulﬁde bonds in the periplasm appears to activate the RcsCDB system ( 45 ) , which has been shown to repress expression of SPI1 ( 50 ) . 
Indeed , dsbA srgA double mutants are mucoid ( data not shown ) , indicating that capsule synthesis genes , controlled by RcsCDB , are being transcribed . 
We determined if the DsbA effect on SPI1 is mediated through the RcsCDB system . 
As shown in Fig. 4 , in the wildtype background , hilA expression was reduced 8-fold by loss of DsbA and 34-fold by loss of both DsbA and SrgA . 
Deletion of RcsBC caused an increase in hilA expression in an otherwise wild-type background . 
Moreover , in the rcsBC background , deletion of dsbA reduced hilA expression only 3-fold , while deletion of both dsbA and srgA showed a 15-fold reduction . 
These data suggest that the DsbA effect is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system but that additional factors also lead to decreased SPI1 expression in the dsbA mutant . 
The DsbA effect is partially dependent on FliZ . 
The interaction between the ﬂagellar and SPI1 secretion systems is complex ( see Discussion ) . 
An important link is FliZ , an enigmatic regulator expressed in an operon with ﬂiA , encoding the class III-speciﬁc sigma factor . 
Genetically , FliZ activates expression of hilA ( 33 , 44 ) and enhances class II ﬂagellar gene expression ( 40 ) . 
The DsbAB system is required for proper ﬂagellar assembly in Escherichia coli ( 10 ) . 
Figure 5 shows that loss of DsbA and SrgA in serovar Typhimurium leads to a severe motility defect . 
We reasoned that the loss of DsbA leads to defective assembly of the ﬂagellar apparatus and this could result in decreased expression of ﬂiZ and , consequently , decreased expression of hilA . 
This led us to test the role of FliZ in the DsbA effect . 
Deletion of ﬂiZ caused a slight motility phenotype ( Fig. 5 ) , consistent with its reported role in transcriptional activation of class II promoters ( 32 , 40 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 4 , the ﬂiZ deletion also reduced hilA expression 7-fold . 
However , in the absence of FliZ , hilA expression was reduced only 2-fold in the dsbA mutant or dsbA srgA double mutant . 
These data are highly reproducible and suggest that , like RcsCDB , FliZ is partially responsible for the DsbA effect on hilA expression . 
We then asked if these two systems account for the entire effect on hilA expression by deleting both rcsBC and ﬂiZ in the hilA-lac fusion strain . 
In the double deletion background , expression of hilA was no longer affected by loss of DsbA and SrgA ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Taken together , these results indicate that the DsbA effect on hilA expression is dependent on both the RcsCDB system and FliZ . 
The ﬂiZ gene is regulated in response to periplasmic disul-ﬁde bond status by both RcsCDB-dependent and - independent mechanisms . 
Although the data in Fig. 4 suggest that RcsCDB and FliZ independently affect SPI1 expression in the dsbA mutant , this interpretation is complicated by the fact that RcsB and cofactor RcsA can negatively regulate the ﬂagellar regulon ( including FliZ ) by binding directly to the ﬂhDC promoter region ( 21 ) . 
Indeed , the rcsBC mutation confers a phenotype in a motility assay , particularly if the cells are incubated for a relatively long time ( Fig. 5 ) . 
We wanted to determine whether the RcsCDB repression of SPI1 in the dsbA mutant is partially mediated by FliZ . 
As shown in Fig. 6A , we tested the effect of the dsbA mutation on expression of a ﬂiZ-lac fusion . 
Deletion of dsbA decreased ﬂiZ expression 13-fold . 
Deletion of rcsBC caused a slight increase in ﬂiZ transcription in the dsbA background and partially relieved the repression of ﬂiZ in the dsbA deletion background . 
However , a decrease in ﬂiZ transcription caused by deletion of dsbA was still observed in the rcsBC background . 
Thus , the regulatory effect on ﬂiZ is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system , but additional factors also lead to decreased ﬂiZ transcription in the dsbA mutant . 
Regulation of hilA mirrors regulation of ﬂiZ . 
What is the mechanism of decreased ﬂiZ transcription caused by loss of DsbA in the rcsBC background ? 
Based on published data , we propose the following model . 
The ﬂiAZ operon is controlled by both class II and class III promoters ( 40 ) . 
Loss of DsbA prevents proper assembly of the ﬂagellar apparatus , at least affecting FlgI assembly and stability ( 10 , 30 ) . 
Under these conditions , the anti-sigma factor FlgM should not be exported and should block class III transcription ( 36 , 51 ) and decrease FliZ expression . 
If true , then disabling the ﬂagellar apparatus should confer a phenotype similar to that conferred by a dsbA mutation . 
To test this model , we deleted ﬂgI . 
Figure 5 shows that , as expected , the ﬂgI mutant of serovar Typhimurium is completely nonmotile . 
To distinguish phenotypes resulting from the loss of the ﬂagellar apparatus from phenotypes resulting from other effects of dsbA , we speciﬁcally tested the effect of the ﬂgI mutation on expression of ﬂiZ-lacZ and hilA-lacZ fusions . 
De-letion of ﬂgI decreased both ﬂiZ and hilA expression , consistent with the above model , but not to the extent seen in the dsbA mutant ( Fig. 6B ) . 
Knocking out both dsbA and ﬂgI conferred a phenotype almost identical to that seen in the dsbA mutant . 
We then asked if this additional effect of the dsbA mutation was dependent on RcsCDB . 
As seen above , deletion of rcsBC caused an increase in ﬂiZ expression , presumably from the class II promoter . 
In the rcsBC background , however , the ﬂgI mutation had little effect on ﬂiZ - or hilA-lacZ transcription . 
This result suggests that the increase in ﬂiZ expression caused by loss of RcsCDB largely compensates for the decrease in expression caused by loss of the functional ﬂagellar apparatus . 
The data above suggest that , although loss of the ﬂagellar apparatus can affect FliZ expression , it does not explain th decrease in transcription observed in the rcsBC background when dsbA is also mutated . 
Indeed , deletion of dsbA in the ﬂgI rcsBC background led to a decrease in ﬂiZ expression , albeit 2-fold , and a slightly greater decrease in hilA transcription ( Fig. 6B ) . 
It seems unlikely that the loss of DsbA confers a defect in the ﬂagellar apparatus that is more severe than that conferred by deletion of ﬂgI ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Therefore , this result suggests that some regulatory circuit , in addition to RcsCDB , has a minor effect on expression of the ﬂagellar regulon in response to disulﬁde bond formation . 
Taken together , these results show that transcriptional regulation of ﬂiZ in response to disulﬁde bond status in the periplasm is multifactorial and complex . 
However , it is striking that hilA transcription closely mirrors ﬂiZ expression , suggesting that the DsbA effect on SPI1 is largely mediated through FliZ . 
DsbA can affect hilA expression independently of RcsCDB and the ﬂagellar system . 
Figure 6B shows that loss of DsbA led to a decrease in hilA expression in the ﬂgI rcsBC mutant background that was slightly greater than the decrease in ﬂiZ expression in this background . 
It is possible that DsbA can affect the SPI1 regulatory circuit independently of RcsBDC and FliZ . 
Note that this hypothesis is in apparent conﬂict with the results shown in Fig. 4 . 
In the rcsBC ﬂiZ mutant , loss of DsbA has no signiﬁcant effect on hilA expression . 
However , expression of hilA is low in this background and subtle effects on expression might be difﬁcult to discern . 
To test this idea , we introduced plasmid pWKS30 ( vector control ) and pFliZ into strains containing the hilA-lacZ fusion . 
In the latter plasmid , ﬂiZ is expressed from the lac promoter and should no longer be affected by DsbA . 
As shown in Fig. 6C , production of FliZ from the plasmid increased expression of hilA approximately 6.7-fold . 
In this background , loss of DsbA decreased the expression of hilA 2.5-fold ; expression was decreased 5.2-fold in the dsbA srgA double mutant . 
To test if this effect is solely dependent on RcsCDB , we tested the loss of dsbA srgA in an rcsBC strain containing the pFliZ plasmid . 
Under these conditions , loss of DsbA and SrgA still led to a modest , yet obvious , twofold decrease in expression . 
Quantitative PCR analysis showed that ﬂiZ mRNA production from the plasmid was identical in the dsbA and dsbA mutant strains ( data not shown ) . 
These results are consistent with those shown in Fig. 4 and show that the RcsCDB system can affect hilA expression independently of ﬂiZ expression . 
But these results also show that loss of DsbA and SrgA can slightly affect hilA expression independently of both FliZ and the RcsCDB system . 
FliZ and RcsCDB function through HilD . 
Our results prove that the transcriptional effect mediated by loss of DsbA is independent of the SPI1 secretion apparatus . 
It follows that loss of DsbA must be affecting hilA transcription via the known SPI1 regulatory system . 
We have recently shown that HilD , HilC , and RtsA act in a complex regulatory loop to control the transcription of the hilA gene . 
Moreover , in every case where it has been explicitly tested , all known regulatory systems that affect SPI1 regulation do so through HilD ( 15 , 20 ) . 
We asked if FliZ and RcsCDB also function through HilD to control SPI1 . 
First , we introduced pFliZ or the vector control ( pWKS30 ) into hilA-lacZ fusion strains in which the chromosomal ﬂiZ , hilD , hilC , or rtsA gene was deleted . 
As shown in Fig. 7A , production of FliZ from the plasmid was fully able to complement the effect of a ﬂiZ mutation on hilA expression and induced transcription of hilA ﬁvefold in an otherwise wildtype background . 
Introduction of a hilD deletion into the hilA-lacZ fusion strain resulted in the expected decrease in hilA expression . 
Moreover , the presence of a hilD mutation blocked FliZ induction of hilA . 
In contrast , neither RtsA nor HilC was required for FliZ induction of hilA expression , although the absolute level of expression was reduced in both mutant backgrounds , consistent with our model of SPI1 regulation ( 15 ) . 
Thus , FliZ-mediated induction of hilA expression is through HilD , while RtsA and HilC act as ampliﬁers of the signal . 
We then asked if the inhibition of hilA expression by RcsCDB also works through HilD . 
As shown in Fig. 7B ( and above ) , deletion of rcsBC in the wild-type background caused an increase in hilA expression . 
However , this effect was not evident in either the hilD or the ﬂiZ background . 
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the RcsCDB effect on hilA expression also works through HilD , at least partially by affecting expression of ﬂiZ . 
DsbA is required for function of the SPI1 secretion apparatus . 
Given that the DsbA effect is mediated through the SPI1 regulatory system and is apparently independent of the SPI1 T3SS apparatus itself , we considered the possibility that loss of DsbA has no effect on the apparatus per se but rather that th defect in SPI1-mediated secretion observed in a dsbA mutant is solely due to a decrease in the synthesis of the machine components . 
In order to test if loss of DsbA had a direct effect on the assembly or function of the apparatus , we contrived a situation in which the synthesis of the machine was independent of the normal signal transduction pathway . 
To accomplish this , we ﬁrst cloned hilA onto a pBAD vector under the control of an arabinose-dependent promoter . 
To avoid the problem of nonuniform induction inherent in the arabinose system ( 49 , 59 ) , we constructed a Salmonella strain that had deletions of arabinose transporters ( araE araFGH ) and catabolic genes ( araBAD ) and contained a plasmid encoding a mutant LacY ( A177C ) that transports arabinose proportionally to the external concentration ( 49 ) . 
Our background strain also contained a sopB-lac fusion integrated at the attachment site . 
We could then delete hilD to disconnect SPI1 gene expression from the regulatory effects of removing DsbA or any other known regulatory system . 
With the introduction of the pBADhilA plasmid , we titrated the arabinose concentration to achieve expression of the SPI1 system approximately equivalent to that observed in a wild-type strain under our normal inducing conditions , as monitored by expression of the sopB-lac fusion ( Fig. 8 ) . 
We monitored SPI1-mediated secretion by Western blotting , using antibodies directed against the SopB effector protein . 
In control experiments , we assayed the production and secretion of SopB from the wild-type strain , as well as dsbA , invG , and dsbA invG strains . 
As expected , deletion of dsbA in the wild-type background decreased production of SopB and the protein was not secreted into the culture supernatant at detectable levels ( Fig. 8A ) . 
The invG mutation completely blocked secretion of SopB into the supernatant while slightly affecting expression of SopB . 
In the pBAD-hilA background described above , SodB was expressed and secreted normally . 
Although there was some variability in the level of arabinose induction , deletion of hilD , as predicted , did not affect expression or secretion , given that hilA is controlled by arabinose . 
Deletion of dsbA in this background now had no effect on production of SopB in whole-cell extracts . 
However , secretion of SopB into the supernatant was signiﬁcantly decreased in the dsbA strain ( Fig. 8B ) . 
These data show that , independently of the transcriptional effect on the SPI1 regulatory circuit , loss of DsbA affects either the assembly or the function of the SPI1 secretion apparatus .

DISCUSSION
The inability to form disulﬁde bonds in the periplasm affects the assembly of complex machinery in the cell envelope . 
Indeed , loss of DsbA , the primary disulﬁde bond oxidase in the periplasm , has been shown to block type III secretion in sero-var Typhimurium , S. ﬂexneri , P. aeruginosa , and Y. pestis and motility in E. coli and serovar Typhimurium ( 10 , 18 , 28 , 34 , 48 , 64 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
But does loss of function indicate a simple defect in assembly ? 
Here we have shown that , in addition to a structural or functional defect conferred by mutations in dsbA , there is a distinct regulatory response . 
The SPI1 T3SS regulatory circuit responds to the state of disulﬁde bonds in the periplasm and adjusts expression of the machine components . 
Our results suggest that loss of DsbA affects SPI1 through four distinct yet overlapping pathways ( Fig. 1 ) . 
First , DsbA inhibits activation of the RcsCDB system ( 45 ) . 
Activation of RcsCDB in a dsbA mutant inhibits hilA expression ( 50 ) through HilD . 
Activated RcsCDB also represses ﬂhDC , encoding the master regulators of the ﬂagellar regulon ( 21 ) . 
This leads to decreased production of FliZ , which activates SPI1 ( 33 , 44 ) , also through HilD . 
Thus , under conditions where disulﬁde bonds are not properly formed in the periplasm , activation of RcsCDB leads to decreased production of at least two complex machines , the ﬂagellar apparatus and the SPI1 T3SS , that require assembly in the cell envelope . 
Second , DsbA is required for proper assembly of the ﬂagellar apparatus ; FlgI has been identiﬁed as at least one speciﬁc target ( 10 ) . 
In the absence of a functional ﬂagellar apparatus , the anti-sigma factor FlgM is not exported but rather binds the FliA sigma factor , preventing expression of class III ﬂagellar genes ( 36 , 51 ) . 
The ﬂiAZ operon is controlled by both class II and class III ﬂagellar promoters , and expression of this operon is signiﬁcantly decreased in both dsbA and ﬂgI mutant backgrounds . 
Thus , in the dsbA background , ﬂiZ expression from both the class II ( via RcsCDB ) and class III ( via FlgM ) promoters is decreased , resulting in decreased expression of the invasion genes . 
Third , loss of DsbA leads to a slight decrease in ﬂiZ expression independent of RcsCDB or the known ﬂagellar feedback regulation , but this pathway seems relatively minor 
We presume that this regulation is through ﬂhDC , which is subject to a variety of environmental inputs ( 55 ) . 
Fourth , loss of DsbA causes a slight decrease in SPI1 expression that is independent of RcsBCD or FliZ , but again this effect is minor . 
Indeed , our data point to FliZ as a primary link between expression of SPI1 and ﬂagella . 
A large number of regulatory systems and environmental signals have been implicated in SPI1 ( reviewed in reference 1 ) . 
The results presented here are consistent with our current model in which HilD , HilC , and RtsA act in a complex regulatory loop to control the transcription of the hilA gene ( 15 ) . 
Although in every case where it has been tested , the identiﬁed regulatory systems feed into SPI1 through HilD , the actual mechanism of regulation is understood in only a few instances and involves posttranslational blocking of HilD function ( 20 ) . 
Our data ( not shown ) suggest that FliZ also acts posttranslationally to affect HilD function . 
We do not mean to imply that FliZ is directly affecting HilD ; the actual mechanism will require further investigation . 
The ﬂhDC operon is also controlled by a number of other regulators including H-NS , cyclic AMP receptor protein , EnvZ/OmpR , QseBC , LrhA , and RcsCDB ( 55 ) . 
Given our data , it seems likely that some of the signals that affect regulation of SPI1 could function , at least partially , by affecting FliZ production . 
Similarly , RcsCDB responds to a number of stimuli , and it is not clear which of , and under what conditions , these various signals are most important ( reviewed in reference 45 ) . 
However , our data are consistent with disulﬁde bond status being an important physiological signal for RcsCDB . 
In conjunction with FliZ , RcsCDB could be the intermediate in the SPI1 response to a variety of environmental conditions . 
We have shown that , in addition to regulatory feedback on transcription , DsbA is required for appropriate assembly or function of SPI1 . 
However , the molecular requirement for DsbA is unclear . 
None of the protein components of puriﬁed SPI1 needle complexes contain more than one cysteine residue ( 37 , 39 ) . 
However , the mature InvH , which acts as the pilot protein for the secretin InvG ( 8 , 9 , 41 ) , does have two cysteine residues and is a likely candidate for the primary defect in the dsbA mutant . 
All indications are that , under the conditions that we are examining , dsbA is primarily controlled by RtsA , HilC , and HilD ( 18 ) ; CpxRA , which controls dsbA in E. coli , seems irrelevant to either expression of dsbA or assembly and function of the SPI1 T3SS or ﬂagella in serovar Typhimurium ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Thus , coregulation of dsbA with hilA apparently ensures that periplasmic disulﬁde bond formation is not an issue when SPI1 is being expressed and assembled . 
Our data suggest that FliZ plays a major role in the regulation of SPI1 in response to periplasmic disulﬁde bond status . 
However , this is only one aspect of the complex regulatory interaction between the ﬂagellar regulon and the invasion genes , and a number of regulators have been implicated in controlling both systems . 
RcsCDB negatively regulates both systems ( 21 , 50 ) . 
Likewise , FimZY , the regulator of type I ﬁmbriae , has also been shown to negatively coregulate ﬂagella and SPI1 ( 5 ) . 
HilA negatively regulates itself ( 14 ) , although the mechanism is not clear . 
A recent study suggests that HilA might also repress ﬂhDC ( 62 ) . 
In contrast , other systems differentially regulate the two machines . 
RtsA activates hilA , whereas the coregulated protein , RtsB , represses ﬂhDC ( 19 ) . 
SirA ( indirectly via the CsrABC system [ 2 ] ) also activates SPI1 but represses ﬂhDC ( 26 , 61 ) . 
It is not clear why this relationship exists between ﬂagellar and invasion systems , nor is it known under which natural conditions these various regulatory schemes become important . 
In particular , we do not know the state of these various regulatory networks during Salmonella colonization of the intestine when SPI1 expression is necessary . 
More studies are required to fully understand the physiological role of this complex relationship .
