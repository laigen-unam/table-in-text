ABSTRACT : The SpvB protein from Salmonella enterica was recently discovered as an actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin . 
SpvB is most likely delivered via a type-III secretion system into eukaryotic cells and does not have a binding/translocation component . 
This is in contrast to the family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins from various Bacillus and Clostridium species . 
However , there are homologies in amino acid sequences between the C-terminal domain of SpvB and the catalytic domains of the actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins such as C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum and iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens . 
We compared the biochemical properties of the catalytic C-terminal domain of SpvB ( C / SpvB ) with the enzyme components of C2 toxin and iota toxin . 
The specificity of C/SpvB concerning the modification of G - or F-actin was comparable to the C2 and iota toxins , although there were distinct differences regarding the recognition of actin isoforms . 
C/SpvB and iota toxin modify both muscle R-actin and nonmuscle â / γ-actin , whereas C2 toxin only modifies â / γ-actin . 
In contrast to the iota and C2 toxins , C/SpvB possessed no detectable glycohydrolase activity in the absence of a protein substrate . 
The maximal reaction rates were comparable for all toxins , whereas variable Km values for NAD were evident . 
We identified arginine-177 as the modification site for C/SpvB with the actin homologue protein Act88F from Drosophila . 
The intracellular acting pathogen Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes a variety of diseases , which range from gastroenteritis to typhoid fever in a broad host spectrum ( 1 , 2 ) . 
S. enterica harbors an extra chromosomal plasmid with a highly conserved gene cluster called spV ( salmonella plasmid Virulence ) . 
This gene locus is associated with intracellular bacterial growth and systemic infection ( 3 , 4 ) . 
It was shown that the infection efficiency is dramatically reduced when the spV genes are not expressed ( 5 ) . 
The spV gene cluster comprises five genes . 
The transcriptional activator spVR controls an operon consisting of four genes spVABCD ( 6-9 ) . 
Expression of the spV genes is upregulated after phagocytosis of Salmonella in response to the intracellular milieu ( 10 , 11 ) . 
Recently , the spVB gene product was identified as a mono ( ADP-ribosyl ) transferase , which modifies actin and thereby leads to depolymerization of actin filaments ( 12 , 13 ) . 
It is still not completely clear and controversially discussed how the actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin from S. enterica

( SpvB ) 1 protein is transported into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells . 
The function of the N-terminal part of SpvB ( Figure 1A ) , which has significant sequence similarity with the TcaC protein of Photorhabdus luminescens ( 12 ) , is not known . 
Thus , no binding/translocation component was identified , which delivers SpvB into the cytosol of cells . 
This suggests that SpvB is not a binary toxin like all known actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins produced by Bacillus and Clostridium species . 
The spV locus is located on the virulence plasmid , which is connected with the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 type-III secretion system ( 14 , 15 ) . 
Therefore , transport of SpvB into the host cell via the type-III secretion system ( TTSS ) was deemed likely by investigators . 
On the other hand , it was reported that that mimicking of the intracellular ion concentrations leads to a secretion of SpvB protein in a TTSS independent manner in Vitro and in ViVo ( 16 ) . 
Thus far , less is known about the biochemical properties of SpvB . 
The existing biochemical data are restricted to the effect on actin polymerization following ADP-ribosylation . 
The C-terminal domain of SpvB ( C/SpvB ) contains the catalytic site and shares sequence similarity with other actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins such as C2 toxin from Clostridium

botulinum and iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens ( 17 ) . 
An amino-acid-based alignment of the ADP-ribosyltrans-ferases C/SpvB , C2 toxin , and iota toxin is shown in Figure 1B . 
In particular , motifs that are essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity remain conserved within these toxins . 
The binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins have been studied in detail during the past years in our and other laboratories . 
A separated binding/translocation component mediates delivery of the enzyme component into the cytosol by pore formation in acidic endosomes ( 18 ) . 
Cellular chaperones facilitate the translocation of the enzyme components across endosomal membranes ( 19 ) . 
In this work , we performed a detailed biochemical analysis of the C/SpvB protein in comparison to the C2 and iota toxins . 
We show that there are differences in the enzymatic activities of the C/SpvB and clostridial toxins during the initial phase . 
Concerning the maximum ADP-ribosylation of actin and pH dependency , there are no significant differences between these proteins . 
We demonstrate that C/SpvB ADP-ribosylates â / γ-actin ( 13 ) as well as R-actin , which is comparable to iota toxin , but is in contrast to the C2 toxin that only modifies â / γ-actin . 
Furthermore , C2I has a 5-fold higher Km value for NAD than C/SpvB and iota a. Surprisingly , SpvB showed no NAD-glycohydrolase activity , although a poor activity for C2 toxin and a high activity for iota toxin is evident . 
Moreover , we identified arginine-177 in an actin homologue of a Drosophila indirect flight muscle protein as the modification site for C/SpvB .

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins . 
The proteins C. botulinum C2I and C. perfringens iota a were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 . 
Proteins were purified as described previously ( 20 , 21 ) and incubated with thrombin ( 3.25 NIH units/mL of bead suspension ) for cleavage of the GST domain . 
The C/SpvB protein represents the catalytic domain ( amino acid residues 375-591 ) of the full-length protein ( see Figure 1A ) and was purified following the protocol of Otto et al. ( 12 ) ; however , after IPTG induction , E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C and sterile filtration was not done . 
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electro-phoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) . 
SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli ( 22 ) . 
The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 . 
ADP-Ribosylation Assay . 
The ADP-ribosylation assay was performed ( 30 min , 37 °C ) with 6 µM â / γ-actin in HEPES buffer ( 50 mM , pH 7.4 ) , containing 2 mM MgCl , complete 2 protease inhibitor ( according to manual of the manufacturer ) , 200 µM [ adenylate-32P ] NAD , and 1 µM of each toxin C2I , iota a , or C/SpvB . 
The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C . 
Radiolabeled proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging . 
For ADP-ribosylation of G - / F-actin , the reaction was done with 60 nM toxins in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 , 0.2 mM CaCl2 , 0.2 mM ATP , and 0.5 mM DTT added with 6 mM KCl and 60 mM MgCl ) for 2 G-actin or in F buffer ( G buffer plus 1 mM ATP ) for F-actin . 
For further stabilization of F-actin , additionally , 120 µM phalloidin was supplemented to the reaction mixture . 
NAD-Glycohydrolase Assay . 
For detection of glycohydrolase activity , the recombinant toxins ( 1 µM each ) were incubated with 200 µM [ adenylate-32P ] NAD in 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) for 7 h at 37 °C . 
Aliquots of the reaction mixture were separated by thin-layer chromatography on TCL aluminum sheets ( Silica Gel 60 F254 ) with 66 % 2-propanol and 0.33 % ammonium sulfate and analyzed by phosphorimaging . 
In Vitro Translation and Separation of ADP-Ribosylated Act88F from Endogenous Actin . 
In this study , we used the Drosophila indirect flight muscle actin ( Act88F ) as a highly conserved homologue for full-length mammalian actin as described in other studies ( 23 ) . 
The phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) plasmid encoding the Drosophila indirect flight muscle Act88F protein ( wild type ) was kindly provided by Dr. John C. Sparrow ( York , U.K. ) . 
For in Vitro translation , the insert was cloned into a pET21a vector . 
The Act88F ( wt ) insert was amplified by PCR with Turbo Pfu DNA Polymerase ( Strat-agene , La Jolla , CA ) as described in the manual of the instructor with the primers 5 ′ - BamHI-Act88F ( CATGCCGGATCCACCATGTGTGACGATGATGCGGG ) and 3 ′ - Hin-dIII-Act88F ( CAGCGGAAGCTTTTAAAAGCATTTGCGGTGAACG ) . 
The amplification was done with 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s , primer annealing at 52 °C for 1 min , and extension at 72 °C for 2 min . 
The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and HindIII , ligated with BamHI/HindIII digested pET21a vector , and transformed into Epicurian XL cells from Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA ) . 
To prepare the Act ( R177Q ) mutant , a Quickchange mutagenesi of the Act88F ( wt ) plasmid was performed as described in the manual of the instructor , by using the primers 5 ′ - Act88Fwt/R117Q ( CCCACGCCATTCTGCAGCTGGAT-CTGGCTGG ) and 3 ′ - Act88Fwt/R177Q ( CCAGCCAGATC-CAGCTGCAGAATGGCGTGGG ) . 
The resulting plasmid was transformed into Epicurian XL cells from Stratagene . 
The in Vitro translation was performed at 30 °C for 90 min with the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System ( Promega , Mannheim , Germany ) as described in the manual of the instructor . 
For control of the translation efficiency , 1 µL of [ 35S ] - L-methionine ( Hartmann Analytic , Braunschweig , Germany ) was added and the translated protein was analyzed via SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging . 
In parallel , the in Vitro translation was performed without [ 35S ] - L-methionine . 
Subsequently , an ADP-ribosylation assay was performed in HEPES buffer ( 50 mM , pH 7.4 ) containing 2 mM MgCl2 , complete protease inhibitor , 100 µM [ adenylate-32P ] NAD , and 1 µM C2I or C/SpvB in a final volume of 500 µL for 60 min at 37 °C . 
A 400 µL solution of actin G buffer ( pH 7.0 ) was added , and the samples were incubated with 40 µL pre-equilibrated talon beads ( Metal Affinity Resin , Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) for 15 h at 4 °C to bind His-tagged Act88F to the beads . 
The beads were centrifuged ( 8000g for 3 min at 4 °C ) and washed 3 times with 800 µL of equilibration / washing buffer ( 50 mM Na PO , 300 mM NaCl , and 0.05 % 3 4 Triton X-100 at pH 7.0 ) . 
After further centrifugation , 40 µL of Laemmli buffer with DTT was added to the beads and the mixture was heated for 10 min at 95 °C . 
The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE , and radiolabeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging . 
All experiments were performed at least 3 times , and the results from representative experiments are shown in the figures . 
Values are given as mean ( standard deviation ( SD ) ( n g 3 ) . 
FIGURE 1 : Amino acid alignment of the actin-ADP-ribosyltrans-ferases C. botulinum C2I , C. perfringens iota a , and S. enterica SpvB . 
( A ) SpvB protein ( 65 kDa ) from S. enterica consists of 591 amino acid residues and represents an actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin . 
The C-terminal domain ( amino acid residues 375-591 , 24.5 kDa ) shares homology to other known ADP-ribosyltransferases and harbors the conserved amino acid residues , typical for ADP-ribosyltransferases ( R471 , S501 , T502 , S503 , E536 , and E538 ) . 
Between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the SpvB protein , a polyproline region ( amino acid residues 366-374 ) is located .

FIGURE 2 : Characterization of the recombinant proteins C/SpvB , C2I , and iota a . 
The purified recombinant toxins ( C/SpvB , 24.5 kDa ; C2I , 49.4 kDa ; iota a , 48 kDa ) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining ( A ) . 
The enzyme activities of the proteins were analyzed by in Vitro ADP-ribosylation of actin ( B ) . 
Actin ( 6 µM ) , [ 32P ] NAD ( 200 µM ) , and the respective toxin ( 1 µM of each toxin ) were incubated , and the radioactively labeled actin was detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography . 
RESULTS
Substrate Specificity of the Actin-ADP-Ribosylating Toxins C2I , Iota a , and C/SpVB . 
The recombinant proteins C/SpvB , C2I , and iota a were purified , and their correct molecular weights were confirmed by Coomassie staining following SDS-PAGE ( Figure 2A ) . 
The proteins were tested for their enzyme activities by in Vitro ADP-ribosylation of actin with the radioactive cosubstrate [ adenylate-32P ] NAD . 
The radioactive ADP-ribosylated actin was detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography ( Figure 2B ) . 
C2I , iota a , and C/SpvB all harbored ADP-ribosyltransferase activity , and the three enzymes comparably modified actin . 
Next , the substrate specificities of C/SpvB , C2 toxin , and iota toxin were compared according to the actin isoforms . 
Therefore , we used highly purified rabbit muscle R-actin and a nonmuscle â / γ-actin mixture from human platelets as substrates for ADP-ribosylation . 
Each of the three toxins ( 100 nM final concentration in the assay ) was incubated with 1 µM of either R-actin or â / γ-actin and with 200 µM [ adenylate-32P ] NAD . 
The amount of ADP-ribosylated actin differed dependent upon the actin isoform and toxin used as an enzyme . 
C2I , iota a , and C/SpvB all modified nonmuscle â / γ-actin to a comparable extent ( Figure 3A ) . 
In contrast , there were differences when muscle R-actin was used as a substrate ( Figure 3A ) . 
Muscle R-actin was not a substrate for C2I , whereas C/SpvB and iota a both modified R-actin to a comparable level of about 20 % in comparison to â / γ-actin . 
It was next tested whether the toxins could ADP-ribosylate G-actin and/or F-actin . 
For the enzyme assay , G or F buffer was used and , to stabilize the F-actin , phalloidin was added to the F buffer . 
C/SpvB weakly modified F-actin ( Figure 3B ) , whereas G-actin was a good substrate for ADP-ribosylation . 
Although the data demonstrate that C/SpvB , C2 toxin , and iota toxin prefer monomeric G-actin as a substrate , these toxins also marginally ADP-ribosylate F-actin . 
Kinetics of Toxin-Induced ADP-Ribosylation of Actin . 
To characterize the maximal modification of actin , the ADP-ribosylation of â / γ-actin was studied with an individual toxin 32 ( 50 nM ) and 150 µM [ adenylate-P PP ] NAD for 1-15 min . 
No significant differences between the toxins were observed for the maximal ADP-ribosylation of actin ( Figure 4A ) . 
However , at lower concentrations ( 1 nM iota a , 2.5 nM C2I , and 10 nM C/SpvB ) , it was obvious that kinetics during the linear phase of the reaction varied for each toxin . 
When the maximal velocities during the initial phase of ADP-ribosy-lation were compared , iota a exhibited the highest enzyme activity , followed by C2I and then the C/SpvB fragment . 
These results were confirmed by the actin modification level of each toxin ( Figure 4B ) . 
To study the cosubstrate dependency , we incubated increasing amounts of [ adenylate-32P ] NAD ( 0-20 µM ) with 6 µM actin and 10 nM C2I or C/SpvB or 5 nM iota a for 8 min at 37 °C . 
To determine the Km value for NAD , at least three independent experiments for each toxin were analyzed by using Lineweaver-Burk plots . 
Comparable Km values were detected for iota a ( 3.8 ( 0.2 µM ) and C/SpvB ( 4.4 ( 0.6 µM ) , while the C2I value was 21.3 ( 1.2 µM ( Table 1 ) . 
NAD-Glycohydrolase ActiVity of C2I , Iota a , and C/SpVB . 
The NAD-glycohydrolase activity of the individual toxins was clearly different . 
Iota a possessed a 36-fold increase in activity relative to the auto-hydrolysis of NAD after 7 h at 37 °C , while there was also a pronounced 6-fold increase i

NAD-glycohydrolase activity for C2I ( parts A and B of Figure 5 ) . 
In contrast , no significant NAD-glycohydrolase activity was detected for the C/SpvB protein . 
In parallel , we also tested the toxins for ADP-ribosylation of actin to confirm that the toxins , which had been included in the NAD-glycohydrolase assay , all harbored enzyme activity . 
Therefore , aliquots from the NAD-glycohydrolase assay solutions were removed after the 7 h incubation period and analyzed for ADP-ribosylation of actin as described above . 
Taken together , C/SpvB , C2I , and iota a ADP-ribosylated actin in a comparable manner ( data not shown ) . 
Influence of pH on ADP-Ribosylation of Actin by C2I , Iota a , and C/SpVB . 
The pH dependency of the enzyme activity was studied by in Vitro ADP-ribosylation of 20 nM toxin and 4 µM â / γ-actin . 
The enzyme activities for all toxins were tested at pH values of 4-10 ( Figure 5C ) . 
The pH optimum for C2I and C/SpvB was between pH 7-8 . 
A comparable enzyme activity for iota a was detected in a pH range from 6 to 10 . 
In contrast , decreased enzyme activities were measured for C2I and C/SpvB at pH values of 9 and 10 . 
When compared to C2I and iota a , the C/SpvB enzyme activity was more sensitive to low ( e6 ) and high ( g9 ) pH values . 
Arginine-177 Is the Modification Site for C/SpVB in the Recombinant Drosophila Actin Homologue Act88F . 
To identify the acceptor amino acid for ADP-ribosylation by a For determination of the Km values , actin ( 6 µM ) was ADP-ribosylated in the presence of 10 nM C/SpvB or C2I and 5 nM Iota a with increasing amounts of NAD ( 0-20 µM ) for 8 min at 37 °C . 
The data were analyzed by using Lineweaver-Burk plots ( n ) 3 ) . 
SpvB , we used the actin homologue Act88F , which is a Drosophila indirect flight muscle protein , as a substrate . 
The in Vitro translated proteins Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q were subjected to in Vitro ADP-ribosylation by C2I or C/SpvB . 
To verify the amount of the translated proteins Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q , we performed in parallel an in Vitro translation containing [ 35S ] - L-methionine and detected the translated radiolabeled proteins by autoradiography . 
Both proteins were translated in comparable amounts ( Figure 6A ) and subsequently used for ADP-ribosylation experiments . 
The nonradioactive proteins Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q were incubated with either C2I or C/SpvB in the presence of radioactive cosubstrate [ adenylate-32P ] NAD . 
The ADP-ribosylated Act88F proteins were detected by autoradiography ( Figure 6B ) . 
Both C2I and C/SpvB strongly ADP-ribosylated the Act88F wt protein , but only a marginal signal was detectable when the Act88F R177Q protein was used as a substrate for the toxins , indicating that arginine-17 represents the modification site for ADP-ribosylation by C2I and C/SpvB . 
FIGURE 3 : Substrate specificity of the actin-ADP-ribosyltransferases iota a , C2I , and C/SpvB . 
The substrate specificity concerning different actin isoforms for iota a , C2I , and C/SpvB is shown in A. For detection of actin isoform specific ADP-ribosylation , 1 µM of either R-actin or â / γ-actin was incubated with 100 nM of each toxin and 200 µM [ 32P ] NAD for 30 min at 37 °C . 
For ADP-ribosylation of G - or F-actin , the reaction was performed in G or F buffer containing 200 µM [ 32P ] NAD for 15 min at 37 °C ( B ) . 
For stabilization of F-actin , phalloidin was added to the F buffer . 
The final toxin concentrations in the assay were 60 nM . 
For each toxin , the rate of ADP-ribosylation for â / γ-actin ( A ) and G-actin ( B ) was set to 100 % . 
The values in A and B represent means ( SD of three independent measurements .

DISCUSSION
Various bacteria produce and secrete toxins , which attack eukaryotic cells by ADP-ribosylation of actin . 
This leads to a depolymerization of actin filaments and finally to a complete destruction of the cytoskeleton . 
Until recently , all known bacterial actin-ADP-ribosyltransferases revealed a binary form of organization consisting of two separate proteins , an enzyme component and a binding/translocation component . 
The family of clostridial actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins comprises the C. botulinum C2 toxin ( 24 ) and the iotalike toxins consisting of the C. perfringens iota toxin ( 25 ) , C. difficile CDT ( 26 , 27 ) , and C. spiroforme toxin ( 28 ) . 
Besides the clostridial toxins , there is the binary ADP-ribosyltransferase VIP ( vegetative insecticidal protein ) from Bacillus cereus . 
Recently , a new actin-ADP-ribosylating protein was identified in S. enterica . 
The SpvB protein is essential for the intracellular growth of Salmonella in macrophages and therefore for the pathogenic effects of this bacterium ( 14 , 29 , 30 ) . 
The catalytic site of SpvB shares homology to the clostridial actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and contains amino acid residues that are conserved within all arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases ( 12 ) . 
Interestingly , the N-terminal domain of SpvB does not share any homology to the enzymatic components of the known binary toxins . 
Moreover , no binding component was identified , thus leading to the conclusion that SpvB is not a binary toxin . 
It was supposed that SpvB is translocated by a type-III secretion system directly from the bacteria , which are located within cellular vesicles , into the cytosol of host cells ( 13 ) . 
To study whether SpvB is related to the C2 or iota-like toxins , with respect to ADP-ribosylation of actin , we analyzed the biochemical properties of the catalytic domain of SpvB ( C/SpvB ) and compared this enzyme with others like C2I from C. botulinum and iota a from C. perfringens . 
Moreover , we identified the modification site for SpvB as arginine-177 in the actin homologue Act88F protein from Drosophila . 
Until this study , the acceptor amino acid for ADP-ribosylation by SpvB was not identified by any group . 
Arginine-177 is the modification site for all actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins , which have been characterized by date . 
The C/SpvB protein consists of 217 amino acids and represents the catalytic domain of the full-length SpvB protein ( Figure 1A ) . 
It harbors a conserved EXE motif in its catalytic domain ( Figure 1B ) , which is conserved within the family of actin-ADP-ribosyltransferases and determines the acceptor amino acid specificity for arginine in other ADP-ribosyltransferases ( 12 ) . 
We used the actin homologue of Drosophila indirect flight muscle protein Act88F wt and the R177Q mutant to identify the modification site for C/SpvB . 
These proteins can be recombinantly expressed , and exchanges of amino acid residues are readily performed . 
To exclude the possibility that the exchange of R177Q in the Act88F protein leads to conformational changes , we per formed an in Vitro protease digest assay with Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q . 
The proteins were incubated with either trypsin or V8 protease , and the resulting digest patterns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining ( data not shown ) . 
No differences were observed between Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q , thus suggesting that significant conformational changes were not induced by residue exchange at arginine-177 . 
Moreover , Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q polymerized similarly under in Vitro conditions . 
This confirms a correct conformation for the Act88F R177Q protein ( data not shown ) . 
Either C/SpvB or C2I ( 23 ) modified Act88F . 
In contrast , only a marginal signal was detected for either toxin when the Act88F R177Q protein was used as a substrate . 
This result strongly suggests that Act88F is ADP-ribosylated at arginine-177 by SpvB . 
This specific arginine residue is the major modification site for SpvB , as it is for other binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins . 
The weak radioactive labeling of Act88F R177Q most likely results from remaining endogenous actin that was bound nonspecifically to the talon beads during the purification step of the Act88F R177Q protein from cell lysate . 
All known bacterial , actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins block the polymerization of actin , ultimately leading to a fatal collapse of the microfilament network . 
Thereby , the toxins turn G-actin into a capping protein that binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments and inhibit further polymerization ( 31 ) . 
For both C2I ( 24 ) and iota a ( 32 ) , G-actin is the major substrate , while polymerized F-actin is only poorly ADP-ribosylated . 
This agrees with our findings that C/SpvB also modifies G-actin with minimal alterations made upon F-actin . 
Most likely the remaining ADP-ribosylation of F-actin ( 10-20 % ) is due to the fact that nonpolymerized G-actin is still available under these assay conditions , thus resulting in a background signal for ADP-ribosylation of F-actin . 
Nonmuscle actin isoforms ( â and γ ) are the preferred substrates for the C2 and iota toxins ( 24 , 33 ) . 
However , only iota toxin has been described to modify also R-actin ( 32 ) . 
Concerning the modification of the actin isoforms , our data show that C/SpvB behaves like iota toxin . 
As described previously by Otto et al. ( 12 ) , we were not able to detect any NAD-glycohydrolase activity for C/SpvB . 
In contrast , iota a and C2I both possess significant NADase activities . 
As reported earlier by Nagahama et al. ( 34 ) , we also identified a similar Km value of 3.8 ( 0.2 µM for iota a , and in this current study , we discovered similar results for C/SpvB ( 4.4 ( 0.6 µM ) . 
These findings however are in contrast to earlier reports for C2I by Aktories et al. ( 35 ) , with a determined Km value of 21.3 ( 1.2 µM . 
This disagreement might be due to the fact that for the present work highly purified actin was used instead of cell lysate protein . 
In our hands , iota a and C2I exhibited ADP-ribosyltrans-ferase activity in a pH range from 5 to 10 . 
Iota a was active at higher pH values than C2I , and this was most likely linked to protein stability . 
C/SpvB exhibited significant activities at pH values from 6 to 9 . 
The enhanced sensitivity of C/SpvB to pH could be due to the fact that the recombinant C/SpvB protein represents only one domain of the full-length SpvB protein , and therefore , the C/SpvB protein could be more sensitive to unfolding by acidic pH when compared to the full-length versions of SpvB , C2I , and iota a. Taken altogether , C2I , iota a , and C/SpvB ADP-ribosylate actin that ultimately cause comparable ill effects upon the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells . 
C/SpvB shares arginine-177 as the modification site on the actin molecule with all known family members of the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins various Bacillus and Clostridium species . 
However , the toxins differ concerning specific biochemical properties ( for an overview , see Table 2 ) . 
FIGURE 6 : ADP-ribosylation of Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q by C2I and C/SpvB . 
Recombinant His-tagged Act88F proteins ( wt and R177Q ) were expressed using the in Vitro reticulocyte translation system . 
To control the translation efficiency for both Act88F proteins , the translation reaction was done in parallel with [ 35S ] - L-methionine . 
( A ) Radiolabeled Act88F proteins were detected by autoradiography . 
( B ) To test Act88F proteins as substrates for C2I and C/SpvB , in Vitro translated nonradioactive Act88F proteins ( wt and R177Q ) were used for ADP-ribosylation with radioactive [ 32P ] - NAD and the enzymes C2I and C/SpvB . 
Subsequently , His-tagged Act88F was purified from reticulocyte actin by affinity chroma-tography ( talon beads ) . 
The [ 32P ] - ADP-ribosylated Act88F wt and Act88F R177Q proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography , which is shown in B. 
FIGURE 5 : NAD-glycohydrolase activity and pH-dependent ADP-ribosylation of actin by C2I , iota a , and C/SpvB . 
For detection of glycohydrolase activity , the recombinant toxins were incubated with [ 32P ] NAD in 50 mM HEPES buffer at 37 °C for 7 h . 
The cleaved ADP-ribose moiety was separated form NAD by thin-layer chromatography ( A ) . 
The control lane without any toxin shows the low basal auto-hydrolysis of NAD . 
Quantification of the radiolabeled ADP-ribose is shown in B . 
The pH-dependent ADP-ribosylation ( pH values of 4-10 ) was measured with 4 µM â / γ-actin , 150 µM [ 32P ] NAD , and 20 nM of each individual toxin ( C ) . 
The maximal enzyme activity ( pH optimum ) for each toxin was set to 100 % . 
Values are means ( SD of three independent measurements .
