Abstract 
A gene encoding the resuscitation-promoting factor ( Rpf ) from Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 was cloned and characterized . 
The amino acid sequence encoded by S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf gene shares 24.2 % homology with Micrococcus luteus Rpf , which is secreted by growing cells , and required to resuscitate from viable but non-culturable ( VNC ) state . 
The S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf gene is 696 bp long , and shared a conserved segment with Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg ( 99.4 % ) . 
Recombinant Rpf ( rRpf ) proteins of S. Typhimurium LT2 after expression in E. coli BL21 harboring the pET15-b plasmid was approximately 25 kDa . 
Since S. Oranienburg cells are relatively quick to enter the VNC state just after incubating in the presence of 7 % NaCl at 37 - C for 3 days , we evaluated the biological effect of rRpf by using S. Oranienburg VNC cells . 
The rRpf not only promoted proliferation but also induced resuscitation of VNC cells to the culturable state in a dose-dependent manner . 
Therefore , rRpf may be useful for detection of bacterial contaminants present in the VNC form in food samples and the environment .

1. Introduction
Several food poisoning bacteria are known to enter into a viable but non-culturable ( VNC ) state in response to adverse environmental conditions , in which they do not longer grow on conventional media , but remain high viability and retain pathogenicity ( Roth et al. , 1988 ; Nilsson et al. , 1991 ; Rahman et al. , 1994 ; Stern et al. , 1994 ; Colwell et al. , 1996 ; Pommepuy et al. , 1996 ; Ravel et al. , 1995 ; Whitesides and Oliver , 1997 ) . 
For example , Vibrio cholera , Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella spp . 
enter into the VNC state in environments such as seawater , ground water , rivers and salted food ( Colwell et al. , 1985 ; Rollins and Colwell , 1986 ; Barcina et al. , 1997 ; Choa and Kim , 1999 ; Makino et al. , 2000 ;

From a food hygiene perspective , it often becomes a problem that contamination of such VNC cells in food may be overlooked under standard routine laboratory procedure , resulting in improper assessment of contaminated pathogens in food and environment . 
In 1999 , an outbreak across 46 prefectures of Japan , involving septicemia and gastroenteritis , resulted after consumption of dried processed squid contaminated with Salmo-nella enterica serovar Oranienburg ( Tsuji and Hamada , 1999 ; 
Saito et al. , 2000 ) . 
Since S. Oranienburg was detected in the environment of the processing plant as well as in waste floating around the import port , the raw squid was probably contaminated during the shipping and production process . 
In general , the preservation of food by salt followed by drying has been used widely as an effective means of preventing food-borne infections . 
We have found that Salmonella Oranineburg becomes non-culturable under osmotic stress , but retains its pathogenicity ( Asakura et al. , 2002 ) . 
Although a large body of evidence has been accumulated , little is known about genetic pathways underlying the VNC state . 
A number of in vitro methods have been evaluated for resuscitation of non-culturable bacteria . 
Resuscitation-promot-ing factor ( Rpf ) is a small protein , originally identified in Micrococcus luteus , which promotes recovery of bacteria from a VNC state to a vegetative state ( Kaprelyants et al. , 1996 ; Mukamolova et al. , 1998 ) . 
Purified M. luteus Rpf can stimulate growth and increase the recovery of M. luteus bacteria as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis from prolonged stationary growth cultures . 
Genes encoding Rpf-like proteins are widely distributed throughout the pathogenic bacteria such as myco-bacteria , corynebacteria , and streptomycetes ( Mukamolova et al. , 1998 ; Kell and Young , 2000 ; Hartmann et al. , 2004 ) . 
Because VNC S. Oranienburg cells can resuscitate and remain pathogenic under favorable conditions ( Asakura et al. , 2002 ) , which make them potential threats to the human health , it is of major importance to develop a new procedure for detection and isolation of them from food and environment samples . 
To this end , we surveyed resuscitation-related factors in the Salmonella genome database , and found that Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2 has an rpf-like gene with 24.2 % amino acid homology to M. luteus Rpf . 
We cloned and characterized this rpf-like gene using a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method , and evaluated its resuscitation effect on the VNC state of S. Oranienburg which has high homology of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences to S. Typhimurium LT2 and is easy to induce VNC state . 
The recombinant protein of rpf gene resuscitated the VNC cells of S. Oranienburg that were induced by osmotic stress , and its effect was dose-dependent . 
These results have significant implication for detection of microbial contamination in food .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and media
Bacterial strains used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 
S. Typhimurium strain LT2 was used for recombinant Rpf ( rRpf ) protein production . 
S. Oranienburg Sa99004 , isolated from a patient in an outbreak caused by dried processed squid , was used to produce VNC state ( Asakura et al. , 2002 ) . 
E. coli DH5 a and BL21 ( EDH3 ) were used as the non-expression host and the expression host , respectively . 
The liquid culture media included nutrient broth ( NB ; Difco Lab. , MI , USA ) lacking 
NaCl , brain heart infusion broth ( BHI ; Difco Lab . ) 
, trypticase soy broth ( TSB ; BBL/Becton Dickinson , MI , USA ) , and Luria broth ( LB ; BIO 101 , Inc. , CA , USA ) with/without 50 Ag/ml ampicillin . 
Agar plates were made from desoxycholate hydrogen sulfide lactose agar ( DHL ; Eiken , Tokyo , Japan ) , trypticase soy agar ( TSA ) , and LB by adding 1.5 % agar with / without 50 Ag/ml ampicillin . 
2.2 . 
Cloning of S. Typhimurium LT2 and S. Oranienburg rpf 
The complete sequence of S. typhimirium LT2 genome was determined ( McClelland et al. , 2001 , Genbank accession number : NC_003197 ) . 
By a BLAST search of the similar sequence to M. luteus rpf in the GenBank database , we have found that S. Typhimurium LT2 has a gene with 24.2 % homology . 
Based on this data , primers were designed to amplify the rpf-like gene to be used in PCR-based cloning for production of the rRpf protein . 
The upstream primer was 5V-CCCATATGCGAATTCTGGCTATCGATACC-3V , and the downstream primer was 5V-CCGGATCCTCATTCTTTGCC-GGGAAGTTTCTT-3V . 
The reaction mixtures were subjected to 1 cycle of 4 min at 94 - C , then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 - C , 30 s at 55 - C , and 30 s at 72 - C , followed by 1 cycle of 7 min at 72 - C. Ten reaction mixtures were pooled , and the PCR product was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit ( QIAGEN , MD , USA ) according to the supplier 's protocol and inserted into the TA TOPO cloning vector ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) . 
After successful cloning , the plasmid was extracted by QIA plasmid miniprep ( QIAGEN ) and the presence and orientation of the insert were determined by restriction analysis using restriction endonucleases BamHI and NdeI ( Takara , Shiga , Japan ) . 
The inserted sequences were analyzed by ABI PRISMS 310 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , CA , USA ) with M13 Forward and M13 Reverse primers . 
The BamHI and NdeI fragments were cloned into the pET-15b expression vector ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) and transformed into E. coli DH5 a ( DP ) . 
After plasmid extraction and determination of the in restriction enzyme digestion , the plasmid was transform E. coli BL21 ( BP ) for expression of the protein .

Expression and purification of histidine-tagged recombinant Rpf protein 
The BP were grown overnight in LB media supplemented with 50 Ag/ml ampicillin at 37 - C. Bacterial suspension ( 1 ml ) was added to 50 ml fresh LB supplemented with ampicillin ( 50 Ag/ml ) and incubated at 37 - C to an optical density value at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.6 . 
Gene expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-h-d-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG , Wako , Tokyo , Japan ) for 4 h ; during induction , cultures were shaken at 37 - C . 
The bacterial cultures were pelleted and processed for histidine-tagged protein purification according to the supplier 's protocol ( Ni -- NTA agarose , QIAGEN ) . 
After purification , the presence of the histidine-tagged protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and western blot with an anti-histidine-tagged Ab ( Amersham Biosciences KK , Tokyo , Japan )

2.4 . 
Determination of purified protein by SDS-PAGE and western blot 
SDS-PAGE was performed using a 12 % polyacrylamide separating gel and a 5 % stacking gel . 
Aliquots ( 80 Al ) of extracted rRpf protein were suspended in 20 Al of 5 sample buffer , heated for 5 min at 100 - C , and immediately chilled on ice . 
The samples were separated in an electrophoretic cell ( Mini Protean 3 ; Bio-Rad , CA , USA ) at a constant current ( 20 mA per gel ) for 1 h . 
The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Millipore , MA , USA ) in an electrophoretic semi-dry transfer cell ( Trans-Blot SD ; BioRad ) at 15 V for 1 h . 
After transfer was completed , the PVDF membranes were incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBS-T ) and 5 % skim milk to block nonspecific binding sites and washed three times with PBS-T . 
The membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with histidine-tagged ( Ag-1 ) monoclonal Ab ( clone 13/45/31 / 2 ; Oncogene , Biosciences Inc , CA , USA ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS-T containing 0.5 % skim milk and washed as described above . 
Thereafter , the membrane were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated F ( ab ' ) 2 fragment sheep anti-mouse IgG ( Amersham Biosciences ) diluted 1 : 5000 in PBS-T containing 0.5 % skim milk . 
The blots were washed in PBS-T and bound peroxidase enzyme was detected with the ECL-Plus western blotting detection reagent ( Amersham Biosciences ) . 
2.5. Antibody production and purification
To obtain anti-rRpf polyclonal Ab , we immunized Japanese White rabbits ( Charles River Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) four times at 2-week intervals by subcutaneous injection with 1 ml of a 50 % ( v/v ) mixture of rRpf ( 2 mg/ml in PBS ) and Freund_s adjuvant ( Sigma , MO , USA ) . 
Complete Freund 's adjuvant was used for the first immunization and incomplete Freund_s adjuvant for the subsequent immunization . 
Whole blood was collected at 2 days after the last immunization , and IgG was purified from serum by using a protein G-conjugated column ( MAbTrapi 
kit , Amersham Biosciences ) . 
2.6. Induction of S. Oranienburg VNC state
S. Oranienburg cells grown at 37 - C for 20 h in NB were washed three times with sterile normal saline . 
Approximately , 10 -- 10 cells were suspended in 100 ml of 7 % NaCl 9 10 solution and incubated at 37 - C for 3 -- 4 days . 
Everyday , a 0.1 ml aliquot of the suspension and its serial dilutions were spread on DHL and TSA plates to measure the CFU . 
To ensure the data were accurate , the experiment was repeated in duplicate . 
2.7. Determination of viability
S. Oranienburg cells in 7 % NaCl solution were stained by using the Live/Dead BacLight Bacterial Viability kit ( Molecular Probes , OR , USA ) . 
The stained bacteria were examined under fluorescence microscopy ( Olympus BX51 , OPELCO , VA , USA ) and the viability of 1000 cells was assessed . 
2.8. Resuscitation of VNC cells by purified rRpf protein
Bacterial cells in 7 % NaCl solution ( 1 ml ) which entered the VNC state were inoculated in 10 ml of 5 % BHI containing 10 Ag/ml of purified rRpf , followed by incubation for 7 days at 30 - C. To examine the effect of purified rRpf on resuscitation , 5 % BHI without purified rRpf was used as negative control and 5 % BHI enriched with 100 Al of filter-sterilized NB culture supernatant from an overnight culture of S. Oranienburg Sa99004 strain served as positive control ( Asakura et al. , 2002 ) . 
To determine the dose-dependency of rRpf protein , various concentrations of protein ( 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 and 10 Ag/ml ) were added to 5 % BHI , followed by the VNC cells ( 1 ml ) and incubated at 30 - C for 2 -- 3 days . 
The colony forming units was assessed on TSA to examine the dose-dependent effect . 
2.9. Inhibitory effect of anti-rRpf Ab on resuscitation
S. Oranienburg VNC cells ( 1 ml ) were inoculated into 10 ml of 5 % BHI containing rRpf at 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 Ag/ml . 
Then , rabbit anti-rRpf Ab ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 Ag/ml ) was added and resuscitation was monitored by bacterial growth and colony count on TSA during 7 days incubation at 30 - C. 
2.10. Growth enhancement by rRpf protein
Approximately , 10 -- 10 or > 10 cells of overnight culture 2 3 5 of S. Oranienburg , which were washed twice with sterile PBS by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 - C were added to 
10 ml of TSB , which supplement with rRpf protein at concentrations 0 , 1 , 5 and 10 Ag/ml . 
After incubation at 37 - C for 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 24 h , the OD600 of culture was measured to determine the enhancement ability of the rRpf protein . 
2.11. Nucleotide sequence accession number
The complete genome sequence of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 were accessed at GenBank databases as NC003197 ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide & val = 16763390 ) . 
The rpf gene sequence data of S. Typhimur-ium strain LT2 and S. Oranienburg have been submitted to the GenBank databases under accession number AY772265 and AY772266 , respectively . 
3. Results
3.1. S. Typhimurium LT2 rRpf protein production
A GenBank database search reveals that S. Typhimurium LT2 possessed a gene that shared significant nucleotide and amino acid similarity ( 44.8 % and 24.2 % , respectively ) with th 
M. luteus rpf gene ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Based on the sequence of this gene , primers were designed for PCR-based molecular cloning of the S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf-like gene , and determined the sequence of the PCR products . 
The S. Typhimurium rpf-like gene was 696 bp and has 99.4 % nucleotide and 99.6 % amino acid similarity with the homologous gene in S. Oranienburg ( Fig. 1 ) . 
To determine the biological role of rpf-like gene , we produced rRpf in E. coli expression system . 
Immunoblot analysis with anti-histidine-tagged Ab reveals that the molecular weight of rRpf was 25 kDa ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The rRpf protein was found only in BP , not in the host E. coli BL21 or the mock control ( Fig. 2 ) . 
This protein was stable after heat treatment at 55 - C for 15 min as determined by its resuscitation ability . 
However , its activity was lost when heated at 100 - C for 15 min ( data not shown ) .

The growth was determined by colony forming units of bacteria on TSA agar after overnight incubation at 37 - C ( > ) . 
Fluorescence staining by Live/Dead BacLight kit was used to assess the viability of the bacteria ( q ) . 
3.2 . 
Induction of S. Oranienburg VNC cells by osmotic stress 
When 10 -- 10 cells/ml of S. Oranienburg in the 7 8 stationary phase were cultured in 7 % NaCl at 37 - C , the culturable and viable cells were measured . 
The cultivability of the bacterial suspension was determined in each condition , tested by spread plate counting , and the cell viability was determined by the propidium iodide and SytoxGreen double staining . 
Before incubation in 7 % NaCl , the colony forming units ( CFU/ml ) of S. Oranienburg were approximately 1.45 10 . 
The culturability of S. Oranienburg drastically 9 dropped to 1.57 10 and 1.42 10 CFU/ml on days 1 and 5 3 2 post-incubation , respectively , and was completely lost after 3 days incubation ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Although , the CFU of S.

Dose-dependency of rRpf protein . 
One milliliter of the VNC cells of S. Oranienburg was added to 5 % BHI supplemented with 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 or 10 Ag/ml of rRpf protein , followed by incubation at 30 - C . 
After 2 days of incubation , the colony forming units was determined by plating on TSA agar . 
Oranienburg dramatically decreased , the viability only slowly declined and remained high after 3 days post-incubation , when no colonies appeared on TSA . 
The viability of S. Oranienburg before incubation in 7 % NaCl was approximately 92 % . 
The viable cells slightly decreased and remained as high as 84 % , 80 % and 76 % at days 1 , 2 and 3 post-incubation , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Thus , we concluded that 7 % NaCl forced S. Oranienburg to enter a VNC state by 3 days incubation . 
3.3 . 
Resuscitation of the VNC state by rRpf protein and dose-dependency 
Next , the resuscitation activity of rRpf was examined . 
The S. Oranienburg VNC cells were incubated at 30 - C for 7 days with various concentrations ( 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 and 10 Ag/ml ) of rRpf in BHI medium . 
While no colonies were formed on TSA plates when rRpf was not added , 1.42 10 , 5.18 10 , 1.63 10 , 2.72 10 and 4.94 10 8 8 9 9 9 CFU/ml of S. Oranienburg were recovered by the addition of rRpf at 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 and 10 Ag/ml , respectively . 
However , 1 ng/ml of rRpf no longer had any effect on resuscitation ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The rRpf protein resuscitated S.

One milliliter of the VNC cells of S. Oranienburg was added to 5 % BHI supplemented with 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 or 10 Ag/ml of rRpf protein , followed by incubation at 30 - C . 
After 2 days of incubation , the colony forming units was determined by plating on TSA agar .

3.4 . 
Inhibitory effect of anti-rRpf Ab on rRpf-dependent resuscitation 
VNC cells of S. Oranienburg in 7 % NaCl ( 1 ml ) were inoculated into 10 ml of 5 % BHI supplemented with rRpf at 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 Ag/ml in the presence or absence of rabbit anti-rRpf Ab ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 Ag/ml ) . 
The resuscitation was monitored by bacterial growth and colony count on TSA during 7 days incubation at 30 - C . 
The addition of rRpf to the culture recovered S. Oranienburg from the VNC state to the culturable state . 
However , the addition of various concentrations of anti-rRpf Ab together with rRpf abolished the resuscitation process induced by rRpf ( Fig. 5 ) . 
To inhibit rRpf-dependent resuscitation completely , more than half concentrations of Ab added to rRpf were required . 
3.5. Growth enhancement by rRpf protein
We also examined whether rRpf has a proliferation stimulating activity to S. Oranienburg . 
The results showed that rRpf could enhance the growth of S. Oranienburg cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 6A ) . 
However , when the inoculum was increased to > 10 cells , the rRpf did not show any 5 significant growth enhancement ( Fig. 6B ) . 
4. Discussion
Since its first description in 1985 , the VNC response has been observed in a number of bacteria ( Colwell et al. , 1985 ; Rollins and Colwell , 1986 ; Roth et al. , 1988 ; Nilsson et al. , 1991 ; Rahman et al. , 1994 ; Stern et al. , 1994 ; Colwell et al. , 1996 ; Pommepuy et al. , 1996 ; Ravel et al. , 1995 ; Barcina et al. , 1997 ; Whitesides and Oliver , 1997 ; Choa and Kim , 1999 ; Makino et al. , 2000 ; Mattick et al. , 2000 ; Santo Domingo et al. , 2000 ) . 
Food-borne bacteria in a VNC state have been of concern as a significant problem for food hygiene and public health . 
Although 
PCR has been widely applied to detect bacterial contamination in food , it only can tell us the presence or absence of bacterial DNA , not the state such as dead or dormant . 
So far , there are no simple methods for detection or recovery of VNC cells . 
We previously demonstrated that S. Oranienburg enters the VNC state following the exposure of osmotic stress , and the addition of mid-log phase S. Oranienburg culture supernatants can resuscitate the dormant cells ( Asakura et al. , 2002 ) , suggesting that viable bacteria secret a resuscitation-related molecule in a soluble form . 
In this study , we identified the gene encoding Rpf in S. Typhimurium LT2 and S. Oranienburg , and demonstrated that rRpf was able to resuscitate S. Oranienburg cells from VNC state in dose-dependent manner . 
We also have found a rpf-like gene in E. coli O157 : H7 , which has 76 % homology in amino acid sequence with S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf . 
However , S. Typhimurium LT2 rRpf protein showed no effect on resuscitation of E. coli O157 : H7 VNC cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that it may specific to S. Oranienburg or other Salmonella spp. , which share high homology in rpf gene sequence . 
Mukamolova et al. ( 1998 ) have shown that purified M. luteus Rpf can stimulate growth and increase recovery of M. luteus bacteria as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria from prolonged stationary cultures . 
We evaluated the growth stimulation effect by our rRpf . 
The rRpf could slightly enhance the growth of viable and culturable S. Oranienburg at low cell densities , but not at a high-density population . 
In addition to its ability in resuscitation of non-culturable cells , Rpf may work as a bacterial growth factor dependent on population density . 
However , the growth stimulation by Rpf appears to be only a minor effect . 
The molecular mechanism of how Rpf resuscitates dormant non-culturable cells is unknown . 
In our study , the addition of rabbit anti-Rpf Ab inhibited resuscitation effect by Rpf , suggesting the binding of Ab to Rpf block the ligand -- receptor interaction that triggers signaling of resuscitation process in VNC cells . 
Identification of the receptor for Rpf , the profiling the gene expression induced by Rpf stimulation , or analysis of rpf-null mutants , would help us to understand the underling mechanism for VNC and resuscitation processes in bacteria . 
Bacterial pathogens can contaminate foods at any point during production , processing , transport , retailing , storage or meal preparation . 
During these processes , some food-borne pathogens can survive in adverse environment by entering VNC status without losing their pathogenicity . 
The fact that S. Oranienburg colonies were detected and increased in number by the incubation with Rpf implies an underestimation of the real amount of active population by regular culturing methods . 
It will bring up a greater threat to microbial food safety and will need additional efforts in the development of new food inspection techniques . 
Our results suggest that it may be possible that rRpf can be used for the recovery and detection of

During 7 days incubation at 30 - C , the resuscitation inhibitory effect was determined by bacterial growth and plating on TSA .

Complete genome sequence of 
VNC bacteria contaminated in food samples and the environment . 
For example , addition of rRpf to regular culture media may substantially improve laboratory methods for the detection , isolation and cultivation of VNC pathogens . 
To confirm this , future works need to be performed . 
It can be applied as a simple , easy , non-special equipped method , and may decrease misdiagnosis of food inspection , and reduce the public risk to S. Oranienburg infection .
