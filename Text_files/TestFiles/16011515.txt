Activation of murine dendritic cells and macrophages induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
Summary macrophages and DCs . 
The expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules by macrophages and DCs was differentially regulated by interferon ( IFN ) - c and salmonellae . 
Live and heat-killed sal-monellae as well as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) inhibited the up-regulation of MHC class II expression induced by IFN-c on macrophages but not on DCs . 
Macrophages as well as DCs presented Salmonella-derived antigen to CD4 T cells , although DCs were much more efﬁcient than macrophages at stimulating CD4 T-cell cytokine release . 
Macrophages are effective in the uptake and killing of bacteria whilst DCs specialize in antigen presentation . 
This study showed that the viability of salmonellae was not essential for activation of APCs but , unlike live bacteria , prolonged contact with heat-killed bacteria was necessary to obtain maximal expression of

Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimu-rium ) can cause systemic salmonellosis in mice , a disease similar to typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica ser-ovar Typhi in humans . 
Protection against salmonellosis requires both innate and acquired immunity . 
Antigenpresenting cells ( APCs ) such as macrophages and dend-ritic cells ( DCs ) bridge innate and acquired immune responses by performing a variety of functions including phagocytosis , secretion of cytokines and antigen presentation . 
1 -- 3 
Macrophages are considered to be the principal cell type involved in the activation of the immune system by Salmonella , and this has been studied in depth . 
S. typhi-murium can invade murine macrophages and survive and multiply within them , and the macrophages respond 4 -- 6 by secreting a variety of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12 and chemokines such as macrophage inﬂammatory protein ( MIP ) -1 and MIP-2 . 
At the same time , Salmon-ella-activated macrophages produce oxygen-dependent antimicrobial molecules such as superoxide , hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide ( NO ) to inhibit or kill intracellular salmonellae . 
Changes in the expression of sur-7 -- 9 face molecules on peritoneal macrophages as a result of Salmonella infection have been described . 
Macrophages 10 also have the ability to process and present well-deﬁned T-cell epitopes expressed in Salmonella as fusion proteins , in the context of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I and class II molecules . 
11 -- 13 DCs can also take up Salmonella and present antigens to T cells . 
The speciﬁc role of these cells as APCs in 14 -- 19 Salmonella infection has recently been described . 
20,21 
Knowing that both macrophages and DCs play key roles in the induction of immune responses to Salmonella , the objectives of this study were to identify and compare phenotypic and functional changes that take place in macrophages and DCs once the cells encounter Salmon-ella in vitro . 
As DC preparations obtained from animals or grown in vitro from bone marrow may be contamin-ated by low levels of macrophages , we used both a macro-phage and a DC line to look at pure populations and then bone marrow-derived DCs ( BMDCs ) to study freshly derived DCs . 
As both live and heat-killed Salmonella vaccines are used in vivo , the inﬂuence of the viability of the bacteria in this interaction was also studied . 
Materials and methods
Mice
BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice 6 -- 10 weeks old were used in all experiments ( Charles River UK Ltd. , Margate , UK ) . 
Cell culture conditions 22
The dendritic cell line tsDC was cultured in Iscove 's modiﬁed Dulbecco 's medium ( IMDM ) supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 2 mm l-glutamine , penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 lg/ml ) and 50 lm b-mercaptoethanol for variable periods of time at 33 , 5 % CO . 
The J774A .1 macrophage-like cell line 23 2 was cultured in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , l-glutamine , penicillin and streptomycin as above at 37 , 5 % CO2 . 
Propagation of DCs from bone marrow
Femoral bone marrow cells were resuspended at 10 cells / 6 ml in RPMI-1640 with penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 lg/ml ) and 50 lm b-mercaptoethanol ( RPMI ) containing 5 % FCS . 
Supernatants containing murine granulocyte -- macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GMCSF ) and IL-4 ( a gift from Dr R. Bujdoso , Depart-24 25 ment of Clinical Veterinary Medicine , University of Cambridge , UK ) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 % . 
These cells were incubated at 37 , 5 % CO2 . 
Medium was replaced every 2 -- 3 days and cells were used between 6 and 8 days of culture . 
Cells used for analysis were CD11c and MHC class II positive . 
Bacteria and culture conditions
S. typhimurium strain SL3261 , an aroA mutant , was 26 grown overnight without shaking in Luria Bertani ( LB ) broth . 
Cultures were washed with tissue culture medium and the optical density ( OD600 ) of bacteria in tissue culture medium was used to estimate bacterial numbers . 
Bacteria were heat-killed by incubation at 70 for 30 min . 
Bacterial counts were performed on LB agar to conﬁrm bacterial numbers and killing . 
Stimulation of macrophages and DCs
DCs or macrophages were mixed with live bacteria for 2 hr , cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and then medium containing 15 lg/ml gentamicin was added and cells were incubated for a further 2 or 22 hr . 
With heat-killed bacteria and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 1 lg/ml S. typhimurium LPS ; Sigma , Poole , UK ) , cells were incubated continuously for 4 or 24 hr . 
Cells were stimulated with murine interferon ( IFN ) - c ( 50 U/ml ; R&D Systems Europe Ltd , Abingdon , UK ) for 24 hr at the same time as bacterial infection or LPS sti-mulation . 
All experiments were carried out in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates . 
Cell viability was assessed by counting with trypan blue at the end of incubations and by phase contrast microscopy . 
By trypan blue staining , viability was > 95 % with these culture conditions . 
Measurement of cytokine and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) induction
A total of 10 J774 macrophages or tsDC cells were stimula-5 ted as above in quadruplicate and the culture supernatants collected at 4 hr for TNF-a and 24 hr for IL-1b and nitrite measurement , and stored at ) 70 before use . 
Cytokine levels were determined using mouse TNF-a and IL-1b DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) systems ( R&D Systems Europe Ltd ) . 
The activity of iNOS in the cells was measured using the accumulation of nitrite by the Griess assay as described by Green et al. . 
Release of 27 cytokines was initially tested between 2 and 48 hr poststimulation with heat-killed bacteria and LPS . 
TNF-a release from cells began to plateau between 4 and 6 hr post-stimulation and so 4 hr was chosen as the time point to collect samples . 
Release of IL-1b was not detected before 24 hr post-stimulation but cell proliferation in control wells at 48 hr was noticeable and therefore 24 hr of incubation was chosen to collect samples for IL-1b detection . 
Detection of cell surface markers by ﬂow cytometry
Expression of cell surface markers was analysed on a FACS-Calibur ﬂow cytometer using CellQuest version 3 3 ( Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , Cowley , UK ) . 
Monoclonal antibodies against CD11c , CD80 , CD86 , CD40 and MHC class II and isotype-matched control antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen ( Cowley , UK ) . 
Phycoerythrin conjugated to streptavidin ( streptavidinPE ) was obtained from Serotec ( Kidlington , UK ) . 
J774 and DCs were stimulated for 24 hr as above or maintained in medium alone , then incubated with appropriate dilutions of monoclonal antibody for 40 min at 0 , and washed 3 times with PBA ( PBS with 0 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and 0 01 % sodium azide ) . 
Cells stained with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated antibody were kept on ice . 
Biotinylated anti-CD11c stained cells were then incubated with streptavidinPE for 20 min on ice and washed . 
Cells were ﬁxed with 2 % for-maldehyde before analysis . 
Expression of CD80 , CD86 , + CD40 and MHC class II on CD11c cells in BMDC cultures was analysed . 
Single marker staining on J774 and 
tsDC cell lines was analysed . 
Antigen presentation assay
The protein concentrations of heat-killed bacterial cultures were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay ( Bio-Rad , Hemel Hempstead , UK ) and the concentration adjusted to that required in complete medium ( RPMI with 10 % FCS ) . 
Irradiated ( 3000 cGy ) J774 macrophages ( 10 ) or irradiated BMDC ( 5 4 · 103 ) were used as APCs with heat-killed bacteria . 
A total of 10 CD4 splenic T 5 + cells from naıve or immunized ( infected with SL3261 3 -- 4 months previously ) mice which had been selected using CD4-MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec Ltd , Bisley , UK ) were plated with the above and incubated for 72 hr at 37 , 5 % CO2 . 
Supernatants were collected and stored at ) 70 until use . 
To show presentation of antigen by MHC class II , 2 lg/ml rat antimouse I-Ad ( clone M5 / 114-15 2 ) was included in cultures with 5 lg/ml heat-killed Salmonella with J774 or BMDC and CD4 T cells from immune mice . 
A rat isotype control was used in separate cultures . 
CTLL-2 bioassay
CTLL-2 ( ECACC no. 93042610 ) cells are an IL-2-depend-ent T-cell line that proliferates in response to IL-2 or IL-4 stimulation . 
They were routinely maintained in complete medium with 2 ng murine IL-2 / ml ( R&D Systems Europe Ltd ) . 
Before the bioassay , CTLL-2 cells were cultured overnight in RPMI with 2 % FCS without IL-2 at 1 -- 1 5 · 10 cells/ml . 
A total of 10 cells in complete medium were 6 4 cultured with supernatants from antigen presentation assays , medium or IL-2 ( 2 ng/ml ) for 24 hr at 37 in 5 % CO2 then labelled with H thymidine ( 1 lCi/well ; Amer-3 sham Biosciences , Chalfont , St Glies , UK ) for the last 16 -- 18 hr . 
Cells were harvested onto glass ﬁbre ﬁlter mats and counted on a Wallac 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter ( Perkin Elmer ( UK ) Ltd. , Beaconsﬁeld , UK ) to determine tritiated thymidine uptake by cells . 
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations except where stated otherwise . 
The two-tailed Student 's t-test was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance between two differentially treated cultures . 
Differences were considered signiﬁcant if P 0 05 . 
Results
Induction of cytokine secretion from macrophages and DCs by S. typhimurium
Both J774 and tsDC cells were infected by live S. typhi-murium within the 2-hr incubation period . 
There was a trend for J774 cells to internalize more bacteria than tsDC ( initial infection ratio 8 5 bacteria per cell ; intracellular bacterial numbers after 2 hr were 2 33 ± 0 21 per cell in J774 and 1 40 ± 0 53 per cell in tsDC ; P 1/4 0 08 ) . 
Despite this , after 24 hr J774 cells had cleared more of the internalized bacteria ( 0 15 ± 0 03 bacteria per cell ) than tsDC ( 0 41 ± 0 05 bacteria per cell remaining ; P < 0 01 ) . 
Macrophages and DCs secreted cytokines in response to incubation with live or heat-killed S. typhimurium . 
Induction of TNF-a secretion in both J774 and tsDC cells ( both cell lines with no other cellular contaminants ) was detected as early as 2 hr post-stimulation , but IL-1b secretion was not detected before 24 hr ( data not shown ) . 
To stop live bacteria from overgrowing in the culture , the initial inoculum was removed after 2 hr and extracellular bacteria were killed with a high concentration of gentamicin . 
After this was washed off , live extracellular bacteria were kept to very low numbers by the presence of low concentrations of gentamicin . 
Using this method , live bacteria stimulated cytokine production and up-regulation of surface markers on both macroph-ages and DCs ( see following ﬁgures ) . 
However , if heat-killed bacteria ( and similarly LPS ) were removed after 2 hr and replaced with medium , there were signiﬁcantly lower levels of TNF-a and IL-1b release ( Fig. 1 ) and surface marker up-regulation ( Table 1 ) than found for cells infected with live bacteria ( Fig. 1 ) or for cells sti-mulated with heat-killed bacteria for 24 hr ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) . 
Therefore , cells were continuously stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or LPS in the remainder of this study . 
Both heat-killed and live salmonellae induced TNF-a and IL-1b secretion ( at 4 and 24 hr , respectively ) from J774 macrophages and tsDC cells in a multiplicity of infection ( m.o.i. ) - dependent manner ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The highest levels of cytokines were seen with a m.o.i. of 5 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
A m.o.i. of 0 05 was not sufﬁcient to induce signiﬁcant amounts of cytokines with these culture conditions . 
LPS at 1 lg/ml gave maximal levels of cytokine release ( titration not shown ) and gave equal or greater levels of stimulation ( some variation from experiment to experiment ) compared with a m.o.i. of 5 with live or heat-killed bacteria ( Fig. 2 ) .

Five bacteria per cell gave similar levels of nitrite induction to 1 lg/ml LPS , but the lowest m.o.i. ( 0 05 ) was not sufﬁcient to induce any detectable nitrite in either cell type ( data not shown ) . 
Compared to heat-killed Salmonella , signiﬁcantly lower levels of nitrite were seen in cultures when live salmonellae were used ( Fig. 3b ) , showing that bacterial viability had an inﬂuence on the level of iNOS induction .

Changes in surface molecule expression on macrophages and DCs induced by Salmonella
To obtain maximum surface molecule expression , at least 24 hr of stimulation at 37 was necessary ( Table 1 ) . 
Sti-mulation of J774 macrophages or tsDC cells with live or heat-killed salmonellae at a m.o.i. of 5 resulted in the up-regulation of CD80 , CD86 and CD40 molecules after 24 hr ( Fig. 4 ) . 
To ensure that the results seen with tsDC cells were not a consequence of the properties of the immortalized cell line and to compare macrophages and DCs of the same inbred mouse strain , experiments were also carried out using BMDCs derived from BALB/c mice . 
were infected with live SL3261 Salmonella at a multiplicity of infection ( m.o.i. ) of 5 for 2 hr , washed and resuspended in gentamicincontaining medium for 22 hr . 
With heat-killed ( HK ) bacteria , cells were incubated continuously for 24 hr . 
Cells were washed and stained with isotype-matched ( untreated ; grey shading ) or speciﬁc anti-CD80 , CD86 or CD40 antibodies ( thin line , untreated ; thick line , HK ; dotted line , live ) . 
Isotype control antibody staining on cells stimulated with bacteria was slightly increased compared with unstimulated cells , but the geometric mean channel was always less than 7 ( unstimulated less than 4 ) . 
Where it is difﬁcult to see proﬁles of cells stimulated with live bacteria , the proﬁle lies very close to that of cells treated with HK bacteria .

As expected , stimulation with salmonellae induced the up-regulation of CD80 , CD86 , CD40 and MHC class II expression on BMDCs . 
Not only live and heat-killed sal-monellae but also LPS could up-regulate surface molecule expression . 
Maximal expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules on BMDCs was seen with 1 lg/ml or more of wild-type Salmonella LPS , which was compar-able to expression on cells stimulated with Salmonella at a m.o.i. of 5 ( Fig. 5 ) .

Stimulation with live or heat-killed Salmonella or LPS did not cause any up-regulation of MHC class II on these cells ( Figs 6e , i and k ) . 
In contrast , stimulation by Salmonella as above caused an increase in the number of BMDCs expressing high levels of MHC class II ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Since bacterial stimuli did not up-regulate MHC class II expression on macrophages , IFN-c , the major macro-phage-activating cytokine , was used . 
J774 cells incubated 30 with IFN-c expressed detectable levels of MHC class II ( Fig. 6b ) . 
The inﬂuence of stimulation by heat-killed or live Salmonella , or Salmonella LPS , on IFN-c-mediated MHC class II expression by J774 macrophages was examined . 
All three stimuli inhibited the IFN-c-induced up-regulation of class II molecules on J774 macrophages ( Figs 6f , j and l ) . 
BMDCs did not show increased MHC class II expression after exposure to IFN-c ( Fig. 6d ) and increased MHC class II expression on BMDCs produced by heat-killed Salmon-ella was not affected by IFN-c treatment ( Fig. 6h ) .

Presentation of Salmonella antigens by J774 macrophages and BMDCs
The ability of J774 macrophages and BMDCs to present antigens derived from Salmonella to CD4 T cells was tested . 
As the antigen preparations contained LPS , the T-cell response was measured by release of cytokines ( IL-2 and IL-4 ) using CTLL-2 cell proliferation in response to these cytokines as a read-out . 
This excludes B-cell proliferation , and T cells from naıve mice were used to control for non-speciﬁc responses . 
T cells from Salmonella-immunized mice showed augmented production of cytokines , proving the presence of Salmonella-speciﬁc T cells in immunized mice ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Both J774 macrophages and BMDCs presented Salmonella antigens on MHC class II to CD4 T cells . 
However , the level of cytokine secretion from T cells stimulated by J774 macro-phages as APCs was approximately 10-fold lower than that of T cells stimulated by BMDCs ( Fig. 7 ) .

Discussion
Dendritic cells activate naıve T cells , and so their role in priming immunological responses is now considered central . 
Macrophages play a pivotal role in combating 2 infectious microorganisms and mounting an immune response . 
This study shows the ability of both macro-1 phages and DCs to participate in the induction of immune responses against Salmonella as shown by cyto-kine secretion , induction of iNOS , modulation of surface molecule expression and antigen presentation . 
While activated macrophages are effective in direct removal or killing of the pathogens ( see ` Results ' above ) , DCs are sti-mulated to specialize in antigen presentation ( Figs 5 and 7 ) , effectively initiating the adaptive immune responses . 
As TNF-a and IL-1b are proinﬂammatory cytokines that induce DC maturation , induction of these cytokines in 31 response to Salmonella may facilitate DC activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissue to initiate an the CTLL-2 cell proliferation assay . 
Proliferation of the CTLL-2 cell line is expressed as the mean of incorporated H-thymidine for 3 quadruplicate samples . 
( a ) The open symbols show CD4 T cells from naıve mice and closed symbols show CD4 T cells from immunized mice . 
Squares and circles show J774 and BMDC antigen-presenting cells , respectively . 
CD4 T cells were always more than 90 % pure . 
A representative of three experiments is shown . 
A concentration of 12 5 lg/ml is the equivalent to a multiplicity of infection ( m.o.i. ) of approximately 4000 bacteria per cell . 
( b ) In one experiment using 5 lg protein/ml heat-killed Salmonella with J774 or BMDCs and l CD4 T cells from immune mice as above , 2 g/ml rat antimouse I-A ( clone M5/114 -15 2 ) ( + ) or a rat isotype control ( -- ) was inclu-d ded in cultures to show that presentation was by MHC class II to the CD4 T cells . 
adaptive immune response . 
Being DC maturation factors , these cytokines may also induce maturation of neighbouring DCs that only encounter soluble Salmonella antigens . 
DCs were infected by live Salmonella and there was a trend towards less efﬁcient uptake of bacteria by tsDC cells compared with macrophages . 
Despite this , the DCs did not clear the infection as well as macrophages . 
Inefﬁcient uptake of bacteria by DCs compared with macro-phages has been shown in other systems , including Salmonella abortus ovis infection of ovine monocyte-derived macrophages , DCs and afferent lymph DCs ( Dr S. Chan , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK , personal communication ) . 
Similar ﬁndings have been reported in comparing uptake of Escherichia coli by mu-rine BMDCs to that by murine peritoneal macrophages . 
32 Immature murine BMDCs are capable of phagocytosis of 33 microparticles , as are macrophages , so the above result may reﬂect reduced invasion of DCs in comparison with macrophages by Salmonella . 
We have shown here the induction of iNOS activity in both macrophages and tsDC cells . 
This is in contrast to data reported by Yrlid et al. , who suggested that iNOS 34 expression is not induced in DCs after interaction with Salmonella , either live or heat-killed . 
However , salmonellae express LPS molecules that are very similar to E. coli LPS molecules known to induce iNOS expression in BMDCs , and as such iNOS induction by heat-killed sus-35 pensions of Salmonella containing LPS would be expec-34 ted .

Presentation of Salmonella typhimurium antigen by macro-phages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) . 
A total of 10 J774 or 5 4 · 103 bone marrow dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) and 10 CD4 T cells were incubated 5 with different concentrations of heat-killed Salmonella or medium alone . 
After 72 hr , the supernatants were collected and stored at ) 80 . 
T-cell cytokine levels in supernatants were determined using 
46 hr of incubation before nitrite production was meas-ured . 
As we have shown above with cytokine induction and surface molecule expression , removal of the heat-killed bacteria after 2 hr results in suboptimal activation of both macrophages and DCs , and this may be the reason that Yrlid et al. saw no nitrite production from 34 DCs stimulated by heat-killed bacteria . 
iNOS expression results in the production of NO , which is an important antimicrobial molecule that may contribute to the killing of Salmonella in DCs . 
We showed here reduced levels of nitrite production by both macrophages and DCs infected by live Salmonella compared with those cells interacting with heat-killed bacteria ( Fig. 3 ) , and yet internalized bacteria in both macrophages and DCs were being killed ( see ` Results ' above ) . 
Lack of iNOS induction by live Salmon-ella can not be caused by removal of TNF-a at 2 hr after infection , as we showed that there were good levels of TNF-a 2 hr later at 4 hr post-infection . 
Lack of an effect-ive iNOS response by J774 macrophages to S. typhimu-rium infection has been documented previously ( Dr M. 36 
Jones , Institute for Animal Health , Compton , UK , perso-nal communication ) and Svensson et al. showed there is 16 no NO production by BMDCs infected with live Salmon-ella . 
There is also evidence that NO production by DCs in response to Salmonella infection decreases with increasing bacterial load and percentage of cells infected in the culture . 
Live Salmonella is known to interfere with the 37 localization of iNOS , and different products of live Sal-38 monella can interfere with NO superoxide products . 
39 This may provide a selective advantage for some strains of bacteria ( Dr M. Jones , personal communication ) . 
Therefore , the lack of production of NO by cells infected by live bacteria is not unexpected . 
The data presented here show that Salmonella or Salmonella LPS was capable of inducing up-regulation of CD80 , CD86 and CD40 expression on macrophages and DCs . 
Modulation of MHC and costimulatory molecule expression on DCs upon stimulation with bacteria , bacterial components such as LPS and CpG DNA ( cytidine-phosphate-guano-sine DNA ) and virus dsRNA has been reported . 
Con-40 -- 42 tradictory results have been published on CD80 expression on DCs after bacterial stimuli . 
Some reports showed a requirement for bacterial viability and longer incubation periods to obtain CD80 up-regulation , whilst others found increased CD80 expression with killed bacteria and within 24 hr of incubation . 
Some 16,29,43 -- 45 authors showed increased expression of CD40 after interaction of macrophages with Salmonella , whilst others 46 showed only increased CD86 expression . 
These different 16 results may be attributable to cell source and/or experimental protocols ; however , it is evident that both macro-phages and DCs can up-regulate costimulatory molecule expression , which will aid activation of T cells . 
Live or heat-killed Salmonella and LPS induced the up-regulation of MHC class II molecules on BMDCs . 
In contrast , the same stimuli did not induce up-regulation of MHC class II on J774 macrophages , but instead inhibited the IFN-c-induced up-regulation of MHC class II expression . 
A number of reports have obtained similar ﬁndings with different types of macrophages , and other bacteria and bacterial products . 
The 19-kDa lipopro-47 -- 51 tein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibits MHC class II expression and antigen processing by macrophages . 
The 52 mechanism of inhibition by LPS is mediated by NO. 48 Up-regulation of MHC class II was not seen on DCs in response to IFN-c . 
A similar ﬁnding has been described previously . 
However , both DCs and macrophages could 53 present bacterial antigen to speciﬁc T cells ( Fig. 7 ) . 
DCs were more efﬁcient than macrophages . 
The lack of MHC class II expression on J774 macrophages at the start of T-cell stimulation assays may contribute to the weak T-cell stimulation seen with these cells . 
MHC class II expression on the macrophages must be induced in the cultures upon interaction with the T cells to allow presentation to occur . 
In another report where DCs and macro-phages were compared , only DCs could present Salmonella antigen to speciﬁc T cells . 
Inhibition of 46 IFN-c-induced class II expression combined with the decreased potency of J774 macrophages compared to BMDCs in antigen presentation assays may reﬂect an immune evasion mechanism by Salmonella , allowing it to survive within macrophages during chronic infections in vivo . 
In this study , bioactive IL-12p70 secretion was not detected from J774 or tsDC cells stimulated with Salmon-ella or Salmonella LPS . 
Previous studies with Salmonella stimulation of macrophages and DCs have shown minimal induction of IL-12p70 secretion compared with IL-12p40 . 
Similarly , Chlamydia-stimulated murine 10,54,55 DCs produce IL-12p40 but no IL-12p70 . 
There are two 56 pathways that induce IL-12 production by DCs . 
One is a direct response to microbial infections , probably signalled through Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pathogen recognition receptors that cause rapid IL-12 production . 
57 
The second pathway is triggered by MHC class II and CD40 engagement such as happens during antigen pres-entation to T cells . 
It is possible that the Salmonella 58 -- 60 strains or LPS used here did not induce IL-12p70 under the given culture conditions but that the presence of T cells is also required . 
Here , viability of Salmonella was not essential for activation of , or antigen presentation by , APCs in vitro . 
However , when heat-killed Salmonella was incubated with tsDC cells or BMDCs for 2 hr , and the cells were washed and placed in fresh medium , it was seen that the 2 hr of exposure to bacteria induced lower levels of surface mole-cule expression 22 hr later ( Table 1 and data not shown ) . 
Similarly , cytokine secretion was markedly reduced ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This implies a need for continuous ( > 2 hr ) sti-mulation for good activation of the cells with heat-killed bacteria . 
This supports the conclusion that live Salmonella is superior to heat-killed bacteria as a vaccine . 
The 21,61,62 lower efﬁcacy of heat-killed bacteria may be caused by their inability to spread in the body and/or a short dur-ation of stimulation of cells . 
Five to 10 times more heat-killed bacteria are needed to achieve similar levels of association with phagocytic cells in the spleen after intra-peritoneal injection . 
Heat-killed Salmonella may be 21 degraded by phagocytes before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs , whereas phagosomes containing live 63

Salmonella diverge from the degradative pathway of macro-phages . 
In DCs , Salmonella-containing vacuoles also 64 diverge from the endosome-lysosome pathway . 
In this 17 way , live bacteria remain inside cells in vesicle-bound compartments ( reviewed in ref . ) . 
There is evidence for 65 66,67 the presence of TLRs in intracellular vesicles , so live bacteria may continue to signal through TLRs by continuous secretion of immunostimulatory molecules such as LPS . 
Degradation of killed bacteria will stop signalling in cells after the initial encounter with the antigen . 
However , DCs loaded with heat-killed Salmonella do prime CD4 and CD8 Salmonella-speciﬁc T cells upon transfer + + into naıve hosts . 
Similarly , DCs pulsed with heat-killed 21 Chlamydia and Bordetella pertussis not only induce 56 68 T-cell activation but also induce good protection against their respective infections . 
In summary , both live and killed Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium activate APCs , but the data presen-ted here show that there are differences in the time needed for live and killed bacteria to stimulate responses and in some of the actual responses themselves . 
There are also differences in some of the responses between macro-phages and DCs . 
This may reﬂect different roles of these APCs in the immune system and also the effect of infection by Salmonella or its products on the cells .
