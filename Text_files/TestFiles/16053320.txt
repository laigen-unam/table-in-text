Detection of Salmonella pp. Using Micro er-O s
Salmonella spp . 
are one of the most problematic food pathogens in public health , as they are responsible for food poisoning associated with contamination of meat , poultry , and eggs . 
Thus , rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella spp . 
is required to ensure food safety . 
In this study , a fiber-optic DNA microarray using microsphere-immobilized oligonucleotide probes specific for the Sal-monella invA and spvB genes was developed for detection of Salmonella spp . 
Microarrays were prepared by randomly distributing DNA probe-functionalized microspheres ( 3.1 - µm diameter ) into microwells created by etching optical fiber bundles . 
Hybridization of the probefunctionalized microspheres to target DNA from Salmo-nella was performed and visualized using Cy3-labeled secondary probes in a sandwich-type assay format . 
In this study , 103-104 cfu/mL of the target organism could be detected after 1-h hybridization without any additional amplification . 
The DNA microarray showed no crossreactivity with other common food pathogens , including E. coli and Y. enterocolitica , and could even detect Salmonella spp . 
from cocktails of bacterial strains with only moderate loss of sensitivity due to nonspecific binding . 
This work suggests that fiber-optic DNA micro-arrays can be used for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella spp . 
Since fiber-optic microarrays can be prepared with different probes , this approach could also enable the simultaneous detection of multiple food patho-gens . 
Foodborne pathogens are important targets for the control of food safety and public health . 
It is estimated that foodborne pathogen-related diseases cause approximately 70 million illnesses and 5000 deaths each year in the United States alone.1-3 In addition , food safety testing and healthcare costs resulting from 1 foodborne diseases total nearly 10 billion dollars . 
Salmonella spp . 
are one of the most problematic food pathogens , as Salmonella is recognized to be the causative agent for salmonellosis , which is responsible for more than half of the reported cases of foodborne diseases .4 Most salmonellosis cases are associated with foods of animal origin , including meat , poultry , and dairy foods .

Salmonella serotypes are considered potentially pathogenic , the development of a rapid and reliable detection method for Salmo-nella spp . 
with simple sample preparation is critical . 
Conventionally , culture-based methods have been used for identification of Salmonella , but they are labor-intensive and timeconsuming , requiring 3-6 days to yield results .5,6 Lack of timely reporting may delay control and prevention of outbreaks . 
Although alternative detection methods including immunological assays such as immunoblotting or ELISA,7-9 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - based assays,10-12 electrochemical assays ,13,14 and arraybased biosensors15 ,16 have been developed to overcome these drawbacks , these methods are not always adequate because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity . 
Many electrochemical methods and biosensors are based on immunological techniques , which are often limited by cross-reactivity of the antibodies . 
Since the 1990s , PCR-based assays utilizing primer sequences specifically designed for target organisms have been employed for pathogen detection . 
PCR is especially useful for low-concentration targets including those in food or environmental samples . 
PCR products are traditionally detected by electrophoresis on agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining of DNA . 
While this method is simple , it lacks sensitivity . 
Alternative methods including TaqMan real-time PCR , dot-blot , and Southern-blot hybridizations have been developed . 
These new methods provide higher sensitivity but are time-consuming .17 For example , TaqMan realtime PCR techniques provide improved sensitivity and selectivity by employing hybridization of two primers and a labeled internal probe to the target sequence to prevent nonspecific amplification . 
While these methods quantify the amplified target during PCR

by simply monitoring the fluorescence signal , they still require 1-2 h to perform.18-20 Microarrays have gained favor as platforms for high-content analysis during the past decade . 
DNA-based microarrays using species-specific probes have shown great potential for clinical applications including diagnostics and gene expression monitoring ; 21,22 however , the fabrication of cost-effective array devices remains a challenge . 
Currently , DNA-based microarrays , also called `` DNA chips '' , are fabricated by immobilizing single-stranded nucleic acid probes onto solid substrates such as glass , nylon , or silicon , using techniques including photolithography ,23,24 inkjet dispensing ,25,26 or pin-based fluid transfer .27,28 While these techniques are able to generate high-density microarrays , they employ labor-intensive fabrication steps and require the design and fabrication of a new platform every time the probe sequences are modified . 
Alternatively , DNA arrays can be prepared by assembling probe-functionalized microspheres into an array.29-32 Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that fiber-optic arrays prepared in this manner have many advantages over other microarray platforms , including higher sensor-packing density , smaller assay sample volumes , increased sensor reus-ability , and greater sensitivity.32-35 In this paper , we describe detection of Salmonella spp . 
using microsphere-based DNA microarrays that combine the advantages of the fiber-optic platform with the specificity of molecular probes . 
The DNA fiber-optic microarrays were prepared by loading oligonucleotide probe-functionalized microspheres into microwells created by selectively etching the distal end of optical fiber bundles .32 A sandwich-type assay was performed in which target DNA samples were hybridized to the capture probes attached to the microspheres , followed by labeling through a second hybrid-ization with Cy3-conjugated signal probes . 
The resulting Cy3 fluorescence signals from all the probe-functionalized microspheres were observed simultaneously using a charge-coupled device ( CCD ) camera .

All reagents were used without further purification . 
All bacterial strains used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. Worobo 's laboratory in the Food Science and Technology Department at Cornell University . 
Microsphere Encoding . 
Internal encoding of microspheres was carried out using a modified version of the previously reported 32 procedure . 
Aliquots ( 50 µL ) of 3.1 - µm-diameter amine-modified poly ( methylstyrene ) - divinylbenzene microspheres were washed three times each with 150 µL of PBS ( 1 × , pH 7.4 ) and with 150 µL of THF . 
A 150-µL aliquot of Eu-dye in THF ( 0.1 or 0.5 M ) was added to the microspheres , and the mixture was shaken for 2 h at room temperature . 
The mixture was vortexed every 15 min to avoid clumping of microspheres . 
Encoded microspheres were recovered after centrifugation ( 10 000 rpm , 5 min ) and washed thoroughly with MeOH and 1 × PBS . 
The encoded microspheres were stored in 0.01 % Tween 20 in PBS at 4 °C until use .

cgi ) or ArrayDesigner 2.0 software ( Premier Biosoft International , Palo Alto , CA ) . 
All probes designed were searched against GenBank to confirm their gene specificity . 
Cyanuric Chloride Activation of Oligonucleotide Probes . 
DNA probes were activated using a slight modification of a previously published protocol .32,33 DNA probes with a 5 ′ - amino-C6 modifier were dissolved in sterile , DNA-free water to a final concentration of 100 µM . 
A 250-µL aliquot ( 25 nmol ) of DNA was activated by the addition of 40 µL of 50 mM cyanuric chloride in acetonitrile . 
The mixture was shaken for 2 h at room temperature , and activated DNA probes were separated from unreacted cyanuric chloride by centrifugal ultrafiltration .

An aliquot of encoded microsphere solution ( 10 µL ) was washed with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) , and 200 µL of 8 % ( v/v ) glutaraldehyde in 1 × PBS with 0.01 % ( v/v ) Tween 20 ( PBST ) was added to the beads . 
The mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature . 
The microspheres were washed three times with PBST , and 200 µL of 5 % ( v/v ) PEI in PBS was added to the beads . 
The mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature , and the microspheres were rinsed with PBST followed by SBB . 
An aliquot ( 100 µL ) of cyanuric chloride-activated DNA was added to the functionalized microspheres , and the mixture was shaken overnight at room temperature . 
The beads were then rinsed with SBB three times . 
To prevent nonspecific binding , the remaining free amine groups on the beads were blocked with 100 µL of `` capping solution '' ( 0.1 M succinic anhydride in 90 % DMSO , 10 % SBB ) by shaking for 1 h at room temperature . 
The beads were washed three times with SBB , three times with TE buffer containing 0.1 % NaCl and 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and then stored at 4 °C prior to use . 
Microarray Fabrication . 
Optical fiber bundles ( 500-µm diameter ) containing ∼ 6000 individual 3-µm-diameter optical fibers were sequentially polished with 30 - , 12 - , 9 - , 3 - , 1 - , and 0.3 - µm lapping films on a fiber polisher ( Ultra-tec Mfg , Inc. , Santa Ana , CA ) . 
Polished fiber bundles were sonicated in water for 10 s to remove residue on the polished end . 
The distal end of the polished fiber bundle was chemically etched to form microwells as described previously .33 Etched fibers were thoroughly rinsed with water . 
A DNA microarray was prepared by loading 0.5 µL of each single probe bead suspension for a single bead type array or a mixture of the different bead solutions for a multiplexed array onto the distal end of the etched fiber bundle .

DNA from bacterial samples for hybridization were prepared from the above-mentioned cultures by two different methods . 
In the first method , bacterial cultures were heated at 90 °C for 5 min to release chromosomal DNA from the bacterial cells . 
The heattreated culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min , and the supernatant was treated with RNase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) at 37 °C for 15 min to avoid nonspecific hybridization from RNA in the samples . 
The RNase-treated samples were heated at 90 °C for 5 min to denature double-stranded DNA and then cooled on ice before being used for hybridization . 
In the second method , DNA was purified from the bacterial cultures using a Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . 
A mock sample was prepared by artificially contaminating culture broth . 
Sterilized TSB ( 50 mL ) was left in the open environment for 12 h at room temperature to catch any organisms in the environment . 
Following environmental exposure , TSB culture was grown overnight at 37 °C and spiked with Escherichia coli culture ( ATCC 25922 , 104 cfu/mL ) . 
This mock sample was additionally spiked with different concentration of Salmonella enteritidis culture and used for the assay . 
Sandwich Hybridization Assay . 
Sandwich hybridization was performed by exposing the microarray to target samples ( 200 µL ) composed of chromosomal DNA from bacterial cell cultures in 5 × PBS . 
Various concentrations of target samples , from 103 to 108 cfu/mL , were prepared by serial dilution . 
After incubation for 40 min , the array was washed twice with prewarmed TE containing 2 % SDS ( 40 °C ) . 
Following the wash steps , three fluorescence images were acquired with 150-ms camera exposure time , and their average values and standard deviations were calculated as background . 
The array was then exposed to the solution containing 1 µM signal probes ( 200 µL ) for 20 min and washed with prewarmed TE containing 2 % SDS ( 40 °C ) . 
After washing , three fluorescence images were recorded ; their average values and standard deviations were calculated as the hybridization signal . 
A positive hybridization signal was defined as any net signal ( hybridization signal - background ) greater than 3 times the standard deviation of the background intensity . 
The arrays were prepared for reuse by washing with dehybridization buffer of 90 % formamide solution in 1 × PBS heated to 85 °C until the fluorescence returned to background levels . 
All hybridizations were performed at room temperature . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of DNA probes . 
To evaluate the use of DNA microarrays for detecting Salmonella spp. , oligonucleotide probes a Signal in a bracket is considered as nondetectable by the definition of positive signal which is greater than 3 times the standard deviation of the background . 
The standard deviation of the background was 18 and the threshold limit for a positive signal was calculated to be 54 ( ) 3 × 18 ) . 
were designed to target the bacterial virulence genes : invA , invE , spvB , and agf . 
Sequence information for the probes is shown in Table 1 . 
These genes were chosen because they have demonstrated high specificity for detection of Salmonella spp . 
in previous studies.37-40 Additionally , these genes are useful for identifying highly pathogenic Salmonella serotypes , as they are essential for pathogenesis . 
For each target gene except invA , a capture probe and signal probe pair were designed . 
For the invA gene , two capture probes were used . 
Five types of DNA probe-functionalized microspheres , InvA1 , InvA2 , InvE , SpvB , and Agf , were prepared by attaching amino-terminated oligonucleotides of each respective capture probe sequence to glutaraldehyde-activated microspheres . 
The performance of each DNA probe type was first tested using a single bead type microarray by measuring the signal from hybridization with Cy3-labeled synthetic targets that had complementary sequences to the capture probes . 
Hybridization was performed using 100 µL of synthetic target solution at three different concentrations : 10 nM , 10 pM , and 100 fM . 
Various hybridization times were used depending on the target concentration ; 5 , 20 , and 30 min were used for synthetic target solutions of 10 nM , 10 pM , and 100 fM , respectively . 
Table 2 shows net signal intensities for each probe type . 
Net signal intensities were obtained by subtracting the averaged background signal intensity from the averaged hybridization signal intensity ( averages of the replicate beads in the array ) . 
All probes except InvE gave a positive signal within 30 min of exposure to 100 fM target solution , which demonstrates the feasibility of their use for sensitive detection . 
At lower target concentration ( 10 fM ) , only InvA and SpvB probes gave positive signals ( data not shown ) . 
The lower sensitivity of the InvE probe was likely due to the nonideal characteristics of the capture probe sequence , which included low melting temperature ( T ) , self-complementarity , and m low stability , as determined from the information provided by the probe sequence design software . 
Due to this low sensitivity , the InvE probe was omitted from further study . 
Notably , the longer probes ( invA-CP1 , 31 mer ; spvB-CP , 35 mer ) generally gave higher

signals than the shorter probes ( invE-CP , 21-mer ; agf-CP , 20-mer ) , which is in agreement with the previous report by Relogio et al. who found that oligonucleotide length influenced the intensity of fluorescent signals .41 Optimization of Sandwich Hybridization . 
DNA-DNA or RNA-DNA sandwich hybridizations have become commonly used techniques in diagnostics and detection assays over the past two decades.42-45 Since two hybridization steps are performed in a single sandwich hybridization assay ( a primary hybridization between the capture probe and the target DNA and a secondary hybridization between the target DNA and the signal probe ) , it was necessary to optimize each step 's hybridization time . 
We determined the optimal capture probe 's and signal probe 's hybridization times by varying the incubation time for each step from 1 to 60 min . 
To optimize the primary capture probe hybridization time , a target sample was prepared by heat treatment as described above from a culture of S. enteritidis ( 1 × 108 cfu/mL ) . 
An InvA2 probe array containing ∼ 100 probe microspheres was initially used as a representative microarray instead of using a multiplexed array to facilitate data analysis . 
First , the primary hybridization times were varied while the secondary signal probe hybridization time was held constant at 10 min ( Figure 1A ) . 
Signal intensity increased with longer primary hybridization time and reached a plateau after 30 min . 
This result suggested that the DNA probes were fully hybridized after a relatively short incubation time ( < 1 h ) and eliminated the need for a longer hybridization time as long as targets were present in high concentrations . 
It is likely that lower concentration targets would require longer times to fully hybridize ; thus , we selected 40 min as a compromise time for the hybridization between capture probes and target DNA . 
To optimize the secondary hybridization time , we employed a 40-min primary hybridization time and varied the secondary hybridization time . 
As shown in Figure 1B , signal intensity increased dramatically with increased secondary hybridization time and reached a plateau after 30 min , an indication of complete hybridization . 
There are two possible explanations for the rapid saturation of target sequence by the signal probe . 
First , a high concentration of signal probe ( 1 µM ) was used for hybridization . 
Our previous study using synthetic targets showed that probe beads became saturated with target molecules within 5 min and reached the signal plateau when high concentrations of targets ( g100 nM ) were used .23 Even though the target used in the present study is chromosomal DNA , it is likely that the high signal probe concentration helps produce a positive signal with a relatively short hybridization time . 
Second , target-signal probe hybridization would be expected to experience less interference than target-capture probe hybridization because probe-specific hybridization between the targets and capture probes may be obstructed by the presence of interfering proteins or other impurities in the target solution . 
The large size of nontarget DNA a Signal in a bracket is considered as nondetectable by the definition of positive signal which is greater than 3 times the standard deviation of the background . 
The standard deviation of the background was 6.6 and the threshold limit for a positive signal was calculated to be 20 ( ) 3 × 6.6 ) . 
could also impede the hybridization process . 
Most of these impurities or fragments of nontarget DNA are removed by the washing steps prior to signal probe hybridization . 
Although the signal probe intensity reached a plateau after 30-min hybridization , it reached more than 80 % of its maximal signal after 20-min hybridization , and thus , we chose 20 min for the secondary hybridization between signal probes and targets in order to save assay time . 
Based on these results , for the remainder of this study we used 40 - and 20-min hybridization times for capture probes and signal probes , respectively . 
Detection Limits of DNA Microarrays . 
Detection limits for each of the DNA probes were determined using serially diluted DNA purified from a S. enteritidis culture ( 108 cfu/mL ) . 
Four single probe-type DNA microarrays were prepared , each with InvA1 , InvA2 , SpvB , and Agf probes , respectively . 
For each array , an average of 70 microspheres was loaded on the microarray . 
The results are shown in Table 3 . 
All four arrays demonstrated increased signal intensity with increasing target concentration ; however , InvA2 and SpvB probes showed higher signal intensities than the other two probes over the tested concentration range . 
As shown in Table 3 , both InvA2 and SpvB probes had the lowest detection limits of 103 cfu/mL , compared to 105 and 108 cfu/mL for InvA1 and Agf , respectively . 
While the detection limits of InvA2 and SpvB probes were satisfactory , the detection limits of InvA1 and Agf probes were high . 
In particular , Agf probes showed very low signal intensities over the tested concentration range . 
Agf probes worked well with synthetic targets , but they exhibited poor performance with DNA samples purified from bacterial cultures . 
Poor Agf probe sensitivity can possibly be explained by the secondary structure of the Agf signal probe , which can form self-dimer and hairpin structures . 
Another possible reason is the low Tm of the Agf signal probe , as demonstrated above with InvE probes and synthetic targets . 
The capture and signal probes used in this study were intended to have a melting temperature of 60 ( 5 °C ; however , InvE and Agf exhibited lower Tms ( ∼ 50 °C ) than desired . 
Our effort to redesign these probes using the probe design software did not provide satisfactory alternative sequences . 
Since we used washing buffers heated to 40 °C for high stringency to prevent nonspecific hybridization , probes with higher Tm would have hybridization stability advantages over low-Tm probes such as InvE and Agf , resulting in higher signal intensities on the array . 
Our final multiplexed microarray design contained both InvA2 and SpvB probes and its performance was tested . 
In the dose-response curve obtained from the multiplexed array , we observed a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude , between 105 and 108 cfu/mL ( Figure 2 ) , which is in agreement with a previous report that well-performing microarray sandwich assays should exhibit a dynamic range of 2-3 orders of magnitude .47 Based on these results , the DNA microarray with InvA2 and SpvB was employed for further studies of specificity and selectivity . 
Specificity of DNA Microarray . 
To study the specificity of the DNA microarrays , the microarray responses to five different strains of Salmonella spp . 
( Table 4 ) and seven other common food pathogens ( Table 5 ) were examined . 
The samples were prepared from bacterial cultures by heating as described above . 
Salmonella strains were tested at two different concentrations , 104 and 107 cfu/mL , and the other pathogens were tested at a higher concentration of 108 cfu/mL . 
As shown in Table 4 , all five strains tested could be detected at both concentrations .

intensity was observed with S. enteritidis , which was expected , as all probes used in this study were designed based on the genomic sequences from S. enteritidis . 
Even though all strains tested were detectable , the signals from Salmonella gaminara were much lower than those from other strains . 
This effect was more apparent at higher target concentrations ; for example , compared to the S. enteritidis signals , the SpvB probe signal from S. gaminara was lower by 52 % at 107 cfu/mL , while it was lower by only 20 % at 104 cfu/mL . 
Spontaneous mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphism at the probe binding sites could be a possible explanation for the low signal intensities observed . 
Boyd et al. reported that Salmonella serovars show sequence diversity in the pathogenicity island ( inv-spa complex ) including invA ; for example , 15.2 % ( 170 of the total 1119 nucleo-tides ) of invA gene showed polymorphisms .48 Since the lengths of our probes were rather short ( 20-35-mer ) , mutations of just a few nucleotides could produce a pronounced difference in hybridization response . 
This mutation effect would be more obvious at higher target concentrations , as a corresponding higher concentration of nontarget DNA or other impurities could impede

specific hybridization between target and probes . 
As no genomic sequence information is available for S. gaminara , it was not possible to determine whether sequence variation caused the lower signal intensity . 
DNA microarray specificity was also evaluated with various food pathogens other than Salmonella spp . 
to study the crossreactivity of the array ( Table 5 ) . 
Samples were prepared from 8 overnight-grown bacterial cultures with a concentration of 10 cfu/mL , the highest concentration obtainable from culture . 
All signal intensities from nontarget pathogens were lower than the threshold limit for a positive signal , three times the standard deviation of the background . 
There was no cross-reactivity of probes with either E. coli strains ( both pathogenic and nonpatho-genic ) or with Yersinia enterocolitica . 
These two organisms have been reported to have cross-reactivity with DNA probes or antibodies for detection of Salmonella spp . 
because of their similarity of genomic sequences or antigenic characteristics caused by genealogical proximity .49 The high specificity of this array is likely due to the use of a sandwich hybridization employing two specific probes ( capture and signal ) . 
Since the signal can be produced only when both probes are specifically hybridized to their target sequences , this dual probe system can avoid false positive signals produced by nonspecific hybridization , a common problem in other detection assays using only one DNA probe . 
The large number of replicates of each DNA probe type is an additional possible reason for the high specificity . 
By using ∼ 100 beads of each probe type in our DNA arrays , false positive/negative signal problems can be avoided . 
Therefore , our DNA array demonstrates the potential for efficient and specific detection of Salmonella spp . 
even in the presence of closely related organisms . 
Detection of Salmonella spp . 
from Artificially Contaminated Samples . 
To study selectivity of the DNA array , we prepared mock foodborne samples as described in the Materials and Methods section . 
As shown in Figure 3 , in the presence of other interfering organisms , the detection limit increased to

104-105 cfu/mL . 
Signal intensities decreased by as much as 65 % , relative to those obtained with the pure culture of S. enteritidis . 
The lower Salmonella detection sensitivity with the mock sample could be explained by the presence of nontarget organisms , which may interfere with the hybridization between the capture probes and target sequences . 
The presence of a high concentration of nontarget DNA can prevent the target DNA from reaching the microsphere-immobilized capture probes , as this assay is performed in 1 h with a small volume ( 200 µL ) . 
The specificity test described above demonstrated that the DNA array did not exhibit any cross-reactivity with other genealogically close pathogens , which suggests that nontarget DNA rarely binds to the capture or signal probes ; however , nontarget DNA can possibly hybridize to the target DNA close to the probe binding site , thereby affecting probe/target hybridization efficiency . 
Therefore , we believe that lower sensitivity is likely due to the hindrance of effective probe / target hybridization by the presence of many nontarget organisms , and is not due to direct binding of other nontarget sequences to the capture probes . 
Even in the presence of other nonspecific organisms , the DNA microarray was able to detect Salmonella spp . 
with only moderate loss of sensitivity . 
This result suggests the potential for the use of the microarray to detect Salmonella spp . 
in environmental samples that contain other interfering organisms . 
We developed DNA microsphere probe arrays for the detection of Salmonella spp . 
using a chemically etched fiber-optic bundle . 
The microarray was able to detect 103-104 cfu/mL of various strains of Salmonella spp . 
in pure culture or 104-105 cfu/mL in a mock sample in the presence of interfering organisms . 
Detection assays on this system can be completed within 1 h , which is much faster than other conventional detection assays . 
Detection was very specific for Salmonella spp. , and no cross-reactivity was observed for genealogically close organisms including E. coli and Y. enterocolitica . 
The fiber-optic DNA microarray is advantageous , as it is easy to fabricate , has a shorter total assay time than other high-density microarray systems , and can minimize false positive and false negative signals , as there are replicates of each DNA probe microsphere on the microarray . 
In this study , we developed a duplexed microarray containing two probe types for Salmonella detection using sandwich hybridization . 
Dual probes provide a higher level of discrimination between target and nontarget organisms . 
In addition , sandwich hybridization requires hybridization of both capture and signal probes to target DNA to produce a fluorescent signal , thereby improving confidence in the detection . 
The DNA microarray described in this study was a duplexed array using two probe types designed for the detection of Salmonella . 
The DNA microarray has the capability to accommodate many more DNA probe types , creating a powerful tool for detecting multiple organisms using a single array . 
Because of the flexibility of the bead-based microarray , with proper probe design , new DNA probes can simply be added to the existing array without affecting the performance of the probes already loaded on the array . 
Thus the addition of more probe types does not require the fabrication of new arrays , as is the case with other microarray systems . 
Currently , we are working on the development of a DNA microarray coupled to PCR for simultaneous detection of multiple food pathogens including Salmonella spp . 
and E. coli O157 : H7 . 
Our preliminary results showed that increase of target DNA by PCR lowered the detection limit for target organisms to as low as 10 cfu/mL . 
With its multiplexing ability , this DNA microarray shows great potential for the rapid simultaneous detection of pathogenic organisms with high sensitivity , offering an alternative to current pathogen screening systems .
