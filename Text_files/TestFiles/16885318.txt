Transcriptome analyses of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium revealed that 15 genes were signiﬁcantly up-regulated after 2 h of adaptation with lactic acid . 
cadB was the most highly up-regulated gene and was shown to be an essential component . 
Lactic acid-adapted cells exhibited sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide , likely due to down-regulation of the OxyR regulon . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium employs both a logarithmic-phase acid tolerance response ( ATR ) and a sta-tionary-phase ATR to cope with acid stress ( 23 ) . 
The logarith-mic-phase HCl-induced ATR requires both pre - and post-acid-shock adaptation phases to be fully tolerant to a pHo of 3.0 at 37 °C ( 13 ) . 
The pre-acid-shock adaptation phase occurs after exposure to pH 5.8 and involves the production of at least 12 acid shock proteins ( 5 ) . 
The gene products of the cad operon ( 1 ) and the atp genes ( 6 , 7 ) all appear to be important in this preshock adaptation phase . 
Salmonella commonly encounters stress from organic acids , either as by-products of its own metabolism ( 25 ) , as food preservatives , or as volatile fatty acids in the intestine ( 12 ) . 
Limited studies have shown that these organic acids protect against subsequent HCl stress ( e.g. , gastric acid ) ( 9 , 10 ) . 
We have recently shown that lactic acid induces a transient ATR in Salmonella serovar Typhimurium at 20 °C , and the maximum ATR occurs at 2 h ( 9 ) . 
We used a transcriptome approach to identify the genes involved in the lactic acid-induced ATR ( L-ATR ) . 
Mid-logarithmic cultures of Salmonella serovar Typhi-murium SL1344 were produced and adapted for 2 h with 0.015 M lactic acid in tryptone soy broth ( TSB ) ( Difco ) at pHo 5.8 as previously described ( 9 ) . 
After adaptation , RNA was stabilized by addition of a phenol-ethanol solution ( 5:95 ) and was immediately transferred to ice prior to extraction . 
RNA samples were prepared using a Promega SV total RNA puriﬁcation kit , and the quality was checked using an RNA nanochip ( with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ) . 
The microarray experiment and analyses of transcriptome data were performed as previously described ( 4 ) . 
We used an indirect `` type 2 '' experimental design ( 26 ) with genomic DNA as a common reference . 
We used two technical replicates for each of two biological replicates . 
The relevant protocols are described at http://www.ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/safety / microarrays/protocols.html . 
The 4,114-feature microarray based on the serovar Typhimurium LT2 genome sequence ( 18 ) has been described previously ( 4 ) .

Following statistical ﬁltering ( false discovery rate , 0.05 ) , changes in gene expression of twofold were considered to be signiﬁcant ( 4 ) . 
A total of 76 genes changed during the L-ATR , and 15 of them were signiﬁcantly up-regulated ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
Only three of these up-regulated genes , cadA , cadB , and cspB , exhibited more than a ﬁvefold increase in the level of expression ( Table 1 ) . 
Expression of cadBA can be induced in Escherichia coli by lowering the external pH in the presence of lysine ( 20 ) . 
This raises the possibility that the high level of cadBA induction observed in the L-ATR may not have been caused by lactic acid per se but could have reﬂected the decrease in the pHo in the presence of lysine in the medium . 
The cadB gene is a component of the lysine decarboxylase system and has a known role in the HCl-induced ATR of Salmo-nella serovar Typhimurium ( 21 ) . 
As cadB was the most highly up-regulated gene in the L-ATR , its role was investigated further . 
Using the Red method ( 3 ) , we replaced the cadB structural gene in SL1344 with a kanamycin resistance marker to generate strain JH2917 . 
The mutation was P22 transduced to a wild-type SL1344 background , and the genotype of the mutant strain was veriﬁed by PCR . 
The following primers were used for PCR ampliﬁcation of the DNA fragment that was recombined with the chromosome from the pKD4 plasmid ( 3 ) : CadB-KO-F ( 5 - TAA GCCCGGTTCTTAAAAATACAGCTCAGGAGAAATGAA CGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC ) and CadB-KO-R ( 5 - GC AGGTGACGAAAGGGGCTTTGAGAAAAAGGAGTTA GCGGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA ) . 
It is possible that the cadB : : kan mutation could have a polar effect on the downstream cadA gene . 
Even if this were the case , the mutant phenotype would remain as a defect in lysine decarboxylase . 
To test whether the lysine decarboxylase system was required for the L-ATR , cultures of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium SL1344 and JH2917 were grown to the mid-logarithmic phase and either adapted with lactic acid prior to acid shock or immediately acid shocked ( unadapted cultures ) as described previously ( 9 ) . 
JH2917 was not able to mount an ATR ( Fig. 1 ) , showing that the lysine decarboxylase system was an essential component of the L-ATR . 
CadA has been shown to be important in the ATR of Vibrio cholerae ( 19 ) , and CadB has been shown to be important but not essential for the HCl-induced ATR in Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( 8 , 21 ) , in which a The complete set of transcriptome data has been submitted to the ArrayExpress database ( www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress ) . 
other amino acid decarboxylase systems can be invoked to restore the ATR phenotype ( 21 ) . 
However , our study demonstrated that JH2917 was unable to mount an ATR even though the organism was provided with a rich source of alternate amino acids . 
Recently , it has been shown that the inhibition of porins by excreted cadaverine may be part of the adaptive mechanism that helps E. coli survive in acidic environments ( 24 ) . 
Our results indicate that a similar adaptive mechanism may be essential for the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium L-ATR , as it requires cadaverine transport mediated by the CadB transport protein . 
The transcriptome data also showed that ﬁve members of the OxyR regulon were down-regulated during the L-ATR ( Table 1 ) ; this regulon is critical for the survival of Salmonella under oxidative stress conditions ( 2 ) . 
Such down-regulation during the L-ATR raised the possibility that although adaptation with lactic acid protected against acidic environments , it was incompatible with the response to oxidative stress . 
To investigate this , lactic acid-adapted and unadapted cultures of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium SL1344 were exposed to an oxidative stress . 
Cells were removed from TSB by ﬁltration through a 0.22 - m membrane ﬁlter ( Millipore ) and were resuspended by vortexing in fresh TSB , and enough of a 30 % ( vol/vol ) solution of hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) ( Sigma ) was added to obtain a concentration of 100 mM . 
Cultures were then reincubated at 20 °C at 120 rpm , and the number of viable cells was determined , as previously described ( 9 ) , every 10 min for 1 h . 
As predicted , the L-ATR cells were vulnerable to oxidative damage and displayed a hypersensitive phenotype compared with unadapted cells ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Cross-protection between different stressors has been well documented ( 11 , 15 , 17 , 22 ) . 
In Salmonella spp. , acid adaptation has been shown to result in tolerance to H2O2 , heat , salt , crystal violet , and poly-myxin B ( 11 , 14 , 15 ) . 
However , acid adaptation has also been shown to sensitize Salmonella serovar Typhimurium to hypo-chlorous acid ( 16 ) . 
Our study demonstrated that the L-ATR in 
562 
Salmonella serovar Typhimurium causes sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide ; the L-ATR appears to inactivate the oxidative stress response via down-regulation of the OxyR regulon . 
Therefore , cells exhibiting the L-ATR are protected against acidic environments but are vulnerable to oxidative stress , a phenotype that could be exploited in preservation regimens . 
This L-ATR-linked peroxide sensitivity contrasts with ﬁndings of other studies in which ATR-linked resistance to hydrogen peroxide was identiﬁed ( 11 , 14 ) . 
In both previous studies the workers found that adaptation of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium with HCl ( 14 ) or mixtures of short-chain fatty acids ( 11 ) induced resistance to hydrogen peroxide , and it is possible that the opposing hydrogen peroxide phenotypes were a consequence of the type of acidulants used in the experiments . 
In this study , we identiﬁed genes involved in the L-ATR of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and related transcriptional changes in bacterial phenotypes , including resistance to acidity and sensitivity to oxidative stress . 
This type of approach highlights the value of transcriptome analysis with DNA microarrays for the food industry , since the protective responses and any linked vulnerabilities associated with particular environmental stresses can be identiﬁed and exploited to enhance food preservation regimens .
