Abstract 
Among more than 2500 serovars , eight contain a virulence plasmid , including medically important Salmonella enterica serovars Choleraesuis , Dublin , Enteritidis , and Typhimurium . 
These serovar-speciﬁc virulence plasmids vary in size , but all contain the spv operon , which plays a role in the expression of the virulence . 
Genetically , these virulence plasmids are likely derived from a common ancestral plasmid possessing virulence-related genes and loci . 
Based on the analysis of the available DNA sequences of the plasmids , the phylogenetic path may be split into two : pSPV ( virulence plasmid of S. GallinarumePullorum ) acquires an incompatibility-related locus that differs from that of the others . 
At some point , pSCV ( virulence plasmid of S. Choleraesuis ) and pSDV ( virulence plasmid of S. Dublin ) lose oriT by recombination or simply by de-letion , making the two unable to be mobilized . 
On the other hand , pSEV ( virulence plasmid of S. Enteritidis ) also loses some DNA by deletion but not as extensively as pSCV , and therefore pSEV is closest to pSTV ( virulence plasmid of S. Typhimurium ) both genetically and biologically . 
The pSTV shows the least alternation during the evolution . 
There are two types of pSDV . 
pSDVu recombines with non-virulence 36.6-kb plasmid to acquire additional incompatibility trait to form pSDVr . 
Recent reports indicated that S. Choleraesuis and S. Typhimurium could generate different types of hybrid plasmids , which consisted of the serovar-speciﬁc virulence plasmid and an array of resistance gene cassettes . 
The recombination gives Salmonella a survival advantage in an unfavorable drug environment . 
The integration of resistance genes and additional re-plicons into a Salmonella virulence plasmid constitutes a new and interesting example of plasmid evolution and poses a serious threat to public health .

1. Introduction
Typhoid fever remains endemic in many areas of the world , and non-typhoid salmonellosis is the most frequently occurring food poisoning worldwide . 
Over 2500 Salmonella serovars are classiﬁed into seven subspecies ; most belong to subspecies I , which infects warm-blood animals only . 
Within subspecies I , eight serovars , namely , Salmonella enterica serovars Abortusovis , Abortusequi , Choleraesuis , Dublin , Enteritidis , GallinarumePullorum , Sendai , and Typhimurium , are known to harbor a serovar-speciﬁc virulence plasmid that contains the spv operon [ 1 ] . 
This spv operon plays a role in the expression of the virulence of the serovars in their speciﬁc hosts [ 1 ] . 
Despite many common properties shared by these virulence plasmids [ 2e6 ] , each virulence plasmid seems to be speciﬁc to its host , exempliﬁed by the plasmid size unique to the serovar e i.e. , the 50-kb pSCV for S. Choleraesuis [ 4 ] , 60-kb pSEV for S. Enteritidis [ 7 ] , 80-kb pSDV for S. Dublin [ 8 ] , 86-kb pSPV for S. Gallinarume Pullorum [ 9 ] , 94.7-kb pSTV for both S. Abortusequi [ 10 ] and S. Typhimurium [ 11 ] , and 285-kb pSSV for S. Sendai e with the exception of 51 - to 66-kb pSAV for S. Abortusovis [ 12 ] . 
Recently , recombinant virulence plasmids have been found in S. Choleraesuis with a size ranging from 125 to 140 kb [ 13 ] and S. Typhimurium with a size of 140 kb [ 14,15 ]

Among the virulence plasmids , virulence plasmids of S. Abortusequi and S. Typhimurium are probably the same , according to the HindIII and BamHI restriction fragment analysis . 
Earlier , the physical and genetic maps of pSCV , pSDV , pSEV , and pSTV were generated and showed variations of these host-speciﬁc virulence plasmids in size and genes [ 4,16,17 ] . 
By now , the nucleotide sequences of two pSCV ( AB040415 and AY509003 ) , pSDVu ( AY517905 , an S. Dublin virulence plasmid ) , and pSTV ( AE006471 ) have been determined . 
The nucleotide sequence of pSDVr , the virulence plasmid of S. Dublin strain Lane , was also fully sequenced and annotated this year ( Ou , unpublished data ) . 
The pSPV and pSEV are still being sequenced in Sanger Centre , UK . 
Interestingly , pSCVs that are larger than 50 kb in size are frequently seen among clinical S. Choleraesuis isolates , and these larger plasmids are likely the result of cointegration or recombination between the 50-kb pSCV and other plasmids , such as drug-resistance plasmids [ 13 ] . 
There are two types of pSDV : a laboratory S. Dublin strain OU7025 harbors two plasmids , an 80-kb virulence plasmid ( pSDVu , pOU1113 ) and a 36.6-kb non-virulence plasmid ( pOU1114 ) , while S. Dublin strain Lane contained a different virulence plasmid ( pSDVr , pOU1115 ) . 
Although pSDVu and pSDVr are both approximately 80 kb in size , pSDVr carries at least two incompatibility group determinants and appears to be formed via recombination between pSDVu and 36.6-kb plasmid ( pOU1114 ) [ 17 ] . 
The complete nucleotide sequence of pSDVu ( pOU1113 ) showed that the plasmid was 80,156 bp long and the G þ C content was 53.7 % , similar to that of a Salmonella chromosome ( strain LT2 , 53 % ) [ 18 ] , pSLT ( a pSTV , 53 % ) [ 18 ] , and pKDSC50 ( a pSCV , 52.1 % ) [ 19 ] . 
This review describes the genetic contents of the virulence plasmids and their role in the virulence , and the evolution of these plasmids and its association with anti-microbial resistance . 
2. Virulence factors and properties of the virulence plasmids
2.1. The spv operon
In addition to the virulence plasmid , the spv ( Salmonella plasmid virulence ) operon can also be found in the chromosome of S. enterica subspecies I , II , IIIa , IV , and VII [ 20 ] . 
The spv operon plays a role in the full expression of virulence of the serovar in its speciﬁc host [ 1,2,9,21 ] . 
The spv operon consists of ﬁve genes , spvRABCD . 
Expression of these genes is regulated by the growth conditions such as those inside the cultured macrophages [ 22 ] , at carbon starvation or at low pH and low iron environment in the presence of carbon [ 23 ] , and at stationary phase under the control of sigma factor , KatF ( RpoS ) [ 24 ] . 
However , the molecular mechanism of spv genes involved in the virulence remains unclear , except that SpvB may be a mono ( ADP-ribosyl ) transferase [ 25 ] that regulates the conversion of G-actin to F-actin for the destabilization of the cytoskeleton of the cell [ 26 ] . 
It has been proposed that the virulence plasmid might be derived from integration of F plasmid into chromosome near the spv operon . 
This integrated F plasmid is then excised from the chromosome to form an F0 plasmid , which carries the spv operon . 
However , subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis identiﬁed transposase-related genes at the ﬂanking region of the spv operon . 
The rlgA ( coding for a putative resolvase protein ) and transposase of IS630 were found located at the 50-region and IS200-like transposase gene and rsd ( coding for a putative integrase ) at the 30-region . 
This suggests that the spv operon of the virulence plasmid could be derived from lateral gene transfer through transposition events . 
The nucleotide as well as the amino acid sequence of the spv region of the following sequenced virulence plasmids is basically 99e100 % identical : pSLT ( a pSTV ) ( AE006471 ) , two pSCVs ( AB040415 and AY509003 ) , and pSDVu ( AY517905 ) . 
2.2. Role of the virulence plasmids in serum resistance and cytokine production
Recent evidence indicates that the virulence plasmids modulate the immune reaction , including complement activation ( serum sensitivity ) , of the animal host in favor of the infecting salmonellae [ 27e29 ] . 
There are a number of loci that inﬂuence the serum sensitivity of the organism . 
Genes rsk and rck are required for serum resistance [ 27,29 e31 ] and located at the 50-region of repA of RepFIB and RepFIIA ( 4 ) . 
All pSTV-related plasmids ( pSCV , pSEV , and pSTV ) contain rsk near the locus spf , a locus that was implicated in suppressing the activation of the host 's immune reaction [ 28 ] ; however , pSDV and pSPV lack rsk and rck [ 16,17 ] . 
Another gene , traT , a surface exclusion protein for plasmid transfer , is also responsible for serum resistance [ 29 ] and is missing in pSEV . 
In S. Tyhimurium , locus spf of pSTV , is associated with IL-12p40 production by mouse macrophages [ 28 ] . 
However , when macrophage-like human THP-1 cells were infected with S. Typhimurium , IL-12p40 production was not conspicuously stimulated . 
Furthermore , S. Typhimurium with or without pSTV efﬁciently stimulates the production of IL-10 . 
These observations were unexpected , but when we take the host-speciﬁcity of S. Typhimurium into consideration , the phenomena were not at all peculiar : the speciﬁc host of S. Typhi-murium is the mouse , although the range of animals it infects is very wide : it infects almost all animals including humans . 
The observed phenomenon might be a manifestation of the host-speciﬁc infection . 
In contrast to the effect in S. Typhimu-rium , the production of IL-12p40 was analyzed ex vivo in mouse macrophages infected with S. Choleraesuis with or without pSCV ( Ou , unpublished data ) . 
Plasmidless S. Choleraesuis stimulated IL-12p40 production efﬁciently , whereas wild type S. Choleraesuis suppressed the production . 
This might also be a manifestation of the host-speciﬁc infection . 
These observations suggest that genes that are responsible for stimulating IL-12p40 production are located on the chromosome of S. Choleraesuis 
These virulence plasmids are deﬁned as the spv type virulence plasmids , because all contain the spv operon that is indispensable in the manifestation of the virulence involving the plasmid [ 1,4 ] . 
In comparisons of the complete nucleotide sequences of the virulence plasmids , the localization and order of the genes ( map ) were consistent in all [ 4,18,19 ] . 
The nucle-otide sequence analysis of the oriT and the genes traI , traY and traM responsible for nicking suggested that there are at least two lineages among the virulence plasmids [ 3,17 ] . 
One contains pSCV , pSEV , and pSTV , and the other pSDV and pSPV . 
Indeed , pSCV and pSEV may have evolved from pSTV by deletions [ 4 ] or evolved to pSTV by recombination [ 13 ] . 
On the other hand , pSDV and pSPV may have evolved from another F-related plasmid , which contains different oriT and transfer-related genes from those of pSTV [ 3 ] . 
The major difference between the two lineages of virulence plasmids resides at the region between ccdAB and repA of RepFIIA [ 4 ] . 
Sequence variations can also be found in the pef operon [ 32 ] and faeH and faeI genes [ 33 ] for bacterial attachment , tra operon for plasmid transfer , and replicons RepFIB and RepFIIA [ 4,16,34 ] for plasmid replication and incompatibility . 
2.4. Replication, maintenance, incompatibility, and mobilizability
Among the virulence plasmids , pSDVu , pSCV , and pSEV are incompatible with pSTV , likely because they belong to the same incompatibility ( Inc ) group [ 35,36 ] , designated as IncTV ( Typhimurium virulence plasmid ) . 
This has now been conﬁrmed by the presence of RepFIIA and RepFIB in these virulence plasmids [ 4 ] , of which the sequences of RepFIIA showed 98e99 % identity among pSDVu , pSTV and pSCV . 
In comparisons of nucleotide sequences of pSCV ( AB040415 and AY509003 ) , pSDVu ( AY517905 ) , and pSTV ( AE006471 ) and the genetic maps [ 4 ] , these virulence plasmids all consist of genes for plasmid partition parVPs [ 37 ] and maintenance coupled with cell division ( ccd ) operon for a host killing function [ 38 ] . 
The two ccd genes , ccdA and ccdB , which are responsible for the post-segregation killing of the segregant , are present in pSTV [ 18 ] as well as in pSDVu with a high sequence identity . 
The ccdA is also present in pSCV with the DNA sequence matching highly to that of pSTV . 
In S. Choleraesuis , therefore , the ccdA gene must be functional . 
Whether or not pSEV and pSPV contain the two genes remains unknown . 
All the virulence plasmids are generally not self-transmissi-ble ; however , pSEV , pSPV and pSTV carry an F or F-like oriT ( origin of transfer ) and thus can be mobilized by an F or F-like conjugative plasmid , whereas pSCV and pSDV are not mobilizable due to the absence of partial tra region from traV to oriT [ 3,39 ] . 
When the remaining tra genes in pSCV and pSDV ( traX , traI , traT , traG through traE segment , traC , PSLT093 , trbI , traC , and PSLT087 ) were compared to the corresponding tra genes of pSTV , they were identical to each other , with more than 98 % identity . 
The pSCV is neither self-transmissible nor mobilizable [ 39 ] , because except for ﬁve tra genes ( ﬁnO , traX , traH , traT , and 63 bp-deleted traD ) , most of the tra genes from traG to oriT are absent . 
Despite the deletions in tra region among pSCV , pSEV and pSDV , analysis of the variation of nucleotide sequences in oriT and the genes traY and traM revealed that pSEV and pSTV were nearly identical but differed from pSPV [ 3 ] . 
These observations indicated that if these plasmids , pSCV and pSEV , were evolved from pSTV , deletion must have occurred in the tra region , and pSDV and pSPV were evolved from other F-like plasmids . 
Previous studies indicated that pSTV could be mobilized but lacked conjugation ability [ 3,39 ] ; however , a recent study revealed that pSTV is self-transmissible [ 40 ] . 
In that study , investigators used the resistance gene ( kanamycin ) of transposon as a probe to determine that the conjugative plasmid was pSTV [ 40 ] . 
In our laboratory , we have examined S. Typhimu-rium strains TML R66 ( OU5042 ) , SR1 ( OU5111 ) , SR-11 ( OU51112 ) , and W118 ( OU5041 ) and found that each strain harbored two plasmids : one pSTV ( 94.7 kb ) and the other co-licin-type plasmid ( 87 kb ) . 
After the virulence plasmid was cured , strain OU5124 , a derivative of OU5112 , and strain OU5062 , a derivative of OU5041 , were transferred with pOU107 ( a pSTV tagged with Tn5 at the pef operon ) to form two transformants OU5386 and OU5761 , respectively . 
A mating experiment was then performed with S. Typhimu-rium LBNP4417 as the recipient . 
All the transconjugants contained a plasmid with a size smaller than that of Tn5-tagged pSTV . 
The conjugation efﬁciency was 10 e10 , which 5 3 was similar to the earlier study [ 40 ] . 
When the non-virulence ( colicin-type ) plasmid was used as a probe , the hybridization signal appeared in the transmissible plasmid , but not in the virulence plasmid . 
The restriction pattern analysis also conﬁrmed the result of DNAeDNA hybridization . 
Our result again con-ﬁrmed that pSTV is not self-transmissible . 
Recently , a selftransferable virulence plasmid was found in S. Typhimurium [ 14 ] . 
Evidence was obtained that this large plasmid was derived from recombination of the 94.7-kb pSTV with drug-resistance plasmid pOG670 [ 15 ] . 
3. Evolution of the virulence plasmids
3.1. pSCV
Those serovars of Salmonella carrying virulence plasmids not only caused enormous economic losses by reducing the production of domestic animals but also infected humans , thereby posing signiﬁcant threats to public health . 
Recent studies showed an increased isolation of Salmonella that are resistant to multiple antibiotics [ 41 ] . 
Drug resistance in Salmonella enterica , along with other resistant pathogens , has become a global problem in human medicine [ 41e44 ] . 
The virulence plasmids have not been known to be a drug-resistance factor before we found that some pSCVs of clinica isolates of S. Choleraesuis carried antibiotic-resistance genes on pSCV , notably sulI and blaTEM-1 coding for resistance to sulfonamide and ampicillin , respectively [ 13 ] . 
These drug-resistant pSCVs are often larger than the most common 50-kb pSCV [ 13 ] . 
Our studies showed that these larger pSCVs were formed by recombination with other plasmids [ 13 ] . 
Basically , pSCV lacks oriT and is not mobilizable ; however , recombination with another R-plasmid may confer transmissibility to pSCV . 
The clinical implication of the evolution of pSCV requires further studies . 
In S. Choleraesuis , a rapid emergence of resistance to cipro-ﬂoxacin has been reported recently , and all of the resistant strains were shown to have mutations that gave rise to the substitution of phenylalanine for serine at position 83 and aspar-agine for aspartic acid at position 87 in GyrA [ 43,44 ] . 
In addition , mutations in ParC leading to an amino acid change from serine to isoleucine at position 80 were also found in most of the ciproﬂoxacin-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates . 
Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is due to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases . 
We have recently isolated a CMY-2-producing S. Choleraesuis that expressed intermediate-level resistance to ceftriaxone [ 44 ] . 
The blaCMY-2 was carried by a transposon-like element on a 140-kb large , non-virulence plasmid . 
In addition , a class 1 integron with a gene cassette carrying dfr and aadA2 genes was found on this plasmid . 
Since the strain also expressed resistance to ciproﬂoxacin , carbapenem became the only agent available for effective treatment . 
The emergence of S. Choleraesuis resistant to ciproﬂoxacin , ceftriaxone , and other conventional antibiotics indeed generates a therapeutic challenge for the treatment of infections caused by this pathogen . 
Whether the resistant plasmid that carries extended-spectrum b-lactamase genes can recombine with the pSCV to cause a severe medical problem deserves continuous monitoring .

3.2. pSDV
In S. Dublin , as mentioned above , two types of pSDV ( pSDVr and pSDVu ) have been found [ 3 ] . 
Generally , S. Dublin strain Lane ( OU7409 ) , a common strain used in microbiological studies all over the world , harbored one 79.1-kb virulence plasmid ( pSDVr ) . 
The other 79.5-kb virulence plasmid ( pSDVu ) was found in strains OU7052 and OU7025 ; the latter also harbored a 36.6-kb non-virulence plasmid . 
We studied these strains by introducing the Tn5-tagged pSDVr into OU7052 and OU7025 and 
Tn5-tagged pSDVu into OU7409 ( Table 1 ) . 
When OU7025 and OU7052 were introduced with pSDVr , the original pSDVu as well as the non-virulence plasmid was expelled , and the transformants harbored Tn5-tagged pSDVr . 
In contrast , introduction of Tn5-tagged pSDVu into OU7409 did not repulse the pSDVr from OU7409 . 
We found that the transformants selected harbored a Tn5-tagged pSDVr , indicating that the Tn5 transposed onto pSDVr from pSDVu while pSDVu was expelled . 
Furthermore , in DNAeDNA hybridization , pSDVr hybridized to a probe made from the 36.6-kb non-virulence plasmid . 
The result suggests that pSDVr contained two replicons , one from the 36.6-kb non-virulence plasmid and the other from pSDVu . 
We recently sequenced pSDVr and the 36.6-kb plasmid and found that pSDVr differed from pSDVu in the region of traI and samA . 
In pSDVr , this region was substituted by a DNA fragment from the 36.6-kb non-virulence plasmid , which carried a ﬁmbriae operon and genes responsible for the plasmid stability ( Ou , unpublished data ) . 
3.3. pSTV
Recent studies identiﬁed new pSTVs that were both selftransferable and drug resistant [ 14,15,45 ] . 
Different from pSLT ( the virulence plasmid of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 ) , the 140-kb self-transmissible virulence plasmid pUO-StVR2 carried a class I integron with qacED1/sulI and the transposon Tn21 and lacked rck [ 14 ] , a gene also missing in pSCV , pSDV , and pSPV [ 4 ] . 
This suggests that pUO-StVR2 may differ from the original pSTV through recombination or may be a derivative from pSCV , pSDV , and pSPV . 
An integration of conjugative plasmid pOG670 to pSLT has increased the transmissibility of pSLT . 
The recombination occurred in the 12.7-kb HindIII-digested fragment , which consists of genes from spvD to pefAC , including IS200-lik transposase and rsd ( putative integrase ) . 
Another recent study also found a pSTV in a multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium strain carrying the spvC , rck , and pefA virulence genes and two class 1 integrons linked to the Tn21 and Tn1696 transposons [ 45 ] . 
A novel trimethoprim-resistance gene , designated dfrA23 , was identiﬁed within the integron region [ 45 ] . 
Because S. Typhimurium is the most common serovar that causes human infections , the association of multidrug resistance and the virulence plasmid , as has been dem-onstrated in S. Choleraesuis , presents a serious problem to public health .

There are two lineages among the Salmonella virulence plasmids . 
One includes pSCV , pSEV , and pSTV . 
pSCV and pSEV appear to be derived from pSTV through a deletion event that occurred at two different locations . 
The other line-age of pSDV and pSPV differs from the previous group in a 12-kb DNA region , which consists of faeH and faeI genes , rather than the pef operon . 
Evolution of the virulence plasmid is not simply a deletion event , but includes a rapid process of gene acquisition and recombination to ensure the survival of the host Salmonella as well as the stability of the plasmid itself . 
The recombination of the virulence plasmids pSCV and pSTV with resistance plasmids provides Salmonella not only with a survival advantage in an unfavorable drug environment but also the opportunity to propagate into a new genetic line-age . 
In the case of pSDV , the recombination with a cryptic plasmid at least adds a second replicon to the plasmid , thereby ensuring the success of plasmid replication within Salmonella . 
The development of such recombinant plasmids may also extend the host range of these plasmids [ 46 ] . 
Taken together , these trends may lead to the occurrence and spread of more virulent and resistant non-typhoid Salmonella .
