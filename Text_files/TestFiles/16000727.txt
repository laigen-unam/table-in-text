A 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) elicits the starvation-stress response ( SSR ) due to starvation for an essential nutrient , e.g. a carbon/energy source ( C-source ) . 
As part of the SSR , the alternative sigma factor σE is activated and induced . 
The authors suspect that this activation is , in part , triggered by changes in the S. Typhimurium cell envelope occurring during the adaptation from growth to carbon/energy starvation ( C-starvation ) , and resulting in an increased need for σE-regulated factors involved in the proper folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins destined for this extracytoplasmic compartment . 
This led to the hypothesis that a σE activation signal might arise during C-source shifts that cause the induction of proteins localized to the extracytoplasmic compartment , i.e. the outer membrane or periplasm , of the cell . 
To test this hypothesis , cultures were grown in minimal medium containing enough glucose to reach mid-exponential-phase , plus a non-limiting amount of a secondary ` less-preferred ' but utilizable carbon / energy source . 
The σE activity was then monitored using plasmids carrying rpoEP1 -- and rpoEP2 -- lacZ transcriptional fusions , which exhibit σE-independent and - dependent lacZ expression , respectively . 
The secondary C-sources maltose , succinate and citrate , which have extracytoplasmic components involved in their utilization ( e.g. LamB ) , resulted in a discernible diauxic lag period and a sustained increase in σE activity . 
Growth transition from glucose to other utilizable phosphotransferase ( PTS ) and non-PTS C-sources , such as trehalose , mannose , mannitol , fructose , glycerol , D-galactose or L-arabinose , did not cause a discernible diauxic lag period or a sustained increase in σE activity . 
Interestingly , a shift from glucose to melibiose , which does not use an extracytoplasmic-localized protein for uptake , did cause an observable diauxic lag period but did not result in a sustained increase in σE activity . 
In addition , overexpression of LamB from an arabinose-inducible promoter leads to a significant increase in σE activity in the absence of a glucose to maltose shift or C-starvation . 
Furthermore , a ΔlamB : : Ω-Kmr mutant , lacking the LamB maltoporin , exhibited an approximately twofold reduction in the sustained σE activity observed during a glucose to maltose shift , again supporting the hypothesis . 
Interestingly , the LamB protein lacks the typical Y-X-F terminal tripeptide of the OmpC-like peptides that activate DegS protease activity leading to σE activation . 
It does , however , possess a terminal pentapeptide ( Q-M-E-I-W-W ) that may function as a ligand for a putative class II PDZ-binding site . 
The authors therefore propose that the σE regulon of S. Typhimurium not only is induced in response to deleterious environmental conditions , but also plays a role in the adaptation of cells to new growth conditions that necessitate changes in the extracytoplasmic compartment of the cell , which may involve alternative signal recognition and activation pathways that are independent of DegS .

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) is an aetiological agent of water/food-borne gastrointestinal-based disease in both animals and humans ( Spector , 1998 ) . 
An important feature of S. Typhimurium epidemiology and pathogenesis in both warm-and cold-blooded hosts is its ability to sense , adapt to and survive in a number of environments that expose the bacteria to stresses , such as nutrient starvation , extremes in osmolarity , temperatures or pH , which can threaten viability and/or limit growth ( Spector , 1998 ; Humphreys et al. , 1999 , 2003 ) . 
Thus , bacterial responses to these stresses can affect the spread and pathogenesis of this important pathogen . 
One of the most common stresses encountered by S. Typhimurium , and many other bacteria , outside the confines of the laboratory is starvation for a carbon/energy source ( C-source ) . 
S. Typhimurium , as well as other non-spore-forming bacteria , responds to carbon/energy starvation ( C-starvation ) with global alterations in gene expression , morphology and physiology . 
This response is known as the starvation-stress response ( SSR ) ( Spector & Cubitt , 1992 ; Seymour et al. , 1996 ; Spector , 1998 ; Spector et al. , 1999b ) . 
The SSR serves two functions : ( 1 ) to combat the long-term effects of C-starvation , and ( 2 ) to generate crossresistance to other environmental stresses . 
The SSR includes aspects of : ( a ) avoidance , involving the production of new or higher-affinity C-source-utilization systems in an attempt to scavenge any utilizable C-sources from the environment ; and ( b ) starvation/stress survival if an alternative C-source remains unavailable , ultimately generating a more efficient and hardy cell ( Spector , 1998 ) . 
The SSR genes identified thus far are under the control of one or more of three sigma factors , σ70 , σS and σE ( O'Neal et al. , 1994 ; Spector et al. , 1999a ; Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) . 
The alternative sigma factor σS is encoded by the rpoS gene ( Tanaka et al. , 1993 ) . 
During the SSR , σS is induced early in the response to C-starvation in both Salmonella and Escherichia coli ( W. J. Kenyon & M. P. Spector , unpublished data ; Fang et al. , 1992 ; Tanaka et al. , 1993 ) , and during the shift from glucose to lactose utilization in E. coli ( Fischer et al. , 1998 ) . 
Glucose is the carbon source of choice for Salmonella and many other bacteria . 
While Salmonella is growing on glucose , the uptake and utilization of other carbon sources is inhibited , in part as a result of catabolite repression and/or inducer exclusion ( Notley & Ferenci , 1995 ; Moat et al. , 2002 ) . 
Glucose exhaustion results in a shift to utilize alternative C-sources present in the growth medium . 
In E. coli , a shift from glucose to lactose utilization causes growth to transiently halt , producing what is called a diauxic lag period . 
During diauxie , functions needed for lactose utilization are induced , allowing the cell to resume growth . 
In addition , σS and σS-dependent genes are induced during this diauxic lag period ( Fischer et al. , 1998 ) . 
The alternative sigma factor σE ( encoded by the rpoE gene ) is activated by certain stresses to the cell envelope that lead to the accumulation of denatured/unfolded proteins ( Mecsas et al. , 1993 , 1995 ; Missiakas et al. , 1996 ; Jones et al. , 1997 ; Alba et al. , 2002 ) . 
Previous studies indicate that , once activated , σE initiates the transcription of several genes with extracytoplasmic functions required for the cell envelope to combat the effects of the stress . 
In the absence of stress , σE is normally bound to the inner-membrane ( IM ) protein RseA , an

anti-sigma factor or inhibitor of σE , preventing its interaction with RNA polymerase , and thus the transcription of σE-dependent genes ( De Las Penas et al. , 1997 ; Missiakas et al. , 1997 ; Alba et al. , 2002 , Miticka et al. , 2003 ) . 
When a specific stress occurs to the cell envelope , RseA is degraded by DegS and YaeL , σE is then released and is able to bind to core RNA polymerase ( E ) . 
EσE then directs the transcription of its dependent genes , many of which possess extracytoplasmic functions . 
A number of σE-regulated genes identified in E. coli encode cell-envelope-associated proteins that act on misfolded proteins , leading to their degradation , proper refolding or correct insertion into the outer membrane ( OM ) , e.g. periplasmic ( PP ) proteases , peptidyl-prolyl isomerases and molecular chaperones ( Erickson & Gross , 1989 ; Danese & Silhavy , 1997 ; Dartigalongue et al. , 2001 ; Alba et al. , 2002 ) . 
Previous findings in our laboratory ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) showed that σE activity and protein levels increase during the initial 4 -- 5 h of C-starvation , and reach peak levels at around 48 -- 72 h of C-starvation . 
This suggests that C-starvation produces signals that lead to σE activation . 
Furthermore , rpoE mutants are defective in long-term C-starvation and C-starvation-inducible cross-resistance ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) , indicating that σE is an additional key regulator of the SSR . 
What is more , σE is critical for the virulence of S. Typhimurium in the mouse virulence model ( Humphreys et al. , 1999 ) . 
In an effort to discern the role of the σE regulon in the SSR , we examined its activity in the avoidance component of the SSR by measuring σE-dependent transcription during shifts from glucose to less-preferred but utilizable C-sources . 
Here we report that shifts to some but not all secondary C-sources tested resulted in a sustained increase in σE activity . 
The common feature of C-sources resulting in increased σE activity appears to be the induction of an OM-associated and/or PP-binding-protein component involved in its utilization . 
Based on our findings and apparent common features of these utilization systems , we hypothesized that one or more members of the σE regulon is needed for the adaptation of the cell envelope to growth on less-preferred but utilizable C-sources , specifically those C-sources with transport systems possessing extracytoplasmic solute receptors and/or OM proteins . 
Therefore , σE-regulated functions appear to play a role not only in the responses to certain environmental stresses , but also in the adaptation of Salmonella to new environmental conditions not typically associated with cell envelope stress . 
Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotide primers—The bacterial strains,
plasmids and oligonucleotide primers ( Invitrogen ) used are listed in Table 1 . 
Transductions were carried out using the high-transducing derivative of bacteriophage P22 , P22 HT int-105 ( Chan et al. , 1972 ) . 
All strains were determined to be non-lysogens for P22 by demonstrating sensitivity to the H5 derivative of bacteriophage P22 ( Maloy , 1990 ) . 
Media and supplements -- Cultures of the desired strains were grown in a modified MOPS-buffered salts ( MS ) minimal medium ( Neidhardt et al. , 1974 ) containing either 0 · 4 % ( w/v ) glucose ( MS hiC ) or 0 · 03 % ( w/v ) glucose ( MS loC ) , and are described in detail elsewhere ( Spector & Cubitt , 1992 ; O'Neal et al. , 1994 ) . 
Histidine was added to minimal medium to a final concentration of 20 μM . 
The appropriate antibiotics were added as needed : ampicillin ( Ap ) ( 30 μg ml − 1 ) , kanamycin ( Km ) ( 50 μg ml − 1 ) and chloramphenicol ( Cm ) ( 50 μg ml − 1 ) . 
The rich medium used was Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth and agar ( Difco ) . 
single-primer PCR , DNA sequence analysis and BLASTP search analysis as previously described ( Spector et al. , 1999a , b ) . 
The insertion of the MudJ : : lac in lamB was confirmed by the presence of the correct size PCR product using chromosomal DNA from ST55 as a template , a forward primer specific for the 3 ′ - end of MudJ ( PR18 ) and a reverse primer specific for the 3 ′ - end of lamB ( PR49 ) . 
ntification of a lamB : : MudJ ( lac Kmr ) - carrying strain from a library of C-rvation-inducible MudJ : : lac fusion ( insertion ) strains -- A lamB : : MudJ ( lac r ) fusion-carrying strain was identified from our library of strains carrying MudJ ( lac r ) insertions demonstrating C-starvation induction ( Spector et al. , 1988 , 1999a ) , using

Growth and σE activation during C-source shifts -- For growth and σE-activation analysis during glucose to alternative C-source shifts , overnight cultures of the desired strains were diluted 1 : 100 into fresh MS loC medium supplemented with one of the following : maltose , succinate , citrate , melibiose , D-trehalose , D-mannose , D-mannitol , D-fructose , glycerol , L-arabinose or D-galactose , all at a final concentration of 0 · 4 % ( w/v ) , or no additional C-source ( all C-sources were purchased from Sigma ) . 
The appropriate antibiotics were added as needed . 
The concentration of glucose in MS loC is the concentration used to produce C-starved cells ( Spector & Cubitt , 1992 ; O'Neal et al. , 1994 ; Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) and provides sufficient glucose to support growth for 3 -- 4 generations before being exhausted . 
Therefore , growth can only continue if an alternative utilizable C-source is available in the growth medium . 
Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically by determining OD600 at pre-determined time intervals . 
Activation of σE was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity as a reporter of promoter activity from plasmid pTF-P2 ; in addition , β-galactosidase activity driven by a rpoE-independent promoter ( pTF-P1 ) was measured as a control ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) . 
βGalactosidase activity was assayed by the method of Miller ( 1992 ) and is expressed in Miller units . 
The results presented represent the mean ± SEM from at least three separate experiments . 
Generation of the lamB deletion mutant -- The λ-Red mutagenesis system provides a more efficient way of disrupting and deleting chromosomal genes , allowing the characterization of a gene 's function ( Datsenko & Wanner , 2000 ) , using the precise insertion of a selected antibiotic-resistance cassette into the gene of interest accompanied by a selected deletion . 
Using a slightly modified protocol and S. Typhimurium strain ST276 ( carrying pKD46 , a plasmid with the λ-Red recombination enzymes under the control of the L-arabinose-inducible ParaBAD promoter ; Table 1 ) , we constructed a defined deletion of the lamB gene from the S. Typhimurium chromosome , replacing it with an Ω-Kmr cassette . 
Following the protocol of Datsenko & Wanner ( 2000 ) , a PCR product was generated containing the Kmr cassette from pKD4 and sequence from the flanking region of the lamB gene of S. Typhimurium . 
PCR primers PR122 and PR123 ( Table 1 ) were designed to contain a 40 bp sequence homologous to lamB DNA , and a sequence corresponding to the P1 and P2 sites on pKD4 . 
PCR reactions using these primers , PCR SuperMix High Fidelity ( Invitrogen ) and pKD4 as a template were run in an Ericomp Thermal Cycler . 
The size of the PCR product ( approximately 1 · 6 kb ) was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis , and the DNA was cleaned using the Promega Wizard PCR Prep Kit . 
The DNA was then digested with DpnI ( Promega ) for 3 h at 37 °C , and cleaned using the Promega Wizard DNA Clean-up Kit . 
Electrocompetent cells of strain ST276 were prepared by growing an overnight culture of ST276 in 1 ml LB-Ap with shaking at 37 °C . 
The following morning , the overnight culture was diluted 1 : 100 into 25 ml of LB containing 1 mM L-arabinose , and grown to an OD600 of between 0 · 6 and 0 · 8 . 
Freshly grown cells were pelleted , washed twice with 10 ml ice-cold sterile distilled water , and once with 10 ml ice-cold sterile 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol . 
DpnI-digested DNA was then electroporated into the freshly prepared electrocompetent cells using an E. coli Pulsar electroporation unit and the protocol provided by the manufacturer ( BioRad ) . 
The cells were plated onto LB-Km agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C . 
Km-resistant colonies were then streaked for isolation onto LB-Km agar , and DNA was isolated from LB-Km overnight cultures using the Promega Genomic DNA Purification Kit . 
The presence of the 
Construction of plasmid pKS34 carrying lamB under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter , ParaBAD : : lamB -- Chromosomal DNA isolated from S. Typhimurium SL1344 ( Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit ; Promega ) served as template for high-fidelity PCR amplification ( Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity ; Invitrogen ) of the lamB gene using the forward primer PR48 and the reverse primer PR49 ( Table 1 ) . 
The 1 · 4 kb PCR product was purified and ligated into pGEM-T Easy ( Promega ) , and E. coli JM109 competent cells ( Promega ) were transformed with this , following the manufacturer 's protocols . 
Plasmid minipreps ( Wizard Plus Minipreps ; Promega ) from the ampicillin-resistant transformants were screened by PCR using primers PR48 and PR29 ( Table 1 ) to determine that the insert was oriented in the same direction as the lacZ gene in order to facilitate cloning into pBAD33 . 
The subsequent plasmid was designated pKS33 . 
Digestion of pKS33 with SacI and SphI yielded a 1 · 5 kb fragment carrying the lamB gene . 
This fragment was isolated using agarose gel electrophoresis , extracted ( Freeze ′ N Squeeze columns ; Bio-Rad ) and cleaned ( Wizard DNA Clean-Up System ; Promega ) . 
It was then ligated with SacI/SphI-digested pBAD33 ( a generous gift from Dr Jon Beckwith , Harvard University , Boston , MA , USA ) , and E. coli JM109 cells ( Promega ) were transformed with it and plated onto LB-Cm plates . 
Plasmid minipreps ( Wizard Plus Minipreps ; Promega ) from transformant colonies were screened for the lamB insert by digestion with SacI and SphI , and agarose gel electrophoresis . 
The resultant plasmid was designated pKS34 . 
Overexpression of LamB and σE activation -- To measure the effect of LamB overproduction on σE activation as measured from a σE-dependent promoter in pTF-p2 we transformed SMS760 ( SL1344/pTF-p 2 ) with pKS34 to produce strain SMS908 ( Table 1 ) . 
The desired strains were grown overnight in LB plus the appropriate antibiotic . 
Overnight cultures were then diluted 1 : 100 into fresh LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic ( s ) , and grown to mid-exponential phase before being divided into six separate cultures to which 0 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 or 400 μM L-arabinose was added . 
Cultures were then incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C with aeration , at which point β-galactosidase activity was assayed using the method of Miller ( 1992 ) . 
In S. Typhimurium , a number of C-source utilization enzymes and systems are induced during the transition from growth to C-starvation in an effort to scavenge any and all available Csources , and avoid entry into the physiologically more drastic ` survival ' mode ( Spector , 1998 ) . 
Many of the utilization systems involve the induction of OM , PP and/or IM components in addition to cytoplasmic proteins . 
An example of an OM component of an alternative Csource utilization system is LamB , which functions as a porin-like protein involved in the uptake of maltose and maltodextrins ( Schulein & Benz , 1990 ; Hall et al. , 1997 ) . 
Induction of a lamB : : lacZ fusion during C-starvation , as well as during shifts from glucose to maltose , showed that lamB is induced approximately 17-fold by C-starvation ( 1 · 4 ± 0 · 4 Miller units in exponential-phase cells compared to 23 · 9 ± 2 · 4 Miller units in 5 h C-starved cells ) , and approximately 46-fold during shifts from glucose to maltose ( 1 · 5 ± 0 · 7 Miller units in cells prior to the shift to maltose compared to 70 · 1 ± 1 · 7 Miller units 4 h after the shift to maltose ) . 
These results , along with previous findings that σE is a key regulator of the SSR and is activated within the first few hours of C-starvation ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) , led us to examine the role of σE early in the SSR during the ` avoidance ' phase . 
For this , we assessed σE activity during the transition from growth on glucose to less-preferred but utilizable C-sources in S. Typhimurium . 
Fig. 1 ( a ) illustrates the typical increase in σE activity ( as determined by increased βgalactosidase expression driven by an σE-dependent promoter ) observed during C-starvation ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) , and is included for comparison purposes . 
Shifts from glucose to maltose , citrate or succinate all produced discernible , yet transient , diauxic lag periods , and more importantly sustained increases in σE activity ( Fig. 1b -- d ) comparable to C-starved cells ( Fig. 1a ) over the same time period . 
In contrast , shifts from glucose to maltose , citrate , succinate or any other alternative C-source tested , as well as C-starvation , produced relatively constant βgalactosidase activity [ 2478 ± 69 ( SEM ) Miller units ] over the same time period from the σE-independent ( σ70-dependent ) promoter in pTF-p1 . 
desired mutation was confirmed by PCR analysis using primers PR48 and PR49 ( Table 1 ) specific for the lamB sequence outside of the deletion site . 
RESULTS AND DISCCUSION 
Shifts from glucose to maltose , citrate or succinate result in a sustained increase in σE activity 
A common feature of the utilization systems for these C-sources appears to be the presence of an OM - and/or PP-protein component in addition to IM transporters . 
In S. Typhimurium , this includes the LamB OM-maltoporin complex and the MalE extracytoplasmic solute receptor ( binding protein ) for maltose utilization ( Schulein & Benz , 1990 ; Hall et al. , 1997 ; Lawhon et al. , 2003 ) . 
Utilization of citrate ( a C6-tricarboxylate ) involves an extracytoplasmic ( PP ) solute-receptor ( binding ) protein without a specific OM component . 
TctC is the tricarboxylate-binding-receptor component of the TctABC tripartite-tricarboxylate transporter ( TTT ) of S. Typhimurium involved in citrate utilization ( Winnen et al. , 2003 ) . 
The scenario for succinate utilization in S. Typhimurium is more complicated . 
The homologues of the dctPQM genes encoding the aerobic dicarboxylate-transporter system DctPQM in Rhodobacter capsulatus ( Rabus et al. , 1999 ; Janausch et al. , 2002 ) are apparently absent from the S. Typhimurium genome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
However , there are at least three hypothetical genes encoding putative extracytoplasmic solute receptors for C4-dicarboxylates that may play a role in succinate utilization ( STM3169 , GenBank accession number AE008845 ,17756 -- 18746 ; yiaO , accession number AE008870 , 9637 -- 10623 ; STM4054 , accession number AE008889 , complement 10233 -- 11216 ) . 
Of these three , YiaO along with YiaM/YiaN , and STM4054 along with STM4052/STM4053 may constitute tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic - ( TRAP ) transporter systems involved in succinate utilization ( Rabus et al. , 1999 ; Janausch et al. , 2002 ) . 
In addition , S. Typhimurium possesses the genes for two other C4-dicarboxylate-transport systems : ( 1 ) the anaerobic Dcu dicarboxylate-transporter system , which appears to be involved in fumarate respiration rather than C4-dicarboxylate utilization and as part of this function actually results in succinate efflux from the cytoplasm ( Janausch et al. , 2002 ) , and ( 2 ) a homologue of the DctA H + / Na + : C4-dicarboxylate / dicarboxylic amino acid symporter , which was found to be a major C4-dicarboxylate transporter during aerobic growth in E. coli . 
Mutants of dctA in E. coli grow very poorly or not at all on succinate and other C4-dicarboxylates ( Davies et al. , 1999 ) . 
However , its cognate extracytoplasmic solute receptor ( i.e. succinate-binding protein ) has not been definitively identified . 
In E. coli , the cbt gene was proposed as the putative C4-dicarboxylate-binding protein possibly as part of an OM porin ( Lo , 1977 ; Lo & Bewick , 1981 ) . 
Whether this complex is expressed under the conditions tested in this study has not been demonstrated , but recent evidence suggests that cbt may be an allele of the ferric-enterobactin-transport component gene fepA , which is iron regulated ( Braun & Braun , 2002 ) in both E. coli and Salmonella . 
Thus , the involvement of PP and/or OM component ( s ) in succinate utilization in S. Typhimurium , although likely , is ambiguous and clearly complicated . 
sugars , and some other non-PTS sugars , is catabolite repressed and/or subject to inducer exclusion during growth on glucose . 
This is in part a result of low intracellular levels of the signal nucleotide cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) caused by greatly reduced adenylate cyclase activity , resulting from greatly reduced levels of the phosphorylated Enzyme IIA component of the glucose-specific PTS ( P ~ EnzIIAgluc ) . 
The exhaustion of glucose leads to accumulation of P ~ Enz IIAgluc and the activation of adenylate cyclase . 
The resulting increased cAMP levels , and in some cases the presence of the C-source ( or a derivative ) , induces the expression of the utilization enzymes for the secondary C-source . 
For some of these C-sources , this involves the production of specific Enzyme IIA and IIB components for its PTS . 
The IIB component for these PTS sugars is an IM protein , while their IIA component is associated with the cytoplasmic side of the IM ; however , there are no PP or OM components involved in the PTS . 
We therefore wanted to determine if shifts from glucose to known PTS sugars might also generate signals leading to sustained σE activation . 
Shifts from glucose to the PEP : PTS-dependent sugars trehalose , mannose , mannitol or fructose do not result in a sustained increase in σE activity 
Many sugars are translocated into the cell by the phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ) : sugar phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) ( Postma et al. , 1993 ) . 
The utilization of secondary PTS 
In contrast to maltose , citrate and succinate , a shift from glucose to the PTS-dependent sugars trehalose ( Fig. 2a ) , fructose ( Fig. 2b ) , mannose or mannitol ( data not shown ) did not lead to a discernible diauxic lag period or sustained σE activation . 
Results for mannose and mannitol were very similar to that of fructose . 
These results indicate that a shift from glucose to a secondary C-source , in general , is insufficient to cause sustained σE activation . 
It also demonstrated more specifically that shifts from glucose to PTS sugars do not generate signals leading to sustained σE activation , thus supporting our hypothesis , given that their utilization does not involve PP and/or OM components . 
ifts from glucose to the non-PTS C-sources melibiose , l-arabinose , d-galactose or glycerol not result in a sustained increase in σE activity 
h o 
S d 
Some secondary C-sources do not require the PTS for their utilization , but instead rely on a specific IM-associated transporter , permease or channel to bring them into the cytoplasm for utilization ; although they may exhibit catabolite repression and/or inducer exclusion ( as described above ) . 
Moreover , in some cases , their expression in S. Typhimurium is uncertain . 
Examples of non-PTS C-sources that exhibit these characteristics include glycerol , L-arabinose , D-galactose and melibiose in S. Typhimurium ( Postma , 1977 ; Muller et al. , 1985 ; Benner-Luger & Boos , 1988 ; Horazdovsky & Hogg , 1989 ; Kehres & Hogg , 1992 ; Moat et al. , 2002 ) . 
Thus , we examined whether shifts from glucose to one of these C-sources would result in a sustained increase in σE activity . 
Neither shifts from glucose to melibiose ( Fig. 3a ) , L-arabinose ( Fig. 3b ) , D-galactose , nor glycerol ( data not shown ) resulted in a sustained increase in σE activity ; although there was a transient increase in some cases . 
The results for D-galactose and glycerol were very similar to the result for L-arabinose . 
Interestingly , the shift from glucose to melibiose produced an observable transitory diauxic lag period , but again this was not accompanied by a sustained elevation in σE activity ( Fig. 3a ) . 
These latter findings suggest that it is not the occurrence of a diauxic lag period that results in signals leading to a sustained rise in σE activity . 
In E. coli , there appears to be a high-affinity arabinose-transport system encoded by the araFGH operon , with AraF being an arabinose-binding protein and AraGH composing an IM-transport system ( Horazdovsky & Hogg , 1989 ; Kehres & Hogg , 1992 ) . 
However , the araFG genes are not present in the S. Typhimurium genome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; GenBank accession number AE006468 or NC_003197 ) . 
This supports our hypothesis since the PP-binding protein for arabinose AraF would not be produced . 
Database analysis of the S. Typhimurium LT-2 genome sequence did not indicate known or putative AraF homologues . 
galactoside Mgl system ( Postma , 1977 ; Muller et al. , 1985 ; Benner-Luger & Boos , 1988 ) . 
The mglB-encoded protein is a PP-binding protein that can bind to galactose as well as other sugars , e.g. fucose . 
Although this might appear contradictory to our hypothesis , galactose only slightly induces the mgl genes in a galP + strain background ( Postma , 1977 ; Muller et al. , 1985 ; BennerLuger & Boos , 1988 ) . 
Thus , the MglB protein is not induced significantly under our experimental conditions . 
So , the lack of a sustained increase in σE activity during a glucose to D-galactose shift can still be explained in the context of our hypothesis . 
The pertinent characteristics for all the secondary C-sources tested are summarized in Table 2 . 
In both E. coli and S. Typhimurium , D-galactose can be transported into the cell through the galactose-specific galactose permease GalP or the binding-protein-dependent methyl ¬ 
Inability to produce the LamB protein reduces the activation of σE during a shift from glucose to maltose 
As stated previously , a common feature of maltose , citrate and succinate utilization appears to be the production of an OM and/or extracytoplasmic ( PP ) solute-receptor component ( s ) involved in their utilization , e.g. the LamB OM-porin-like protein complex ( Schulein & Benz , 1990 ) , or the extracytoplasmic solute receptors involved in C4-dicarboxylate and C6-tricarboxylate transport ( Widenhorn et al. , 1988 ; Rabus et al. , 1999 ; Janausch et al. , 2002 ; Winnen et al. , 2003 ) . 
Another possible factor involved in σE activation under these conditions might be a slower growth rate produced by the secondary C-source , e.g. shifts to citrate or succinate ( Fig. 1b -- c ) . 
To investigate this , we created a targeted deletion of the lamB gene to knock-out LamB production . 
We targeted the lamB gene for several reasons . 
First , it is not essential for the utilization of maltose , yet it is induced during shifts from glucose to maltose ( discussed above ) . 
Second , a lamB : : Ω-Km mutant strain ( SMS871 ) exhibits virtually identical growth , compared to the wild-type parent strain , during glucose to maltose shifts ( Fig. 4a ) . 
Furthermore , the situation for citrate or succinate utilization is problematic for this study . 
Mutants of tctC , lacking the extracytoplasmic tricarboxylate-binding-protein/receptor component , are defective in citrate utilization ( Winnen et al. , 2003 ) , and thus may mimic conditions of C-starvation . 
What 's more , succinate utilization in Salmonella is not very well characterized . 
There are at least three putative C4-dicarboxylate-binding proteins in the S. Typhimurium genome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) , and the presence of C4-dicarboxylate PP - and/or OM-utilization components in S. Typhimurium as well as E. coli still requires clarification . 
Deletion of one or more of the C4-dicarboxyate PP-binding proteins is likely to make the cells defective in succinate utilization similar to the scenario for citrate utilization . 
As would be predicted from our hypothesis , the fold-induction of the σE-dependent promoter is reduced in a lamB knock-out mutant to ~ 50 % of the fold-induction levels seen in the wildtype parent : a twofold-induction compared to a fourfold-induction , respectively ( Fig. 4b ) . 
Residual activation of σE may be the result of the production of MalE , the extracytoplasmic maltose-binding protein/receptor required for maltose utilization , as well as other maltodextrin-utilization proteins that are also expressed under these conditions ( Hall et al. , 1997 ) . 
A previous study in E. coli found that at lower levels of expression a folding-defective MalE protein is degraded by DegP or Protease III ( Betton et al. , 1998 ) , supporting this idea . 
Unfortunately , knocking-out a required utilization component , such as MalE , would prevent growth on the Csource , and would again mimic C-starvation . 
But the fact that the loss of LamB production stifles the increase in σE activity normally seen during glucose to maltose shifts , yet the lamB mutant exhibits virtually indistinguishable growth rates under these conditions ( Fig. 4a ) , supports the hypothesis that one or more σE-regulated functions are needed for efficient LamB incorporation into the OM during this adaptation process . 
To further demonstrate that up-regulated expression of LamB directly results in increased σE activity , we overproduced LamB from the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter in pBAD33 ( Guzman et al. , 1995 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 5 , increased σE activity was observed when we artificially overproduced LamB from an arabinose-inducible promoter ( SMS908 ) in the absence of glucose starvation or during a glucose to maltose shift ( Fig. 5b ) . 
An increase in σE activity was not observed under these conditions in a strain lacking the pKS34 plasmid ( SMS760 ) , indicating that it is the overproduction of LamB and not the addition of arabinose itself that results in increased σE activity . 
Furthermore , the increased levels of β-galactosidase activity observed with rising concentrations of arabinose in SMS908 ( Fig. 5b ) required a functional σE protein , since in similar experiments with the rpoE : : Ω-Kmr mutant SMS909 low but constant β-galactosidase activities ( approximately 10 Miller units ) , equivalent to a strain carrying the pRS1274 vector alone , were detected . 
These results demonstrate that the inappropriate overproduction of LamB can also generate signals that result in a sustained increase in σE activity . 
This is not that surprising since the artificial or inappropriate overproduction of several other outer-membrane proteins ( OMPs ) , including OmpC or OMP-like C-terminal peptides , can up-regulate σE activity through increased DegS-mediated proteolysis ( Ades et al. , 1999 ; Walsh et al. , 2003 ) . 
An interesting difference in LamB is the absence of the Y-X-F [ Tyr-X-Phe ; where X can be several different amino acids such as Tyr ( Y ) or Gln ( Q ) ] C-terminus that OmpC and several other OMPs possess . 
This is proposed to be the peptide signal/ligand that binds to the PDZ-domain of DegS , activating its protease activity ( Walsh et al. , 2003 ) . 
Interestingly , the LamB protein ( accession no . 
NP_463096 ) possesses a Q-M-E-I-W-W ( Gln-Met-Glu-Ile-Trp-Trp ) C-terminal pentapeptide that exhibits some similarity to the Φ-X-Φ [ where Φ is a hydrophobic residue such as Val ( V ) , Leu ( L ) , Ile ( I ) , Met ( M ) or Pro ( P ) ] ligand for the proposed class II PDZ-binding site ( Ponting , 1997 ; Songyang et al. , 1997 ) ; although the closest match is the M-E-I sequence two residues distal to the C-terminus of the protein . 
This suggests that LamB generated-signals may differ , or work through different pathways from the typical C-terminal peptide signal or DegS-dependent pathways reported to result in σE activation . 
Intriguingly , the C-terminal pentapeptide of the tricarboxylate-binding receptor TctC ( F-G-L-A-K , Phe-Glu-Leu-Ala-Lys ; accession no . 
AAG31205 ) and the putative dicarboxylate-binding receptors STM3169 ( Y-I-E-N-M , Tyr-Ile-Glu-Asn-Met ; accession no . 
NP_462084 ) , YiaO ( V-D-E-V-Q , Val-Asp-Glu-Val-Gln ; accession no . 
NP_462573 ) and STM4054 ( Q-T-A-K-N , Gln-Thr-Ala-Lys-Asn ; accession no . 
NP_462935 ) are also lacking the typical OMP-like C-terminal peptide sequence , again suggesting that alternative signals or DegS-independent pathways may be involved . 
A question arises as to what σE-regulated functions might be involved in this adaptation process . 
We are currently searching for these functions . 
We do not believe them to be either DegP , FkpA or SurA since we have found that in S. Typhimurium they are not regulated by σE ( or C-starvation ) under the conditions tested here ( W. J. Kenyon , A. Stevenson , S. Humphreys , M. Roberts & M. P. Spector , unpublished data ) . 
Thus , some alternative protease ( s ) , chaperone ( s ) , peptidyl-prolyl isomerase ( s ) or other function ( s ) as-yet-unidentified , would appear to be involved in the adaptation of the cell envelope to C-starvation conditions . 
Studies in E. coli ( Ades et al. , 2003 ) identified trends in σE activity occurring before , during and after the inducing stress of high temperature . 
During the initiation of the stress response , σE activity is elevated . 
The activity remains elevated during the adaptation phase while the cell adapts to the stress . 
When the stress is removed , σE activity drops below that seen in normal conditions , and then slowly rises to pre-stress levels . 
A similar scenario can be postulated for shifts from glucose to maltose , for example , which even though not typically considered a 
References 
stress do require the cells to adapt to the change in growth conditions . 
Interestingly , during Cstarvation σE levels are seen to continue to rise over a 48 -- 72 h period before levelling off ( Kenyon et al. , 2002 ) . 
We report here that shifts from glucose to maltose , citrate or succinate , but not trehalose , mannose , mannitol , fructose , glycerol , L-arabinose , galactose or melibiose , result in a sustained elevation of σE activity . 
The common feature of maltose , citrate and succinate utilization is the production of extracytoplasmic ( PP ) solute-receptors/binding proteins ( e.g. TctC ) and/or OM transport proteins or porins ( e.g. LamB ) . 
The other secondary C-sources tested required either PEP : PTS-dependent-transport systems ( e.g. trehalose , mannose , mannitol and fructose ) or non-PTS IM-transport systems ( e.g. glycerol , L-arabinose , galactose and melibiose ) . 
However , an extracytoplasmic component in their utilization systems is either absent , unknown or not expressed under the conditions tested in S. Typhimurium . 
The findings presented here support the hypothesis that σE-regulated functions are needed for the adaptation of cells to new environmental conditions that necessitate changes in the extracytoplasmic compartment of the cell , i.e. OM or periplasm . 
This implies that members of the σE regulon have functions beyond the repair or elimination of damaged extracytoplasmic proteins resulting from an environmental stress .
