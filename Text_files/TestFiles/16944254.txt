and reduction in ﬂuoroquinolone susceptibility in Salmonella spp. Relation between induction of the mar operon
and cyclohexane tolerance 
Received : October 19 , 2005 / Accepted : June 2 , 2006 
Abstract The relationship between cyclohexane tolerance and induction of the mar operon and a decrease in susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin in isolates of Sal-monella spp . 
from food and clinical isolates of Salmonella spp . 
was studied . 
We studied the inﬂuence of the mar operon using an inductor ( acetylsalicylic acid ) and we also studied the cyclohexane resistance . 
Induction was seen to produce an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of these quinolones , which suggested that there was overexpression of the AcrAB type active efﬂux systems due to induction of the mar operon . 
Cyclohexane susceptibility was not shown to be a very sensitive method for studying this process , as only 3 % ( 5/176 ) of the clinical isolates studied were cyclohexane-resistant ; most of these belonged to the Hadar serotype . 
This study conﬁrmed the participation of active efﬂux systems in the decrease in ﬂuoroquinolone susceptibility in Salmonella spp . 
Furthermore , the study has indicated that these mechanisms ( i.e. , active efﬂux systems ) are present in strains that are susceptible to the ﬂuoroquinolone compounds , so their sti-mulation may be one of the mechanisms involved in the reduction in ﬂuoroquinolone susceptibility . 
This suggests that the exposure of Salmonella spp . 
to antibiotics should be limited in order to prevent these active efﬂux systems from being activated . 
Consequently , the use of ﬂuoroquinolones , both in the treatment of humans and in veterinary practice , should be controlled and rationalized in an attempt to curb the increase in the number of strains that are resistant to these compounds . 
Key words Salmonella · Active efﬂux systems · Quinolone · Cyclohexane 
Introduction
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are one of the treatments of choice in infections due to nontyphoidal Salmonella , although many of these microorganisms exhibit reduced 1,2 susceptibility to these compounds . 
This reduced susceptibility has been associated with the activation of active efﬂux 3,4 systems in the organisms . 
The objective of this study was to characterize the role played by the mar operon in the reduced susceptibility to ﬂuoroquinolones , using acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) as an 5 -- 7 inductor of these active efﬂux systems . 
Our aim was also to study these systems by detecting strains that were cyclohexane-resistant , because this type of resistance has been associated , in Escherichia coli , with the 8 -- 10 overexpression of the acrAB , marA , soxS , or rob genes , which is involved in low levels of resistance to multiple 11 12 antibiotics and disinfectants . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial isolates from human sources
We examined 61 Salmonella enterica isolates , which had no known epidemiological relationship , and which were resistant to nalidixic acid : 21 S. Enteritidis ( [ MIC ] , 64 -- ≥ 512 mg/L ) , 18 S. Hadar ( MIC , 256 -- ≥ 512 mg/l ) , 13 S. Virchow ( MIC , 256 -- ≥ 512 mg/l ) , 7 S. Typhimurium ( MIC , 256 -- ≥ 512 mg/l ) , 1 S. Brandenburg ( MIC , 32 mg/l ) and 1 S. Monofasica ( MIC , ≥ 512 mg/l ) . 
Isolates with a nalidixic acid minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ≥ 64 mg/l had a single mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region ( QRDR ) of gyrA at codon 83 or 87 . 
The two isolates with nalidixic acid MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l did not have a mutation in this region .13 No mutations were found in the QRDR of parC ( data not published ) . 
We also studied 91 nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates : 38 S. Enteritidis ( MIC , 2 -- 8 mg/l ) , 4 S. Hadar ( MIC , 4 mg/l ) , 4

Bacterial isolates from nonhuman sources
We studied 11 nalidixic acid-resistant isolates from nonhuman sources : 10 S. Enteritidis ( MIC , 256 -- ≥ 512 mg/l ) , from chicken , turkey , other poultry , and smoked salmon , and 1 S. Hadar ( MIC , ≥ 512 mg/l ) , from minced beef . 
S. Hadar had an Asp87-Asn mutation in the QRDR of gyrA , and S. Enteritidis isolates had an Asp87-Tyr mutation in gyrA . 
Again , no mutations were found in the QRDR of parC ( data not published ) . 
We also studied 13 nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates from nonhuman sources : 7 S. Enteritidis ( MIC , 4 -- 8 mg/l ) from egg-shells , mayonnaise , and puddings made with eggs ; 4 S. Typhimurium ( MIC , 4 mg/l ) , from minced meat ; 1 S. Bredeney ( MIC , 4 mg/l ) , from fresh meat ; and 1 S. Cerro ( MIC , 4 mg/l ) from eggshells . 
Antibiotic susceptibility
Using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards ( NCCLS ) method of dilution in agar14 we determined the susceptibility of the S. enterica strains to ciproﬂoxacin ( Normon , Madrid , Spain ) and moxiﬂoxacin ( Bayer , Barcelona , Spain ) . 
E. coli 27922 was included as a control . 
We studied the MICs of ciproﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin in the presence and absence of 2.5 mM ASA . 
Cyclohexane resistance
Cyclohexane resistance was determined by the method of Asako et al. 8 Bacteria grown overnight at 30 °C were inoculated , using a multipoint inoculator , onto duplicate solid agar media in glass petri dishes . 
Each plate was ﬂooded to a depth of 6 ml with cyclohexane , sealed with Paraﬁlm , and incubated overnight at 30 °C . 
Strains that grew in the presence of cyclohexane were deemed cyclohexane-resistant . 
Results
The addition of ASA to moxiﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin was seen to produce an increase in the MICs of these quinolones , both in nalidixic acid-susceptible and nalidixic acid-resistant isolates ( Tables 1 and 2 ) , regardless of the serotype . 
The induction of resistance to the ﬂuoroquinolones produced by ASA in the active efﬂux systems of these isolates was greater in nalidixic acid-resistant isolates than in those that were nalidixic acid-susceptible ( Table 3 )

When the serotypes were compared , the least induction was seen in the Enteritidis serotype , whereas the most affected by induction was the Hadar serotype ( Table 3 ) . 
No association was found between the presence of mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and ASA activity ( Table 4 ) . 
No serotype Enteritidis isolate exhibited cyclohexane tolerance , whereas ﬁve nalidixic acid-resistant isolates of the Hadar , Typhimurium , and Virchow serotypes exhibited tolerance to this organic solvent . 
No signiﬁcant differences were seen in the nalidixic acid and ciproﬂoxacin MICs of cyclohexane-resistant and cyclohexane-susceptible isolates . 
However , the serotype Typhimurium strain that exhibited cyclohexane tolerance was the most highly resistant to ciproﬂoxacin ( Table 5 ) .

All the cyclohexane-tolerant isolates had a mutation in gyrA at Ser83-Phe or at Asp87-Asn . 
However , isolates with a mutation at Asp87-Tyr did not exhibit tolerance to cyclohexane , and were more susceptible to ciproﬂoxacin than to cyclohexane ( Table 6 ) . 
No differences were found when the results were analyzed in terms of the origin of the samples . 
Discussion
The MarRAB and SoxRS operons have been reported to regulate the expression of active efﬂux systems such as AcrAB .15,16 These operons are present in the genomes of all Salmonella strains and other enterobacteria . 
Their activation depends on the existence of stressful situations and the presence of substances such as organic solvents like cyclohexane , antibiotics , dyes , and salicylates .5 -- 7 In order to characterize these complex efﬂux systems , Baucheron et al. 17 inhibited the AcrAB operon ( with MC 207.110 ) in S. Typhimurium strains with mutations in gyrA ( Ser83-Ala and Asp87-Asn ) , parC ( Ser80-Ile ) , and gyrB ( Ser464-Phe ) and pointed out the importance of the AcrB type active efﬂux systems in the development of quinolone resistance . 
In a previous study , we also inhibited the AcrAB operon in our isolates ( with MC 207.110 ) and observed an increase in the nalidixic acid-susceptibility of all the isolates of sero-types Enteritidis , Virchow , and Typhimurium and in only 87 % of the Hadar isolates .13 In order to investigate these bacterial mechanisms in more detail , in the present study , we used an inducer and a compound that was toxic to the bacteria . 
Our data show that these mechanisms ( i.e. , active efﬂux systems ) were more active in nalidixic acid-resistant strains with reduced ﬂuoroquinolone-susceptibility , although they were also present in nalidixic acid-susceptible strains . 
Mutants that overexpress marA also exhibit tolerance to organic solvents such as cyclohexane8 ,10 and are resistant to disinfectants such as pine oil .12 Recently , triclosan resistance , due to the overexpression of marA , has been described .18 Cyclohexane-resistant Salmonella strains , of both human and animal origin , are signiﬁcantly more resistant than cyclohexane-susceptible ones to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , ciproﬂoxacin , erythromycin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , trimethoprim , cetrimide , and triclosan .11 Our data on cyclohexane resistance are comparable with 11 those of Randall et al. , who reported that cyclohexane resistance was detected in 10.6 % of the strains studied . 
Active transport mechanisms , together with mutations in topoisomerases genes , play an important role in the reduction of microbial susceptibility to ﬂuoroquinolones . 
However , the resistance of the microorganisms to these compounds is due to multiple complementary mechanisms , 19 many of which are insufﬁciently understood . 
Our study has provided data that should help to clarify the causes of the decrease in susceptibility to ﬂuoroquinolones in Salmonella spp. , a phenomenon that is becoming more and more frequent ; our data should also help to explain the greater prevalence of strains of the hadar serotype with reduced susceptibility to these compounds . 
Although the active efﬂux systems are complex , these mechanisms in susceptible bacteria are probably activated by contact with antibiotics . 
Therefore , it is necessary to control and rationalize the use of these drugs , both in the treatment of humans and in veterinary practice , in order to curb the increase in resistance .20 -- 22
