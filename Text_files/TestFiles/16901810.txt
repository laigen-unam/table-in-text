Three allylbenzenes from Asiasarum heterotropoides , methyleugenol ( 1 ) , elemicin ( 2 ) and - asaron ( 3 ) showed suppressive effects on umu gene expression of the SOS response in the Salmonella typhimurium OY1001/1A2 umu test against the mutagen 2-amino-3 ,4 - dimethyl-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] quinoline ( MeIQ ) . 
Gene expression was suppressed 70.0 , 75.9 and 81.7 % at a concentration of 0.4 mM , respectively . 
The ID50 values ( 50 % inhibition dose ) of these compounds were 0.125 , 0.098 and 0.059 mM , respectively . 
On the other hand , compounds 1 -- 3 showed weak suppressive effects of the SOS-inducing activity on activated MeIQ .

1. Introduction
Cancer is currently one of the most dreaded diseases all over the world . 
In Japan , cancer has ranked first in the cause of deaths since 1981 . 
The number of its deaths in 2003 was about 310,000 , accounting for 30.5 % of total number of deaths [ 1 ] . 
Methods for cancer detection in early stages and therapeutic remedies have greatly advanced over the last several decades , yet many cancers still remain difficult to cure . 
Cancer prevention could become an increasingly useful strategy in the war against cancer . 
Attempts to search naturally occurring antimutagens and anticarcinogen are important as one means to prevent cancer . 
Human epidemiology studies indicate that diet plays an important role in cancer development [ 2 ] . 
Heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) are mutagens derived from protein pyr-orysis , and 2-amino-3 ,4 - dimethylimidazo [ 4,5-f ] quinoline ( MeIQ ) is a HCA detected in

Although we should not ingest foods with HCAs , such as broiled fish or meat , it is difficult to eliminate them from our dietary habits . 
Through techniques to detect possible environmental carcinogens and mutagens [ 4 ] , it has been shown that ordinary diets contain many kinds of mutagens and antimutagens . 
The umu test system was developed to evaluate the genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens , using the expression of one of the SOS genes to detect DNA-damaging agents [ 5 -- 7 ] . 
The test strain Salmonella typhimurium OY1001/1A2 was constructed by introducing plasmid pCW0/1A2 : hNPR ( carrying cDNAs of CYP1A2 and NADPH-P450 reductase in the IPTG-inducible biocistronic construct ) and plasmid pOA101 ( carrying umu C 0 -- lac Z 0 fusion gene ) into S. typhimurium TA1535 . 
The usefulness of this strain for the detection of genotoxities in three HCAs namely MeIQ , IQ and MeIQx is reported [ 7 ] . 
As part of our program to discover bioactive natural compounds , we have investigated antimutagenic compounds and suppressive compounds of SOS response in plant [ 8 -- 10 ] . 
We recently have reported that three allylbenzenes , methyleugenol ( 1 ) , elemicin ( 2 ) and - asaron ( 3 ) , exhibited a suppression of the MeIQ-induced SOS response in S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 umu test [ 11 ] . 
Additional studies are demonstrated with the aim of investigating the suppressive mechanism of SOS response . 
In this article , we report the suppression of MeIQ-induced SOS response by three allylbenzenes in the S. typhimurium OY1001/1A2 umu test .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Commercially available air-dried tips of Asiasarum heterotropoides were obtained from Takasago Yakugyou Co. , Ltd. 2-Amino-3 ,4 - dimethylimidazo [ 4,5-f ] quinoline ( MeIQ ) , isopropyl - D-thiogalactosidase ( IPTG ) , - aminolevulinic acid ( - ALA ) and dimethylslufoxid ( DMSO ) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. , Osaka , Japan . 
2.2. umu Test
The umu test for detecting the chemicals-induced SOS response was carried out according to the method of Oda et al. [ 7 ] using S. typhimurium OY1001/1A2 . 
The overnight culture of bacterial strain in LB medium containing 50 mg of ampicillin/mL and 1 mg of tetracycline/mL was diluted 100-fold in TGT medium ( 1 % Bactotryptone , 0.5 % NaCl , and 0.2 % glycerol and 1 mg of tetracycline/mL ) supplemented with 1.0 mM IPTG , 0.5 mM - ALA and 250 mL of trace elements/L . 
The culture was further incubated at 37 C until the optical density at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.25 -- 0.30 . 
The culture was then dispended into 1 mL portions in tubes , and test compounds ( 10 mL , diluted DMSO ) and MeIQ ( 10 mL , 10 mg mL 1 in DMSO ) were mixed and further incubated for 3 h ( 37 C , 160 rpm ) . 
As a positive control an equivalent volume of DMSO was added instead of the test compound , whereas with negative control another equivalent volume of DMSO was added instead of both the test compound and the mutagen . 
Induction of umu C gene was determined by measuring the cellular - galactosidase activity as described by Oda et al. [ 5 ] 
2.3. Preparation of activated MeIQ
Preparation of activated MeIQ was carried out according to the method of Arimoto et al. [ 12 ] . 
2.4. Compounds 1–3
Purification and identification of the suppressive compounds 1 -- 3 were described in our previous report [ 11 ] ( figure 1 ) . 
3. Results and discussion
Compounds 1 -- 3 suppressed on average of three assays 70.0 , 75.9 and 81.7 % of the SOS-inducing activity on MeIQ at a concentration of 0.40 mM , and ID50 ( 50 % inhibition dose ) values of them were 0.125 , 0.098 and 0.059 mM . 
On the other hand , compounds 1 -- 3 showed weak ( 10.2 , 5.5 and 8.8 % at a concentration of 0.40 mM ) suppressive effects of the SOS-inducing activity on metabolically activated MeIQ ( figure 2 ) . 
MeIQ shows mutagenicity after activated in two phases ; MeIQ is metabolically activated by CYP1A2 with conversion of an amino group to a hydroxyamino group ( Phase I ) , and the hydroxyamino derivative is further activated by acethyltransferase into acetic acid , sulfuric acid and proline ( Phase II ) [ 13 ] . 
Compounds 1 -- 3 exhibited greater suppressive effects on MeIQ than on metabolically activated MeIQ . 
This result suggests that these compounds inhibited metabolism of MeIQ by CYP1A2 . 
This research showed less suppressive effects than the previous one . 
The differences between the method of the previous research and this research are having added enzyme from outside the strain S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 [ 11 ] , and having used S. typhimurium OY1001/1A2 introduced plasmid carrying cDNA of CYP1A2 . 
Since these compounds had to act with enzyme after they got into S. typhimurium OY1001/1A2 , it is supposed that the suppression fell this time . 
Compound 2 which has a methoxy group at C-5 position showed stronger suppressive effect than compound 1 which does not . 
This result indicates the methoxy group at C-5 position takes an important role in suppression of SOS response . 
Compound 3 which has a methoxy group at C-2 position showed stronger suppressive effect than compound 2 which has it at C-3 position . 
This result means having a methoxy grou at C-2 than at C-3 is more effective for the suppression of SOS response . 
These inclinations correspond to that of our previous research . 
MeIQ was reported to activate not only with CYP1A2 but also with other P450s such as CYP1A1 . 
Compounds 1 -- 3 possibly suppress those P450s . 
Thus , it is interesting to investigate further assays using strains introduced other P450s that are recently reported [ 14 ] . 
Further , methleugenol ( 1 ) and - asaron ( 3 ) have an inhibitory activity on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen ( EBV-EA ) activation . 
EBV-EA activation is an assay to detect tumor promoters , thus it suggests that methleugenol ( 1 ) and - asaron ( 3 ) might be antitumor promoters [ 15 ] . 
This result seems interesting in relation to the antimutagenic activities shown former in this study . 
We expect that the suppressive compounds of SOS response isolated from A. heterotropoides will be useful cancer chemopreventive agents . 
These compounds , however , may not exhibit their expected effects in vivo if they are adversely affected by factors such as absorption , biodisposition and metabolism after they are incorporated into human body . 
Further studies with mammalian cells in vitro or in vivo are needed to determine the efficacy of these compounds for the prevention of human cancer .
