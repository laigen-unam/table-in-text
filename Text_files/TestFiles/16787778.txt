The mechanism of binding of thyroid hormones by the transport protein transthyretin ( TTR ) in vertebrates is structurally well characterised . 
However , a homologous family of transthyretin-like proteins ( TLPs ) present in bacteria as well as eukaryotes do not bind thyroid hormones , instead they are postulated to perform a role in the purine degradation pathway and function as 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolases . 
Here we describe the 2.5 Å X-ray crystal structure of the TLP from the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella dublin , and compare and contrast its structure with vertebrate TTRs . 
The overall architecture of the homotetramer is conserved and , despite low sequence homology with vertebrate TTRs , structural differences within the monomer are restricted to flexible loop regions . 
However , sequence variation at the dimer -- dimer interface has profound consequences for the ligand binding site and provides a structural rationalisation for the absence of thyroid hormone binding affinity in bacterial TLPs : the deep , negatively charged thyroxine-binding pocket that characterises vertebrate TTR contrasts with a shallow and elongated , positively charged cleft in S. dublin TLP . 
We have demonstrated that Sdu_TLP is a 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase . 
Furthermore , using site-directed mutagenesis , we have identified three conserved residues located in this cleft that are critical to the enzyme activity . 
Together our data reveal that the active site of Sdu_TLP corresponds to the thyroxine binding site in TTRs .

Introduction
Transthyretin ( TTR ) is a tetrameric protein that is responsible for transport of thyroxine and related molecules .

Knockout studies performed in Bacillus subtilis together with biochemical investigation of the TLP from this organism suggested that TLPs function in the uricase reaction , the pathway responsible for the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin ( Figure 1 ) .7 -- 9 Specifically , a study by Lee et al. 8 suggested that TLPs catalyse the hydrolysis of 5-hydroxyisourate ( 5-HIU ) to 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimi-dazoline ( OHCU ) . 
In addition , these authors show that a related TLP from Escherichia coli also possesses the ability to hydrolyse 5-HIU . 
Finally , a recent study revealed that murine TLP is also able to function to accelerate 5-HIU hydrolysis , supporting a global role for TLPs in purine metabolism .10 Here we have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the TLP from the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella dublin ( Sdu_TLP ) . 
It is demonstrated that , like B. subtilis TLP , Sdu_TLP is able to catalyse the hydrolysis of 5-HIU to OHCU . 
Furthermore , mutagenesis studies revealed that the active site of Sdu_TLP is centred upon the region corresponding to the thyroxine binding site in TTRs and that mutation of an absolutely conserved histidine in this region abolishes activity .

Results
Structure of TLP from Salmonella dublin
The final model consists of residues 1 -- 28 and 30 -- 111 ( residue 29 is not visible in the electron density ) , two sulphate molecules and 32 water molecules . 
It has a Rcryst of 22.6 % and a Rfree of 26.1 % for all reflections between 47 and 2.5 Å . 
All residues are in the most favoured and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot . 
A summary of statistics is provided in Table 1 . 
The overall structure is consistent with the archetypal TTR fold :11,12 a prealbumin-like fold consisting of an eight-stranded β-sandwich , each sheet adopting a greek key topology , with an additional two-turn α-helix 
Values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell . 
a Agreement between intensities of repeated measurements of the same reflections and can be defined as : Σ ( Ih , i -- <Ih> ) / Σ Ih , i , where Ih , i are individual values and <Ih> is the mean value of the intensity of reflection h. b The free R factor was calculated with the 5 % of data omitted from the refinement . 
between strands E and F ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . 
The asymmetric unit consists of two protein molecules , which dimerise via intermolecular hydrogen bonds between H-strands to form an eight-stranded β-sheet ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . 
This interaction is found in all TTR crystal structures published to date . 
Tight noncrystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) restraints applied during refinement yield identical molecules in the asymmetric unit . 
A tetrameric `` dimer of dimers '' , a feature of all other TTR structures , can be generated by applying crystallographic symmetry , and consists of two dimers that associate via non-polar interactions between the loops joining strands G and H with loops joining strands A and B ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . 
Gel filtration confirmed that Sdu_TLP adopts a tetrameric form in solution ( Figure 3 ) .

Structural and sequence comparisons of Sdu_TLP with transthyretins
We compared the structure of Sdu_TLP with human ( 1F41 ) ,13 chicken ( 1TFP ) ,14 rat ( 1KGI ) ,15 and fish ( 1SN0 ) 16 TTR . 
A comparison of the relative orientations and positions of monomers within the tetrameric arrangement of Sdu_TLP , human , rat , fish and chicken TTRs reveals that human , rat and fish TTRs superimpose to within an RMSD of 1.0 Å , whereas chicken TTR and Sdu_TLP monomers show larger shifts ( up to ∼ 4 Å ) in the relative orientations of each monomer within the tetramer ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . 
Further , the total contacting surface area between molecules within the tetramer ( 5275 Å ) is 6 -- 14 % smaller compared to fish ( 5625 Å ) , human ( 5810 Å ) , chicken ( 5828 Å ) , and rat ( 6133 Å )

Assuming an approximate empirical relationship between oligomeric buried surface area and oligomer stability ,17 the smaller oligomeric surface contact area in Sdu_TLP is consistent with reports that the E. coli TLP tetramer is less stable than its vertebrate counterparts .18 Structural superposition of monomers from each species reveals that the overall fold is conserved . 
Generally , the structural deviation between Sdu_TLP and vertebrate TTRs is of the same order of magnitude to that within the set of vertebrate TTRs ( Table 2 ) . 
Exceptions and regions of plastic deformation ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) include the D strand and DE loop ( resi-dues 47 -- 57 ) and FG loop ( residues 86 -- 90 ) . 
It is noteworthy that amongst TTRs , chicken TTR shows the largest structural deviations , particularly in the α-helix and the loop connecting this helix to the F strand . 
This has been attributed to the presence of a sulphate ion that binds to the FG loop and C terminus .16 A sequence alignment of Sdu_TLP with vertebrate TTRs of known structure reveals sequence identities of 29 -- 36 % ( Table 3 and Figure 4 ( c ) ) . 
Residues that are absolutely conserved in the TLP ( but not the TTR ) family cluster in the vicinity of the dimer -- dimer interface and the region corresponding to the thyroxine binding site in TTRs ( Figure 4 ( d ) ) . 
It is generally well understood that critical functional residues in an enzyme 's active site are strongly selected for during evolution , and are therefore more likely to be conserved in comparison to non-functional residues . 
The clustering of conserved residues at the putative active site of Sdu_TLP indicates that these residues have undergone some selective pressure to maintain enzymatic function ( Figure 4 ( c ) and ( d ) ) . 
In contrast , TLP-conserved residues that are also conserved with the vertebrate TTRs are more diffusely located in the molecule , consistent with these amino acids playing structural rather than functional roles . 
Given this pattern of sequence conservation , together with the functional role of the dimer -- dimer interface in ligand binding in TTRs , we postulated that the two pockets formed by the dimer -- dimer interface in Sdu_TLP represent two active sites and contained residues crucial for 5-HIU hydrolysis . 
Nature of the putative active site of Sdu_TLP
Examination of the dimer -- dimer interface of Sdu_TLP reveals that the conserved residues His6

Proteins are stained with Coomassie blue . 
Native molecular masses obtained from mutants H6A , H95A and Y108F were the same as that of the wild-type Sdu_TLP ( data not shown ) . 
His95 and Tyr108 localise to this region . 
Comparison with human TTR reveals that Tyr108 in particular has a profound effect on the size and shape of the putative ligand-binding site ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . 
In TTRs the amino acid corresponding to residue 108 is a conserved Thr119 and substitution to a conserved Tyr in TLPs dramatically reduces the depth of this pocket . 
The conserved Leu99 in Sdu_TLP also adopts a conformation that plugs the base of the pocket in comparison to Leu110 in human TTR ( Figure 6 ( a ) ) . 
Thus whilst the TTR surface is deep and funnel-shaped , the TLP surface is more groove-like ( Figure 6 ) . 
Furthermore , the surface charge of the putative ligand-binding site of Sdu_TLP differs considerably from the TTR counterpart : residues Arg44 , Arg46 and Arg109 in particular produce an electrostatically positive groove . 
In contrast the thyroxine-binding site of vertebrate TTRs is negatively charged ( Figure 6 ( c ) and ( d ) ) . 
We were interested to investigate the role of TLP conserved residues in and around the putative active site of Sdu_TLP in 5-HIU hydrolysis . 
We chose residues that could logically perform a chemical role in catalysis and thus targeted His6 , His95 and Tyr108 for site-directed mutagenesis . 
These residues were mutated to Ala , Ala and Phe , respectively , and their role in TLP function investigated .

One milligram of wildtype TLP catalysed the hydrolysis of 10 μmol of 5-HIU in 1 min ( Figure 7 ) . 
The mutants revealed that all three residues were important for Sdu_TLP function . 
The H95A and Y108F mutations reduced 5-HIU hydrolysis activity by 90 % . 
The H6A mutation completely abolished activity ( Figure 7 ) . 
Using gel filtration we confirmed that all mutations formed tetramers indistinguishable from wild-type ( data not shown ) . 
These data demonstrate that the active site of Sdu_TLP localises to the dimer -- dimer interface and , in addition reveal that key conserved residues , in particular His6 participate in 5-HIU hydrolysis .

Discussion
The function of TTR as a hormone transport protein is well characterised , as are the misfolding events of this protein that lead to amyloidosis and disease . 
The role of TLPs , however , remains obscure . 
Recent studies have suggested that rather than playing a transport role , TLPs are enzymes that function in purine metabolism , catalysing the conversion of 5-HIU to OHCU .8,10 In order to further understand the function of TLPs we have determined the 2.5 Å X-ray crystal structure of the TLP from S. dublin . 
The molecule adopts the typical prealbumin-like fold and is similar to the known structures of vertebrate TTRs , both in terms of the arrangement of molecules in the tetramer and within the monomeric subunit . 
Despite relatively low sequence identity between Sdu_TLP and vertebrate TTRs , the structural variation is no greater than that within the vertebrate family ( Table 2 ) . 
In order to investigate the catalytic function of TLPs we mapped conserved TLP residues onto the 
Sequence Fish Human S. dublin Fish 54 36 Human 29 Chicken 33 Rat 29 Multiple sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTALW .36 structure of Sdu_TLP ( Figure 4 ( d ) ) . 
Interestingly , several highly conserved residues in the TLP family ( His6 , His95 and Tyr108 ) including the characteristic C-terminal YRGS motif , localized to the dimer -- dimer interface corresponding to the thyroxine-binding site in vertebrate TTRs . 
Examination of this region in TLP immediately revealed a structural basis for the inability of TLP to bind thyroxine in an analogous fashion to TTRs . 
Specifically , in TLPs the corresponding cavity is positively rather than negatively charged , and is less deep , primarily as a result of substitution of Thr to Tyr at residue 108 ( Sdu_TLP numbering ) and a change in conformation of Leu99 . 
However , the presence of highly conserved residues led us to test the hypothesis that this cleft may represent the active site of Sdu_TLP and we therefore investigated this region using site-directed mutagenesis of plausible catalytic residues ( based upon physiochemical characteristics ) . 
Our data reveal that His6 , at the top of the cavity is absolutely required for catalytic activity ( Figure 7 ) . 
In contrast , mutation of His95 and Tyr108 reduced substantially ( by 90 % ) , but did not abolish activity . 
None of the mutations affected the tetrameric assembly of the molecule . 
These results clearly demonstrate that the active site of Sdu_TLP is centered in the groove at the dimer -- dimer interface and that key conserved residues in this region perform a functional rather than structural role . 
The more open groove or channel in Sdu_TLP , indicated by a smaller dimer -- dimer contact surface area compared to TTRs , is consistent with a classic enzyme site topology , allowing access and egress of substrates and products . 
This is in stark contrast to the deep , secluded thyroxine-binding pocket of TTRs that provide a tight binding , protective environment consistent with a role as hormone-binding protein . 
The residues that we mutated are 100 % conserved across all TLP sequences ( from all kingdoms ) .4 It is therefore likely that TLPs from other organisms are also able to hydrolyse 5-HIU and that this activity represents a general function for this branch of the family . 
Previously it has been postulated that TTR and TLP arose as a result of an early gene duplication event .4 -- 6 Indeed , classical TTRs are only found in vertebrates . 
In contrast , bioinformatic investigation reveals that TLPs are more widely distributed with members in prokaryotes , plants , lower eukaryotes , invertebrates and vertebrates . 
Thus it is reasonable to suggest that the transthy-retin-like fold functioned originally in purine me-tabolism and that a non-enzymatic transport function arose later in evolution .

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification
Sdu_TLP was synthesised and purified as described .4 Briefly , the Sdu_TLP gene was cloned into the expression vector pET11a ( Novagen ) , which was then transformed into Rosetta BL21 cells . 
Protein synthesis was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed by sonication in 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) containing 100 μg / ml lysozyme . 
Soluble protein was isolated by centrifugation of the sonicate at 15,000 g for 10 min 
Soluble protein was dialysed against 50 mM Hepes ( pH 6.95 ) overnight , before application onto a HiTrap SP ion exchange column ( GE Healthcare ) . 
Sdu_TLP was eluted with 50 mM Hepes ( pH 6.95 ) containing 0.5 M NaCl . 
Fractions were pooled , concentrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.8 ) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.002 % ( w/v ) sodium azide and then applied to a Superose-12 10/30 size-exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) . 
The Sdu_TLP was purified on the Superose-12 column as a tetramer ( Figure 2 ) . 
All purification steps were performed at 4 °C . 
The purity of protein preparation was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining ; 19 the identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing ; the molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry and the concentration was determined by Bradford20 using BSA as standards as described .4 
Mutagenesis
Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the Sdu_TLP sequence using Quick-change mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . 
The amino acid substitutions were : H6A , H95A and Y108F . 
The primers used were : H6A : forward primer 5 ′ - CAT ATG ATT CTC AGC GTA GCG ATT CTC GAT CAG CAA AC-3 ′ ; reverse primer 5 ′ - GTT TGC TGA TCG AGA ATC GCT ACG CTG AGA ATC ATA TG-3 ′ .

All mutant Sdu_TLPs were prepared as described for the wild-type protein . 
Hydrolysis of 5-hydroxyisourate by Sdu_TLP
Enzyme assays were performed using a modified method of Lee et al. 8 Briefly , 50 μM uric acid was added to 0.05 units/ml uricase ( Sigma ) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.8 ) . 
When the amount of 5-HIU had reached a maximum ( approximately 3 min ) 0.04 μM Sdu_TLP was added . 
Reactions were performed in 1 ml quartz cuvettes at 22 °C . 
The amount of 5-HIU was monitored at 312 nm throughout the experiment . 
The rate of 5-HIU hydrolysis was calculated with the extinction coefficient 8500 M − 1 cm − 1.7 The experiment was repeated using the Sdu_TLP mutants . 
Figure 7 .

0.05 units/ml uricase was equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.8 ) for 3 min . 
The reaction was commenced with the addition of 50 μM uric acid . 
The appearance of 5-HIU was monitored spectrophotometrically at 312 nm . 
The amount of 5-HIU peaked after approximately 3 min and began spontaneous decomposition if left unperturbed . 
Addition of 0.04 μM wild-type Sdu_TLP resulted in the rapid hydrolysis of 5-HIU ( 10 μmol / min per mg TLP ) . 
Addition of equimolar amounts of H95A and Y108F mutant Sdu_TLPs resulted in reduced hydrolysis ( 1.2 μmol / min per mg TLP ; activity reduced by 90 % ) . 
The H6A mutation abolished hydrolytic activity ( negligible hydrolysis of 0.1 μmol / min per mg TLP ; activity reduced by 99 % ) . 
Crystallisation
Sdu_TLP was concentrated to 5 -- 7 mg/ml ; an equimolar amount of allantoin ( 50 mM in 1 M NaOH ) was added and left to incubate at 4 °C for 1 h prior to crystallisation . 
Initial screening was carried out using a Cartesian Honeybee ™ crystallisation robot ( Genomic Solutions , USA ) . 
Optimi-zation of crystallisation was then performed using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method . 
Hexagonal crystals were obtained in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate ( pH 6.0 ) , 0.2 M MgCl2 , 20 % ( w/v ) polyethylene glycol 3350 at 22 °C after three to five days . 
The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid N2 prior to data collection with 15 % glycerol as the cryoprotectant . 
X-ray data collection, structure determination and refinement
The crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution and belong to space group P6 , with unit cell dimensions of a = 94.70 Å , b = 94.70 Å , c = 57.38 Å , consistent with two molecules per asymmetric unit . 
The data were merged and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA .21,22 Subsequent crystallographic and structural analysis was performed using the CCP4i interface23 to the CCP4 suite ,24 unless stated otherwise . 
Five percent of the dataset was flagged for calculation of the free R factor ( Rfree ) with neither a sigma , nor a low-resolution cut-off applied to the data . 
A summary of statistics is provided in Table 1 . 
The structure was solved using the molecular replacement method and the program PHASER .25 A search model was constructed from an ensemble of the closest four structural homologues ( pdb identifier 1GKO , 1IJN , 1SN0 , 1SOK ) 16,26 -- 28 identified using the FFAS server .29 Structures were structurally superimposed using MUSTANG ,30 and a `` mixed '' model consisting of conserved side-chains ( all other non alanine/glycine residues truncated at Cγ atom ) was created using the SCRWL server .31 Two outstanding solutions having Z-scores of 8.9 and 15.9 were produced , and packed well within the unit cell . 
Together with the unbiased features in the initial electron density maps , the correctness of the molecular replacement solution was confirmed . 
Structure refinement and model building proceeded using the best matching model in the ensemble ( 1SN0 ) . 
Maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC ,32 incorporating translation , libration , and screw-rotation displacement ( TLS ) refinement was carried out , employing bulk solvent correction ( Babinet model with mask ) . 
Throughout refinement , tight NCS-restraints were imposed on the two molecules . 
All model building and structural validation was carried out using COOT .33 Water molecules were added to the model using ARP/wARP34 when the Rfree reached 30 % . 
Solvent molecules were retained only if they had acceptable hydrogen bonding geometry contacts of 2.5 -- 3.5 Å with protein atoms or with existing solvent , and were in good 2Fo -- Fc and Fo -- Fc electron density . 
Structural analysis
PYMOL35 was used to produce Figures 2 , 4 ( a ) , 4 ( b ) , 4 ( d ) , 5 , 6 ( a ) , and 6 ( b ) . 
CCP4MG24 was used to calculate electrostatic surfaces and to produce Figure 6 ( c ) and ( d ) . 
Structures were superimposed using the program MUSTANG .30 Accessible surface areas were calculated using the CCP4 program AREAIMOL .24
