Objectives : To determine if one passage of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in the presence of farm disinfectants selected for mutants with decreased susceptibility to disinfectants and/or antibiotics . 
Methods : Eight Salmonella Typhimurium strains including ﬁeld isolates and laboratory mutants were exposed to either a tar oil phenol ( PFD ) disinfectant , an oxidizing compound disinfectant ( OXC ) , an aldehyde based disinfectant ( ABD ) or a dairy sterilizer disinfectant ( based on quaternary ammonium biocide ) in agar . 
The susceptibility of mutants obtained after disinfectant exposure to antibiotics and disinfectants was determined as was the accumulation of norﬂoxacin . 
The proteome of SL1344 after exposure to PFD and OXC was analysed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . 
Results : Strains with either acrB or tolC inactivated were more susceptible to most disinfectants than other strains . 
The majority ( 3/5 ) of mutants recovered after disinfectant exposure required statistically signiﬁcantly longer exposure times to disinfectants than their parent strains to generate a 5 log kill . 
Small decreases in antibiotic susceptibility were observed but no mutants were multiply antibiotic-resistant ( MAR ) . 
Notably exposure to ABD decreased susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin in some strains . 
Mutants with increased disinfectant tolerance were able to survive and persist in chicks as well as in parent strains . 
Analysis of proteomes revealed signiﬁcantly increased expression of the AcrAB -- TolC efﬂux system after PFD exposure . 
Conclusions : Data presented demonstrate that efﬂux pumps are required for intrinsic resistance to some disinfectants and that exposure to disinfectants can induce expression of the AcrAB -- TolC efﬂux system , but that single exposure was insufﬁcient to select for MAR strains . 
Keywords : MAR , efﬂux , proteomics , biocide resistance 
Introduction
In two recent studies , we demonstrated that growth of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli with subinhibitory concentrations of farm disinfectants led to a small but statistically signiﬁcant increase in isolation of multiply antibiotic-resistant ( MAR ) strains , which were detected when subsequently exposed to cyclohexane or antibiotics . 
In E. coli and S. enterica serovar 1,2 Typhimurium ( hereafter referred to as Salmonella Typhimurium ) , 
MAR is associated with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics such as b-lactams , chloramphenicol , ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracyclines , increased tolerance to organic solvents and decreased susceptibility to disinfectants such as pine oil . 
In E. coli , over-3 -- 5 expression of the efﬂux pump acrAB and regulators marA and soxS can all lead to MAR. . 
Although the mechanisms of MAR in 2 S. enterica are not so clearly deﬁned as for E. coli , the same resistance phenotype is seen in isolates from farms and farm animals .

In recent years , there have been increasing concerns that disinfectant exposure may help drive selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria . 
Disinfectants are often a mixture of active 6,7 compounds and as a result usually have multiple , intracellular targets , therefore it has been proposed that disinfectant resistance is unlikely to arise from a single mutational event as can occur with antibiotic resistance . 
Consequently , for high-level disinfec-8 tant resistance to arise as a result of target site mutations repeated selection events and alteration of a number of target proteins may be necessary . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of multidrug xenobiotic efﬂux transporters ( e.g. AcrAB -- TolC ) with broad substrate speciﬁcity can confer decreased resistance to antibiotics , dyes , disinfectants and detergents . 
The selection of MAR is a concern as such strains may 9 be able to act as a stepping stone to high-level resistance in E. 1,4 -- 5 coli and S. enterica . 
In our previous studies , however , there were essentially two 1,2 selection stages , the ﬁrst being growth in subinhibitory concentrations of disinfectants and the second being plating the strains on either media with 4 MIC of antibiotics or media overlaid with cyclohexane . 
We were not able to isolate strains with reduced susceptibility to the farm disinfectants themselves , nor were we able to isolate MAR mutants after exposure to farm disinfectants , without the additional exposure to either antibiotics or cyclohexane . 
In a farm environment it is possible that bacteria will be exposed to both antibiotics and disinfectants and that over time multiple exposures may occur , so we were interested in whether limited exposure to farm disinfectants alone could select antibiotic-resistant strains . 
The aim of this study , therefore , was to select strains of Salmonella Typhimurium from agar containing four different commonly used farm disinfectants and to compare the phenotype of mutant and parent strains with respect to efﬂux , anti-biotic and disinfectant susceptibility , growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of disinfectants , protein expression and the ability to survive and persist in chicks . 
We attempted to select mutants with increased disinfectant tolerance from a relevant panel of strains including ciproﬂoxacin-resistant and - susceptible isolates , Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT104 isolates as well as from deﬁned mutants in which efﬂux pump genes have been inactivated .

Materials and methods
Strains, media and chemicals
The panel of strains used to select for disinfectant tolerant mutants comprised a mixture of wild-type and laboratory mutants as well as animal isolates . 
As ciproﬂoxacin resistance is a problem in Salmonella Typhimurium , ciproﬂoxacin-resistant mutants and 10 isolates were included , also representative DT104 isolates were included in the panel . 
In order to analyse the contribution of active efﬂux to intrinsic and high-level disinfectant tolerance , mutants lacking either acrB or tolC were also included . 
E. coli I113 ( NCTC 10418 ) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 were used as susceptible control strains for all susceptibility testing experiments . 
E. coli AG100 and AG102 were used as controls for cyclohexane tolerance assays . 
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and were 25 routinely cultured on Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) agar and in LB broth unless stated otherwise . 
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich ( Poole , Dorset , UK ) except for ciproﬂoxacin , which was kindly donated by Bayer ( Newbury , Berkshire , UK ) . 
The farm disinfectants used were a tar oil phenol ( PFD ) which was a blend of high boiling point tar acids and organic acids , an oxidizing compound based disinfectant ( OXC ) , an aldehyde based disinfectant ( ABD ) and a dairy sterilizing disinfectant ( DSD ) which comprised a quaternary ammonium biocide , non-ionic surfactant and excipients . 
Selection of mutants after single exposure to disinfectants
Mutants were selected as previously described . 
Parent strains were 11 grown overnight in antibiotic-free broth , concentrated by centrifugation and re-suspended in sterile broth to give a range of inocula ( 10 -- 10 cfu/mL ) . 
Agar plates containing disinfectants at 2 the 6 10 MIC ( v/v ; Table 2 ) were inoculated with 100 mL ( 10 -- 10 cfu ) of 5 9 each cell suspension and incubated at 378C in air for up to 7 days . 
Ten colonies with the typical size and morphology of the original strain were chosen randomly from each selecting plate and subcultured onto disinfectant-free media and retained for further study of the mechanism of resistance . 
Calculation of disinfectant exposure times required for a 5 log kill
Disinfectant activity was quantiﬁed by determining the ability of a disinfectant to reduce the viable numbers of a suspension of bacteria . 
The decimal reduction time ( D value ) is the time required for a speciﬁed concentration of disinfectant to lead to a 1 log ( 90 % ) reduction in viable numbers . 
In this study , the ability of each dis-12 infectant used to kill mutants with decreased susceptibility was determined using an assay based on the European suspension test which requires a 5 log ( 99.999 % ) kill ( EN1040 ) . 
Initial experiments deﬁned the concentrations of each disinfectant required to give a 5 log reduction in viable numbers of bacteria within 30 min . 
These conditions were then used to compare the time required for a 5 log kill for mutant and parent strains . 
For each strain , an overnight culture in LB broth was diluted to 5 10 cfu/mL , 1 mL of this 8 suspension was then added to 8 mL of test disinfectant solution and 1 mL of sterile water . 
At 5 min time intervals , 0.5 mL aliquots were removed and added to universal tubes containing 0.5 mL of sterile water and 4.5 mL of neutralizing buffer . 
Each suspension created 12 in this way was serially diluted in sterile water and aliquots plated 8 onto LB agar plates , which were incubated overnight at 37 C before colony numbers were recorded . 
Viable counts were performed in parallel from the original cultures used in order to allow enumeration of the numbers of cells killed after disinfectant treatment . 
Viable count data were also used to correct for differences in sizes of the original inocula within each experiment in order to allow comparison of data from parent and mutant strains . 
Data were ana-lysed using Excel ( Microsoft , USA ) to calculate means and standard deviations for each strain . 
Differences between strains were analysed for statistical signiﬁcance using the Student 's t-test . 
MICs and cyclohexane resistance
Organic solvent ( cyclohexane and hexane ) tolerance was determined as previously described . 
MIC testing of antibiotics and farm disin-4 fectants used the BSAC agar doubling dilution method . 
13 
Cell envelope analysis
The expression of major outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide was investigated as described previously and patterns com-14 pared between parent and mutant strains . 
All strains were also visualized microscopically in order to detect any ﬁlamentation or other gross morphological changes . 
Sequencing of quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE
The QRDRs of gyrA , gyrB , parC and parE from ABD-1 with crossresistance to ciproﬂoxacin were ampliﬁed and sequenced as previously described . 
15 
In vitro analysis of growth kinetics
The ability of parent and disinfectant tolerant strains to grow in the presence of concentrations of disinfectants at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations was monitored in LB broth using a FLUOstar OPTIMA ( BMG LABTECH , UK ) . 
Sterile LB broth ( 100 mL ) was dispensed into sterile microtitre trays and inoculated with overnight culture of each strain to give a ﬁnal inoculum of 4 % v/v . 
Readings were taken every 10 min of the optical density of each well ( scanned at 600 nm ) in the microtitre trays over the 24 h time period and results recorded automatically . 
Each strain was analysed in tri-plicate wells on at least three separate occasions to give nine data sets for analysis . 
Additionally , each strain was challenged with either 0.5 or the MIC of the selective biocide for the parent after 2 h of growth ( mid-logarithmic growth phase ) in order to determine whether the inhibitory ability of each biocide was reduced in mutants , respective to parent strains . 
Data were analysed using Excel ( Microsoft , USA ) to calculate means and standard deviations for each strain . 
Differences between strains were analysed for stat-istical signiﬁcance using the Student 's t-test . 
Accumulation of norﬂoxacin
As it is a good substrate of the AcrAB -- TolC system and easily detected the accumulation of norﬂoxacin by each strain in the pre-16 sence and absence of CCCP ( carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhy-drazone , which dissipates the proton motive force and hence acts as an inhibitor of active efﬂux ) was directly measured as previously described .

Effect of disinfectant exposure on the proteome of SL1344
Protein expression was assessed in order to determine bacterial stress response after disinfectant treatment . 
Proteomes were prepared in triplicate from SL1344 with and without exposure to PFD ( 0.04 % , v/v ) and OXC ( 0.15 % , w/v ) disinfectants for 90 min . 
Protein extracts were prepared and analysed by 2D-LC-MS as n described previously . 
The relative abundance of the proteins 17,18 was compared using the spectrum count method following pub-19 lished guidelines and denotes the number of peptide counts 20 ( ` hits ' ) detected for each protein . 
Protein expression was given as a ratio of the spectrum count . 
Expression analysis was limited to only those proteins common to all three replicates from control or disinfectant-treated cultures . 
Proteomes were compared using Microsoft Access and Excel . 
The statistical signiﬁcance of percen-tage changes in protein expression was determined using the two-tailed Student 's t-test .

Survival of mutant strains in chicks
Chick studies were performed in a similar manner to previous studies . 
In brief , at three weeks of age , each group of birds was 21 infected by intra-gastric gavage with 10 cfu per bird with either 6 strain DSD-1 or PFD-1 or OXC-1 ( Table 2 ) . 
For each of these groups of birds , there was a control group of birds infected with the respective parent strain ( Table 2 ) . 
Cloacal swabs were taken from each bird twice weekly for up to 27 days after inoculation using pre-weighed swabs , which were weighed after swabbing so that results gave cfu/g of caecal contents . 
Swabs were plated onto Rambach agar ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , which was incubated overnight at 378C . 
As chicks were kept together in groups , for statistical analysis , individual birds were regarded as independent units that did not interact with any other birds in the same group as far as the infection is concerned . 
With this assumption , the non-parametric Mann -- Whitney was used to compare the mean log counts of the parent and disinfectant tolerant strains for each day post-infection . 
All animal studies were conducted under the jurisdiction of the Animals Scientiﬁc Procedures Act ( 1986 ) and were reviewed by the local ethics review committee . 
Results
Mutants with increased disinfectant tolerance were selected
Disinfectant tolerant mutants were selected from a range of strains ( Tables 1 and 2 ) at a frequency between 1 10 and 29 1 10 . 
It was only possible to select disinfectant tolerant 210 strains from agar containing 2 MIC of disinfectants , not from agar with 4 or higher multiples of disinfectant MICs . 
In general , multiple mutants with an identical phenotype were selected from each parent , when this was the case , data for one representative mutant has been displayed ( Table 2 ) . 
Disinfectant, antibiotic and organic solvent susceptibility
L108 ( SL1344 , tolC : : aph ) and L643 ( SL1344 , acrB : : aph ) were both hyper-susceptible to the phenolic ( PFD ) , quaternary ammonium ( DSD ) and aldehyde ( ABD ) based disinfectants with 8-fold increases in susceptibility to these agents with respect to SL1344 , but were not more susceptible to the oxidative disinfectant ( OXC ) . 
There was little variation in the susceptibility of the other strains to disinfectants ; the ABD was signiﬁcantly ( ~ 10-fold ) more active than the other agents tested ( Table 2 ) . 
Using the European suspension test ( EN1040 ) , three of the ﬁve mutants required statistically signiﬁcantly longer times to generate a 5 log reduction in viability than their respective parents ( Table 2 ) . 
OXC-1 required longer exposure to OXC for a 5 log kill ( Figure 1 ) and the MIC of OXC was one-dilution higher in this mutant than its parent ( Table 2 ) . 
Mutants isolated after exposure to ABD displayed a 4-fold increase in MIC of ciproﬂoxacin as well as requiring longer exposure to ABD for a 5 log kill ( Table 2 ) . 
Mutants obtained after exposure to DSD were more resistant to exposure to DSD as seen by MIC ( DSD-1 ) or increased time required to obtain a 5 log kill ( DSD-2 ) . 
Interestingly , DSD-2 was obtained from L108 ( tolC : : aph ) after exposure to DSD and was signiﬁcantly more resistant than its parent to DSD but not to the other agents tested where it retained the hyper-susceptibility seen in L108 after inactivation of tolC ( Table 2 ) . 
Mutant PFD-1 obtained after exposure to PFD showed an increased tolerance to chloramphenicol , ethidium bromide and kanamycin but was not more tolerant to disinfectants ; in fact this mutant actually required a shorter PFD contact time to provoke a 5 log reduction in viable cell numbers , which is an unexplained observation . 
No increased organic solvent tolerance was detected for any of the disinfectant-selected mutants compared with their respect-ive parent strains ( data not shown ) . 
Growth kinetics and accumulation assays
Accumulation of norﬂoxacin was unchanged for all mutants apart from ABD-1 ( derived from L358 after exposure to ABD ) , which accumulated signiﬁcantly less norﬂoxacin than their parent ( Figure 2 ) . 
The addition of CCCP increased norﬂoxacin accumulation in ABD-1 mutant indicating that the reduced accumulation seen in these strains is likely to be a consequence of active efﬂux . 
None of the disinfectant-selected mutants was compromised in their ability to grow in LB broth relative to their parents in the absence of disinfectant . 
The disinfectant-selected mutants were more resistant to the addition of disinfectants to the media than their respective parent strains , including those strains for which the MIC of the selective disinfectant had remained unchanged when compared with the parent . 
DSD-selected mutant DSD-2 was able to grow signiﬁcantly ( P . 
0.01 ) better upon both the addition of 0.1 % and 0.2 % DSD to the media ( Figure 3 ) . 
ABD-selected mutant ABD-1 and OXC-selected mutant OXC-1 both grew signiﬁcantly ( P . 
0.01 ) faster than their parents when challenged with 0.5 or the MIC of ABD or OXC ( data not shown ) . 
No signiﬁcant differences were observed between PFD-selected mutant PFD-1 parent L357 in disinfectant-free broth or when exposed to 0.5 the MIC of PFD . 
However , PFD-1 did grow signiﬁcantly ( P . 
0.05 ) better when challenged with the MIC of PFD ( data not shown ) . 
Mechanism of increased ciproﬂoxacin resistance in ABD mutants
The frequency of mutant selection of ABD-1 ( and other mutants selected at the same time from the same parent with an identical ciproﬂoxacin resistance phenotype ) was consistent with a one - step point mutation . 
The parent of ABD-1 , L358 , carries a Ser-83 ! 
Phe substitution within GyrA ; despite the increased resistance to ciproﬂoxacin in ABD-1 , no additional changes were found in the QRDRs of any of the topoisome-rase genes investigated . 
Investigation of the LPS and OMP proﬁles of all three ABD mutants indicated no changes compared with L358 demonstrating that loss of porins was not responsible for increased ciproﬂoxacin resistance in these strains . 
The accumulation data ( Figure 2 ) suggests that increased efﬂux activity alone is responsible for this increased ciproﬂoxacin resistance . 
Different disinfectants provoke different changes in the proteome of SL1344
As the MIC data ( Table 2 ) suggested that PFD , DSD and ABD are subject to active efﬂux but OXC is not , the effect of the PFD ( 0.04 % , v/v ) and the OXC ( 0.15 % , w/v ) disinfectants on the proteome of SL1344 was determined . 
Treatment with both disinfectants had no signiﬁcant effect on the total number of proteins detected . 
For the PFD experiment , a mean number of 360 proteins were detected in both the treatment and control ( no disinfectant ) and 424 proteins were detected in the OXC experiment ( Table 3 ) . 
The expression of 12 and 32 proteins were signiﬁcantly ( P . 
0.05 ) altered following treatment with the PFD and OXC disinfectants , respectively ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . 
The pattern of protein expression was very different after exposure to the two disinfectants . 
The PFD disinfectant signiﬁcantly ( P , 0.05 ) increased expression of proteins consistent with efﬂux being required for disinfectant tolerance including the AcrAB / TolC efﬂux pump , EmrA another multidrug efﬂux pump protein and others associated with detoxiﬁcation of hydroperoxides ( AhpC and AhpE ) and pyruvate dehydrogenase ( AceE and AceF ) ( Table 4 ) . 
The OXC disinfectant increased expression of a range of proteins including RpsC , a 30S ribosomal subunit ; HtrA , a periplasmic serine protease ; and FhuA , a transporter for ferrichrome ( Table 5 ) . 
Both disinfectants increased expression of PqiB the paraquat-inducible protein .

ability to colonize and persist in chicks ( data not shown ) . 
All groups of birds were still shedding ~ 10 cfu of Salmonella/g of 6 caecal contents at the end of the experiments , 27 days after infection indicating that mutants colonized and persisted as well as parent strains . 
Discussion
In this study , mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium with a stable increased tolerance to disinfectants were selected from a range of strains at a frequency which suggests one mutational event and that a single target of each disinfectant has been altered in each mutant . 
As the disinfectants used all have multiple modes of antibacterial action , it is likely that selection of mutants highly resistant to disinfectants will require multiple exposures to disinfectant and successive selection events . 
The MIC data indicated that an intact AcrAB -- TolC system contributes to intrinsic resistance to PFD , DSD and ABD but not OXC . 
The proteomic data support this conclusion with increased levels of AcrAB -- TolC and EmrA detected after exposure to PFD but not after exposure to OXC , which would appear to be insensitive to active efﬂux . 
The selection of mutant DSD-2 ( selected from L109 , tolC : : aph ) with a level of tolerance to DSD similar to most strains , although it lacks a functional tolC gene , suggests that another efﬂux system may compensate for the loss of TolC in this mutant and that secondary transpor-ters , other than AcrAB -- TolC , may also be able to transport DSD . 
These data suggest that different disinfectants may differ with respect to their potential to select for mutants which overexpress efﬂux pumps . 
None of the disinfectant-selected mutants was MAR , indicating that short , single exposure to these agents was insufﬁcient to select for such mutants . 
In previous studies , disinfectant exposure followed by antibiotic exposure did lead to selection of MAR. . 
However , the pattern of proteins whose expression was 1,2 increased by exposure to the PFD was consistent with those previously associated with MAR , including increased expression 1 -- 5 of AcrAB -- TolC . 
These data suggest that there is a link between disinfectant exposure and the major effectors of MAR. . 
These ﬁrst-step mutants with a low level of disinfectant resistance could act as a stepping stone to MAR strains . 
The pattern of increased protein expression after treatment with OXC and PFD was distinct reﬂecting the different active constituents of each disinfectant . 
Any overlap was limited to increased expression of PqiB the paraquat-inducible protein which is a member of the soxRS regulon and therefore may have roles in both response to oxidative stress and regulation of acrAB . 
Although PFD induced expression of several efﬂux proteins , OXC increased expression of different proteins including NfnB ( dihydropteridine reductase/oxygen-insensitive NAD ( P ) H nitroreductase ) and AhpF ( alkyl hydroperoxide reductase , F52a subunit ; detoxiﬁcation of hydroperoxides ) , which have been associated with resistance to hydrogen peroxide , this is likely to reﬂect a stress response provoked by the oxidizing compounds contained by the OXC . 
The increase in the MIC of ciproﬂoxacin seen for mutant ABD-1 , after exposure to ABD , is likely to be a result of decreased accumulation of ciproﬂoxacin in these mutants , as no topoisomerase substitutions in addition to the Ser-83 ! 
Phe substitution present in the parent or alterations in porin expression were found . 
The accumulation of norﬂoxacin was reduced in these strains compared with their parent and the susceptibility of these strains to CCCP suggests that active efﬂux is responsible for the reduced norﬂoxacin accumulation observed . 
No decreased susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin was detected in any of the other mutants selected from other strains after exposure to ABD ( data not shown ) suggesting that the GyrA substitution in L358 may predispose selection of higher level ciproﬂoxacin resistance as seen in ABD-1 . 
The potential for disinfectants to drive resistance to ciproﬂoxacin is a real concern and may 6 provide a selective pressure for the selection or maintenance of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant strains in the farm environment in the absence of ciproﬂoxacin itself . 
None of the disinfectant-selected mutants was compromised in their ability to grow in vitro and was better able to tolerate challenge with disinfectants . 
The ﬁtness of disinfectant tolerant strains in chicks was not compromised . 
A key consideration for assessing the risk that any mutants may present is their ability to survive in different food production environments . 
These may include the general farm environment , and associated speciﬁc niches , and the animals themselves where different selective pressures may apply . 
The present observation that the ﬁtness of the disinfectant tolerant mutants was not compromised in chickens is a cause for concern as survival in birds would enable both persistence on the farm and transit through the food chain .
