Although immunity to self-antigen is difficult to elicit because of immune tolerance or ignorance , various reports have shown that immunologic ignorance to AFP can be broken by immunization with DNA vaccines or peptide 5 6,7 vaccines . 
As such , AFP can serve as an attractive target for immunotherapy against HCC . 
Recent clinical trials that used AFP-derived peptides emulsified in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant showed that human T-cell repertoire is capable of recognizing AFP although no tumor response has been recorded yet . 
8 It has been reported that AFP-specific T-cell immunity can be generated by multiple systems including injection of plasmid DNA delivery , dendritic cells ( DCs ) engineered to 5 express AFP , and plasmid prime-adenovirus boost vacci-9 nation . 
However , as a cancer prevention measure for a 10 large number of patients , these approaches are either cumbersome or expensive . 
Induction of an effective anti-gen-specific immunity by DNA vaccines against self-antigen requires optimization of the vaccine design , including effective modalities of vaccine delivery , powerful adjuvants , and optimal antigen processing . 
This can be achieved by an oral DNA vaccine delivery system using attenuated 11,12 Salmonella typhimurium . 
Oral DNA vaccination wit attenuated S. typhimurium harboring cancer-specific anti-gen-expressing plasmid was proven to be effective in DNA delivery and subsequent induction of immunity against antigens encoded by the plasmid . 
In addition , oral 13 DNA vaccination with attenuated S. typhimurium provides noninvasive administration with an advantage of easy preparation compared to injection method . 
In this study , we applied an alternative mode of DNA delivery in an attempt to break immune tolerance to HCC self-antigens . 
Attenuated S. typhimurium engineered to carry HCC-specific self-antigen murine a-fetoprotein ( mAFP ) effectively protected experimental mice against mAFPexpressing tumor via activation of T-cell immunization .

Antitumor vaccination therapies using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium carrying plasmid DNA encoding tumor-associated antigens are currently under preclinical development . 
In the present study , we first established a useful method to facilitate in vivo monitoring of attenuated S. typhimurium uptake using a bioluminescent lux gene operon plasmid . 
Following transformation with the lux gene operon construct , mice were fed with various amounts of attenuated S. typhimurium-lux to monitor in vivo clearance 
over a period of 24 h . 
We found that the ingested attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells were almost cleared out 9 h postfeeding , as judged by a significant decrease in bioluminescence . 
We further examined the therapeutic efficacy of vaccination using attenuated S. typhimurium carrying the mouse a-fetoprotein ( AFP ) gene against a cancer line CT26-murine a-feto protein ( mAFP ) that stably expresses AFP and mouse hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) Hepa1-6 . 
Attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccine was found 
to promote protective immunity against both CT26-mAFP and Hepa1-6 tumor cells growth . 
The oral DNA vaccine significantly increased the life span of tumor-challenged mice in both tumor models . 
Together , these results suggest that vaccination with the attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccine that carries the AFP gene could be a promising strategy to prevent HCC development .

Introduction 
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is one of the most common and malignant tumors in the world . 
The global 1 pandemic of hepatitis B and C virus infections are the major causes of HCC . 
Surgery and liver transplantation are the 2 potential curative treatments for HCC , but not suitable for most HCC patients because of late stage diagnosis or concurrent liver cirrhosis . 
Therefore , novel immunother-1 ,2 apeutic strategies for HCC are needed and being developed . 
3 a-fetoprotein ( AFP ) is an HCC-specific antigen frequently overexpressed in HCC or in embryonal malignancies . 
In contrast , AFP expression in healthy 4 
Materials and methods DNA transformation of S. typhimurium
Attenuated S. typhimurium strain was kindly provided by Dr Bruce Stocker ( Stanford University ) and Dr R Xiang ( The Scripps Research Institute ) . 
The plasmid-contain-14 ing lux gene operon was obtained from Dr A Szalay ( University of Wuerzburg , Germany ) . 
Electroporation 15 was used to transform the lux gene operon plasmid and pGLmAFP into the attenuated S. typhimurium . 
Freshly prepared bacterial ( 1 10 cells ) were mixed with 1 8 mg DNA and electroporated at 2.5 kV , 25 mF , and 200 O in an electroporator ( BTX Electroporation System ) . 
After electroporation , the bacteria were removed and cultured with 1 ml SOB broth medium for 30 min at 371C . 
Transformed culture ( 100 ml ) was then plated onto LB plates with 50 mg/ml ampicillin . 
Resistant colonies containing the DNA vaccine gene were cultured and stored at 1 70 C after confirmation of coding sequence . 
Monitoring attenuated S. typhimurium using bioluminescent gene
Attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells were cultured in LB medium at 371C with or without the selection antibiotics overnight . 
For in vitro detection , different amounts of cells were plated in a blacken 96 well ( Falcon ) and total photon emission from each sample was captured using an IVIS camera system ( Xenogen Corp. ) and was quantified using the LivingImage software package ( Xenogen Corp. ) . 
Bacteria collected at different time point were quantified using the method described above . 
For in vivo detection , mice fed with various dosages 6 9 ( 1 10 to 1 10 ) of attenuated S. typhimurium-lux were anesthetized and photon collection was carried out for 1 min from ventral views of the animals . 
The images were recorded and photon emission was quantified using LivingImage software package . 
A light image was also recorded , which was then superimposed to the luminescence image to localize the luminescence activity . 
Cell lines
The HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells , CT26 mouse colon cancer cells , and Hepa 1-6 mouse hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium plus 10 % fetal bovium serum at 371C in a 5 % CO2 incubator . 
Plasmid constructs and stable selection
The 1.8 kb mAFP cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and the primers used were 50-GCCATGAAGTGGAT CAC ACC-30 ( forward ) and 50-AGATGTTTAAACGCCCA AAGC-30 ( reverse ) . 
RT-PCR template total RNA was isolated from Hepa 1-6 cells and the cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA6 ( Invitrogen ) and a modified pGL3 ( Pro-mega ) vectors ( Figure 2a ) . 
The mAFP gene has been confirmed by automatic sequencing . 
Stable cell line was generated by transfecting pcDNA6-mAFP into CT-26 cell lines and selected by blasticidine at 6 mg/ml . 
Protein expression of mAFP was determined by Western blotting with a polyclonal rabbit anti-murine AFP antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . 
Cytotoxic T-cell lysis assay
Cytotoxicity was measured and calculated by a standard PKH67 ( Sigma ) and PI double staining assay following the manufacturer 's instruction . 
Splenocytes were harvested 1 week after three times of oral feeding with transformed attenuated S. typhimurium and challenge 6 with 1 10 CT26-mAFP cells . 
Harvested splenocytes were then subsequently cultured for 3 days at 371C in RPMI-10 culture medium supplemented with 20 IU/ml IL-2 . 
CT26-mAFP cells were used as target cells at 16 various effector-to-target cell ratios . 
The percentage of target cells killed by cytotoxic T cell was determined using flow cytometry analysis . 
Immunization and tumor challenge
Five BALB/c mice were used for the CT26-mAFP lung colonization assay and four C57/J mice were used for the Hepa1-6 subcutaneous ( s.c. ) xenograft model . 
Both groups of mice were immunized for three times at 2 weeks intervals by gavaging with 100 ml of 5 % dextrose water ( D5W ) containing 1 10 transformed attenuated 8 S. typhimurium either with empty vector pGL3 or antigen containing vector pGLmAFP . 
At 1 week thereafter , 1 10 Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells were inoculated into 6 right flank of mice to induce the primary tumors , whereas 5 10 or 1 10 CT26-mAFP cells were intravenously 4 5 ( i.v. ) injected to induce pulmonary tumor colonization . 
Tumors were measured for width and length , and then the volume was determined according to ( W L ) / 2 . 
Pul-2 monary tumor colonization were examined and scored by a visual evaluation assessing the percentage of lung surface covered by colonized tumors as follows : 0 1/4 0 % , 1p20 % , 2 1/4 20 -- 50 % , 3X50 % .17 
Statistical analysis
Kaplan -- Meier analysis was used for the survival rate analysis . 
Changes in tumor volumes were tested for statistical significance with the Student 's two-tailed t-test . 
Student 's two-tailed t-test was also used to analyze the results from cytotoxic T-cell lysis assay . 
Results Generation of attenuated S. typhimurium expressing the bioluminescent gene To better detect in vivo location of the attenuated S. typhimurium , we first transformed these cells to express a bacterial luminescent gene ( luxCDABE ) . 
Briefly , the plasmid that contains lux gene operon was transformed into attenuated S. typhimurium . 
The resulting attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells express the bioluminescent and produce light stably at 371C , and thus do not require exogenous aldehyde substrate . 
Total photon emitted 18 from attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells was then collected and measured by Xenogen IVIS camera system and LivingImage software package ( Xenogen ) . 
As shown in Figure 1a , a positive correlation was observed between luminescent intensity represented by the relative light unit and the cell numbers . 
We then asked whether the growth of attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cell correlates with the luminescent intensity and whether these cells remain bioluminescent gene expression under no anti-biotic selection pressure . 
As shown in Figure 1b , both the cell number ( left panel ) and the luminescent intensity ( right panel ) of attenuated S. typhimurium-lux increased time dependently , further indicating a linear relationship between lux genes expression and cell growth . 
Notably , the attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells maintained the same level of luminescent intensity under both ampicillin selection and ampicillin-free conditions ( Figure 1b , right panel ) , suggesting that the lux gene operon plasmid stably exists in the attenuated S. typhimurium . 
In vivo safety of oral administration of the attenuated S. typhimurium
To ensure oral ingestion of attenuated S. typhimurium is safe , we determined the time needed for mice to clear the attenuated S. typhimurium-lux and whether these cells could reconvert into a pathogen , which is considered as a major safety issue . 
To this ends , we orally fed the mice with attenuated S. typhimurium-lux cells at a range of 1 10 to 1 10 cells per mouse and monitored the 5 9 luminescent intensity at different time points up to 24 h . 
The luminescence produced by attenuated S. typhimuriumlux dramatically decreased at 9 h after oral feeding at all dose ( Figure 1c ) . 
No luminescence was detected after 24 h postfeeding ( data not shown ) . 
The results suggest that the attenuated S. typhimurium-lux did not grow in an in vivo condition . 
Importantly , the tested mice showed normal moving activity and were in a good health condition 1 month after the oral feeding , suggesting that the attenuated S. typhimurium cells did not convert back to a pathogen . 
Together , these data suggest oral adminis-19 tration of the attenuated S. typhimurium is a safe procedure .

To test whether oral fed attenuated S. typhimurium DNA vaccine carrying mAFP antigen could protect mice from cancer development , we use the CT26 colon cancer cells that are syngeneic and tumorigenic to BALB/c mice to generate a CT26-mAFP cell line which constantly expresses mAFP ( Figure 2a ) . 
CT26 parental cells were transfected with pcDNA6-mAFP plasmid and selected with medium containing 6 mg/ml blasticidine . 
Single colony of CT26-mAFP was then picked up and the expression of mAFP was confirmed by Western blot analysis . 
As shown in Figure 2b , the expression of mAFP was detected in the CT26-mAFP stable line and a positive control cell line Hepa1-6 , but not in the parental CT26 . 
Both CT26-mAFP and Hepa1-6 cell lines were used for subsequent experiments in this study . 
Intravenous injec-4 tion of 5 10 CT26-mAFP cells through tail vein was sufficient to cause reproducible lung colonization in 100 % of animals within 4 weeks . 
The colonization activity of CT26-mAFP is similar to that of the parental CT26 cells ( data not shown ) .

Attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccine induced cytotoxic T-cell-mediated lysis 
To investigate the tumor-specific immunity in attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP DNA vaccine-treated mice toward killing the CT26-mAFP cells , we carried out cytotoxic T-cell lysis assay . 
The attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP-treated mice showed stronger MHC class I antigenrestricted CD8 þ T-cell killing response compared to those treated with the control attenuated S. typimurium-vector cells . 
The data shown in Figure 3a indicated that splenocytes of mice immunized with the vaccine encoding pGLmAFP were effective in killing CT26-mAFP colon cancer cells in vitro at different effector-to-target cell ratios . 
In contrast , CD8 þ T cells isolated from mice immunized with the attenuated S. typhimurium cells carrying empty vector pGL3 produced only the basal levels of tumor cell lysis . 
Taken together , attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP produced tumor-specific immunity via activation of CD8 þ T cells . 
Suppression of tumor growth by attenuated S. typimurium DNA vaccine

We next aimed to investigate the prevention effect of attenuated S. typimurium oral vaccine on HCC formation and colon cancer lung colonization assay . 
Using BALB/c mice , we established experimental metastasis model using CT26-mAFP colon cancer cells . 
In addition , C57J/L mice with s.c. grafted Hepa1-6 hepatoma xenografts were generated . 
Tumor cells were injected into mice 1 week after three times oral feeding of attenuated S. typimuriummAFP . 
Interestingly , attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP administration significantly reduced the number and score of the lung colonization of CT26-mAFP , compared with the attenuated S. typimurium-vector control group ( Figure 3b ) . 
The mean survival time of CT26-mAFP tumor challenged mice was also significantly prolonged by the attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP treatment ( Figure 3c ) . 
We further examined the effect of attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP oral DNA vaccine on Hepa1-6 HCC model . 
The results ( Figure 4a ) showed the attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP provided a significant protection effect on Hepa1-6 xenografts growth following 6 1 10 cells challenge . 
Following a challenge with more tumor cell ( 5 10 / injection ) , the Salmonella oral vaccine 6 still provided a good protection ( data not shown ) . 
In contrast , the attenuated S. typimurium-pGL3 control cells did not show any prevention effects . 
Importantly , the mean survival time was significantly prolonged by attenuated S. typimurium-mAFP treatment ( Figure 4b ) . 
Taken together , attenuated S. typimurium oral DNA vaccine carrying mAFP antigen plasmid prevented the CT26-mAFP and Hepa1-6 tumor development in mice .

Discussion
HCC are highly malignant tumors and patients with HCC have an average survival time of less than 1 year . 
Most HCC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with cirrhosis and the tumor are not eligible for surgery . 
For 2 these patients who could not undergo surgery and liver transplantation , immunotherapy represents an attractive 3 alternative . 
Activation of an HCC-specific immune response can be accomplished by targeting tumor-associated self-antigens . 
In contrast to the immunotherapy using coimmunization with an AFP DNA vaccine and an immune response stimulator , such as , heat-shock protein70 and CTLA4 , the attenuated S. typhimurium 20 21 oral DNA vaccines provide dual effects in one administration . 
The attenuated S. typhimurium not only serves as a DNA vaccine delivery vehicle but also an immune response stimulator . 
Notably , the anti-tumor outcome 13 of AFP DNA vaccine has failed to meet the expectation in Sakei 's animal experiments due to a possible adverse effect caused by the immunological response of the host . 
22 The attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccines could overcome such concerns by providing broad spectrum of immune response directly targeting to host lymph nodes and counteracting with all kinds of antigen-presentation cells including macrophage , DCs , and mast cells . 
In 12 addition , the attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccine provides a noninvasive administration with advantages of low cost , easy preparation and storage . 
Attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccines have been shown to provide protection against melanoma , 23 colon , breast , and non-small-cell lung carcinomas . 
17 14 24 The vaccines are directed against cancer-specific antigens such as carcinoembryonic antigen , tyrosine-related protein , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and transcription factor Fos-related antigen-1 . 
12,14,17,23,25 While attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccine has not been engineered to target HCC , our study here reports for the first time that attenuated S. typimurium carrying mAFP is of potential use for HCC prevention . 
Figure 2 Construction of mAFP expression plasmid and selection of tumor cell line that stably expresses mAFP . 
( a ) Schematic map of transgene vector . 
The DNA encoding the entire mAFP gene was inserted into the pcDNA6 or modified pGL3 vector . 
The pcDNA6-mAFP contained the blasticidin-resistant gene and was used to select the stable cell line rather than the parental CT26 tumor cells . 
The pGLmAFP was used to transform the attenuated S. typhimurium . 
( b ) Expression of mAFP in CT26 stable line and Hepa1-6 cell line . 
Protein expression of mAFP was determined by Western blot in which mAFP protein appeared as 70 kDa in molecular weight . 
Levels of b-actin were also determined and served as loading controls . 
The oral DNA vaccines developed in this study are capable of inducing potent cell-mediated protective immunity and breaking peripheral T-cell tolerance against the self-antigen AFP , resulting in effective suppression of HCC tumor growth and colon cancer CT26-mAFP lung colonization . 
Indeed , the immunity to self-antigen is difficult to elicit because of immune tolerance . 
However , such thymal central deletion of immature immune cell precursors might not complete . 
Dr Geissler showed that mAFP 26 messenger RNA was not detectable in the thymus of newborn mice . 
Moreover , they also excluded the possibi-lity that peptides that are derived from mAFP synthesized in the liver are presented to the immune system in a tolerogenic manner . 
Regarding the human subject , it has been shown by Dr Economou 's group that both murine 6,7 and human T-cell repertories could recognize AFP antigen despite being exposed to high plasma levels of this oncofetal protein during embryonic development because some AFP-specific T cells have not been deleted during the ontogeny of immune system . 
Based on Drs Geissler and Economou 's results , T cells with low / intermediate affinity of T-cell receptors for AFP have evaded central thymal deletion in mice and in human . 
Such ignorant T cells could be stimulated to against self-antigen . 
The different levels of immune protection between the vaccines against two cancer cell lines have been observed and are primarily caused by the animal model we used . 
The animal model we used for CT26-mAFP colon cancer cells is experimental metastasis , that is , lung colonization by i.v. injection of cancer cells . 
However , the animal model we used for Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells is a subcutaneous xenograft model . 
It is known that the experimental metastases are more malignant than the subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in terms of tumor growth rate and mouse mortality . 
Moreover , Grimm et al. suggested that the induction of mAFP-specific 26 CTL was more effective in C57/6 mice than in BALB/c mice due to higher TH1 bias in C57/6 mice . 
Furthermore , the different genetic background of these cell lines could also contribute to the different level of protection . 
One major concern using attenuated S. typhimurium oral DNA vaccines is , however , the safety issue . 
As the bioluminescent gene operon provides a powerful tool to monitor the bacterial growth in vivo and has 27 been successfully used to monitor bacterial infection path in vivo , we therefore monitored the attenuated 18 S. typhimurium uptake process in animals using the bioluminescent marker . 
Importantly , in vivo uptake studies showed no evidences of pathogenic conversion , although a long-term observation may be needed . 
Taken together , the findings from the current study and other reports indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium is safe 13 when used to deliver DNA vaccines . 
In summary , the attenuated Salmonella DNA vaccine that we generated to carry the AFP cancer antigen significantly induced antigen-specific CTL response and thereby prevented liver cancer development . 
The findings from this study , thus , provide a rationale for future development of AFP-specific oral DNA vaccines that may prevent high-risk individuals from developing HCC .
