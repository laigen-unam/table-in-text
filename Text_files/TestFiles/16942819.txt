Abstract 
vaccines . 
Various vaccine parameters can affect the immune responses elicited by Salmonella vectors , including the expression level , location and timing of expressed antigens . 
We have previously established immunogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains which cytoplasmically express hemagglutinin B ( HagB ) of Porphyromonas gingivalis , a putative periodontal pathogen . 
In this study , we sought to determine whether the 39 kDa HagB protein could be stably expressed on the surface of an avirulent Salmonella vaccine strain . 
The hagB gene was cloned into an expression plasmid as a C-terminal fusion with Lpp-OmpA , a hybrid surface display system . 
High expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB proved to be toxic to the vaccine strain , and it was necessary to introduce attenuating mutations in the trc promoter . 
Stable expression was obtained in transformants with promoter mutations that resulted in low levels of expression . 
The expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB was conﬁrmed by ELISA and Western blot . 
Localization to the outer membrane/periplasm was conﬁrmed by transmission electron microscopy using immunogold labeling , surface labeling of whole mounts using electron microscopy , ﬂow cytometry , and by quantitation of HagB in cytoplasmic , as well as inner and outer cell membrane fractions . 
When delivered orally in mice , the surface-expressing strain induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses to HagB than a cytoplasmic expressing strain , while responses in secretions were comparable . 
These results suggest that surface localization may differentially enhance the immunogenicity of antigens expressed by live , avirulent Salmonella vaccine vectors .

are capable of invading mucosal inductive sites in the gut and surviving within macrophages . 
Attenuated Salmonella can induce humoral , mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses to themselves as well as to expressed heterologous antigens [ 1,2 ] . 
Antigens being expressed in Salmonella can escape digestive degradation in the gastrointestinal tract Salmonellae are facultative intracellular parasites which and can be delivered to the Peyer 's patches , which comprise the largest inductive site of the mucosal immune system [ 3,4 ] . 
which cytoplasmically express HagB , a hemagglutinin and potential virulence factor from the putative periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis [ 5,6 ] . 
The recombinant vaccine strains induce generalized secretory and systemic immune responses to HagB [ 7 -- 10 ] . 
These constructs have been shown to induce long-term mucosal memory of up to a year in BALB/c mice [ 11 ] .

Some studies have suggested that surface display of antigen on th We have previously constructed live , avirulent Salmonella Most recombinant Salmonella vaccines that have been vaccine carrier may increase immunogenicity , although the mechanisms are still unclear [ 12 -- 16 ] . 
topes on the surface of bacteria , although many are limited in the size of the protein which can be effectively transported and expressed [ 17,18 ] . 
One approach that is capable of transporting and displaying large proteins on the surface of cells is the Lpp-OmpA hybrid display system . 
Surface translocation of a passenger protein is mediated by the N-terminal outer membrane localization signal from the Escherichia coli major lipoprotein ( Lpp ) fused to a domain from the outer membrane protein OmpA [ 19 ] . 
This system has been successfully used to export proteins as large as 54 kDa [ 17 ] . 
In this study we examined the utility of the Lpp-OmpA hybrid display system for the display of HagB , a 39 kDa hemagglutinin of P. gingivalis , on the surface of a live , attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain . 
Several systems have been described for expressing epi ¬

HagB fusion protein , mutations corresponding to those analyzed above were introduced in the − 10 region of the trc promoter of pSEN2 using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . 
To eliminate the possibility of point mutations in the vector , the mutated promoter region was removed by digestion with BglI and used to replace the wild-type promoter region in the original pSEN2 plasmid . 
Mutated plasmids were electroporated into S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 4072 .

pattern of pSEN2 strains in thin sections was clearly different from the cytoplasmic strains , we could not deﬁnitively determine whether HagB was located on the outer cell surface using only this technique . 
To further conﬁrm surface expression , whole cells reacted with anti-HagB IgG , followed by colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody were examined by EM . 
Abundant surface labeling was seen with the strain bearing pSEN2 ( Fig. 2 , right panel ) . 
Cytoplasmic-expressing strains were negative ( not shown ) .

Unﬁxed whole cells were reacted with anti-HagB IgG Surface expression was also conﬁrmed using ﬂow cytomfollowed by FITC-labeled chain-speciﬁc goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody . 
A clear shift in ﬂuorescence intensity was seen when pSEN2 reacted with anti-HagB antibody , but not with the cytoplasmic-expressing strain pJPHagB ( Fig. 3 ) . 
3.4. Insertion of attenuating mutations in the trc promoter
ing the lacIq plasmid pYA292 to suppress expression , or Salmonella 4072 were unsuccessful . 
We speculated that expression of the Lpp-OmpA-HagB fusion under the native trc promoter was toxic . 
To reduce expression level , promoter mutations were introduced into pSEN2 . 
Repeated attempts to transform E. coli 6097 not carry-primers synthesized with random nucleotide substitutions in the − 10 region , ﬁrst using plasmid pCRB2922 as a template . 
In this construct , which lacks Lpp-OmpA , HagB is expressed cytoplasmically directly under control of the trc promoter , and expression levels could be evaluated without interference from Lpp-OmpA . 
The plasmid library was transformed into E. coli 6097 and screened by colony immunoblotting for intensity of HagB expression . 
Several transformants of varying intensity were isolated , and plasmids were introduced into S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 4072 . 
Cell lysates were screened for HagB expression by ELISA . 
Three attenuating mutations were chosen which spanned a large range of expression levels ( Table 2 ) . 
The corresponding mutations were introduced into the − 10 region of the trc promoter in pSEN2 by site-directed mutagenesis . 
However , transformants were only obtained with the plasmid that carried mutation 148 , designated pSEN2-148 . 
That transformants were obtained only with the lowest-expressing mutant supported the notion that high level expression was toxic . 
148 in 4072 was 1.5 % of wild-type ( Table 2 ) . 
Because A library of mutations was generated by PCR using The level of HagB from the promoter mutant pSEN2-of the low expression level , HagB could not be reliably detected by EM or FACS . 
The Lpp-OmpA-HagB fusion protein could be detected by ELISA and Western blot . 
Lysates were examined by Western blotting on 10 % SDS-PAGE gels using rabbit anti-HagB . 
The 39 kDa HagB ( Fig. 4 , lane 2 ) migrates anomalously at 49 kDa on SDS-PAGE [ 7 ] . 
A major immunoreactive band at 55.8 kDa was seen in lysates from strains containing pSEN2-148 ( Fig. 4 , lane 3 ) , which is consistent with the predicted size of 55706 Da for the Lpp-OmpA-HagB fusion protein .

3.5. Localization by cell fractionation

Considering the localization pattern seen in cytoplasmic strains by TEM where the majority of labeling occurs in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 ) , the small amounts in the inner and outer membrane fractions probably represent largely background contamination of the ultracentrifuge fractions . 
In contrast , there was a pronounced shift to the inner and outer membrane fractions in 4072 / pSEN2-148 .

expressing Salmonella vaccine strain 4072/pSEN2 -148 , or with 4072/pCRB148 , which expresses HagB cytoplasmically . 
Both possess a trc promoter with the 148 mutation and express HagB at about 2 % of the wild-type ( Table 2 ) . 
Responses to HagB were seen in serum and secretions following immunization and boosting with both vaccine strains ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Both IgG and IgA responses in serum tended to be higher following immunization and boosting with Mice were immunized and boosted with the surface-the surface-expressing strain compared to the cytoplasmicexpressing strain . 
The IgG anti-HagB response at week 19 was signiﬁcantly higher for 4072/pSEN2 -148 compared to 4072/pCRB148 ( p < 0.05 ) . 
The serum IgA anti-HagB response was signiﬁcantly higher at week 17 for 4072 / pSEN2-148 compared to 4072/pCRB148 ( p < 0.05 ) . 
The differences in IgA responses in saliva and vaginal washes between the two strains were not statistically signiﬁcant . 
4. Discussion
surfaces has been extensively studied for a variety of applications . 
These include generation of peptide display libraries for epitope mapping , receptor -- ligand binding studies , industrial and bioremediation applications employing surface expression of speciﬁc enzymes , and in live recombinant vaccines [ 17,18,28,29 ] . 
It has been hypothesized that surface expression of antigen in live vaccines may have a variety of effects on the interaction of the expressed immunogen with the immune system [ 12 -- 16 ] . 
For example , surface expression may alter the processing by antigen presenting cells . 
Antigen displayed on the surface of Salmonella may also be more immunogenic due to the adjuvant effect of associated lipopolysaccharide and other microbial components with immunomodulatory activity . 
In recall responses surface localization may more readily allow direct interaction with memory cells .

Many approaches are capable of displaying small peptides in external loops of surface-located molecules , but display of large proteins has presented more problems [ 17,18,28,29 ] . 
fusion to display a potential virulence factor of P. gingivalis , HagB . 
The lipoprotein ( Lpp ) moiety targets the passenger protein to the outer membrane , while the OmpA fragment allows external display and anchoring of a C-terminal passenger protein . 
The system is capable of displaying proteins up to 54 kDa [ 19 ] . 
A disadvantage of this system is that high levels of expression can be toxic to the host strain [ 30,31 ] . 
Toxicity may arise from both the surface expression moiety and the passenger protein . 
As with most systems designed to display large molecules , misfolding of the passenger protein in the periplasm can interfere with surface expression as has been shown with alkaline phosphatase [ 30 ] . 
If this is the case with pSEN2 , it may be possible to express smaller regions of HagB which do not contain structural features which lead to misfolding . 
Certain features of passenger proteins may interfere with transport . 
For example , cysteine residues can cause problems with surface transport in the Neisseria IgAl protease autotransporter system [ 32 ] . 
Mutation of certain residues or elimination of problem structural features may allow higher surface expression levels Directed surface expression of proteins on bacterial cell A variety of approaches for effecting surface display have In this study we have examined the use of the Lpp-OmpA sion under a strong promoter such as trc could not be achieved and required attenuating mutations . 
Stable expression was obtained only when the plasmid carried a promoter mutation leading to low expression levels ( 1.5 % of wild-type ) . 
Higher expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB may be possible , however , in our studies 33 % expression and higher was lethal to the vaccine strain . 
important to employ multiple techniques that rely on different approaches for detection . 
Cell fractionation studies of surface-expressing strains indicated a predominance of HagB in the outer membrane fractions compared to the cytoplasmic strains . 
Immunogold labeling of thin sections indicated a clear shift in localization between the cytoplasmic and surface-expressing strains . 
In the latter , HagB can be visualized both in the periplasmic space as well as on the inner and outer membranes . 
Whether the HagB in the periplasm represents fusion protein in transit , an excess accumulation , or fusion protein that is blocked from further transport by misfolding of the passenger domain is not known . 
Because there remains some uncertainty with regard to surface exposure when examining thin sections , immunogold labeling of whole cells and ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting is helpful in conﬁrming surface localization . 
responses in serum both after primary and boost immu-With the Lpp-OmpA-HagB fusion , constitutive expresPrecise localization of antigen can be difﬁcult , and it is Orally immunized mice exhibited higher IgG and IgA nizations with the surface-expressing strain 4072/pSEN2 -148 . 
In saliva and vaginal washes however , similar IgA responses were seen . 
The reasons for the differences in responses between the systemic and mucosal compartments are not known . 
Part of the reason for the differential response could be due to the low levels of recombinant antigen expression . 
The threshold for enhancement in the mucosal compartment may be higher . 
There could also be differences in antigen processing between mucosal and systemic inductive sites that depend on the localization of antigen in the vaccine strains . 
We have previously shown that the predominant IgG subclass response to HagB induced by recombinant Salmonella vaccine strains are IgG2a and IgG2b , both of which are complement ﬁxing [ 9 ] . 
After boosting , the presence of antibody in serum , particularly complement ﬁxing subclasses of IgG , could enhance the immunogenicity of surface-expressing strains in the spleen and lymph nodes . 
IgG and complement coating a surfaceexpressing Salmonella could interact with Fc and complement receptors which may have an immunomodulatory effect [ 33,34 ] . 
In Peyer 's patches , the surface-expressing strains may be coated with secretory IgA which may not have as great an inﬂuence on the subsequent mucosal immune response . 
More studies are needed to elucidate potential differences in expression levels , trafﬁcking and antigen presentation between cytoplasmic and surface-expressing strains genicity of foreign antigens displayed on live , avirulent Salmonella vaccine vectors . 
This could be important with antigens whose expression is toxic to the vaccine strain , and might be useful in achieving the balance between adequate expression levels and vector ﬁtness , which is necessary for optimal immunogenicity of live , avirulent vaccines . 
In summary , surface expression may enhance the immuno ¬
