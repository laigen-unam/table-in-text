Abstract 
( pBD-1 ) , has been described in pig , which was found to be expressed at low levels in the intestine . 
We set-up a quantitative PCR method to detect the gene expression of pBD-1 and a newly discovered porcine - defensin , pBD-2 . 
Expression of pBD-1 mRNA increased from the proximal to the distal part of the intestine whereas pBD-2 expression decreased . 
The main gene expression sites for pBD-2 were kidney and liver , whereas pBD-1 was mainly expressed in tongue . 
The porcine small intestinal segment perfusion ( SISP ) technique was used to investigate effects of Salmonella typhimurium DT104 on intestinal morphology and pBD-1 and pBD-2 mRNA levels in vivo . 
The early responses were studied 2 , 4 and 8 h post-infection in four separate jejunal and ileal segments . 
Immunohistochemistry showed invasion of the mucosa by Salmonella and changes in intestinal morphology . 
However , no concomitant changes in expression of either pBD-1 or pBD-2 were observed . 
We conclude that at least two defensins are differentially expressed in the intestine of pigs , and that expression of both defensins is not altered by S. typhimurium under these conditions .

1. Introduction
antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) . 
Hundreds of AMPs have been described in vertebrates , invertebrates , plants ( http://www .

htm ) and recently even in a fungus ( Mygind et al. , 2005 ) , the number of newly discovered AMPs is still growing fast . 
Although originally thought of as true antimicrobial peptides , capable of killing bacteria by membrane disruption , several additional roles in innate immunity Defensins comprise a major subclass of the family of neering , Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , Heverlee , Belgium .

These include chemotactic activities for immature dendritic cells , memory T-cells and monocytes ( Territo et al. , 1989 ; Yang et al. , 2000 ) , stimulation of angiogenesis ( Conejo-Garcia et al. , 2004 ; Li et al. , 2000 ) and mast cell activation to induce chemotaxis , histamine release and prostaglandin ( PGD2 ) production ( Niyonsaba et al. , 2001 , 2002 ) . 
Thus , besides being effector molecules of innate immunity , - defensins also provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity . 
where intestinal microbes symbiotically interact with host cells ( Xu and Gordon , 2003 ) . 
Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in microbe -- host crosstalk , thereby maintaining intestinal microbiotic homeostasis . 
Increasing evidence suggests that decreased levels or malfunctioning of defensins in the intestine might lead to disturbance of this homeostasis resulting i The intestine is best seen as a complex and dynamic system intestinal diseases such as Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis in human ( Wehkamp et al. , 2005a , b ) . 
Furthermore , an upregulation of intestinal defensins is observed as an early response to bacterial infections of the intestine ( Zilbauer et al. , 2005 ) . 
been described up to date ( Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
This defensin was found primarily in tongue mucosa but low mRNA levels were also found in other epithelial tissues including the intestine . 
Based on sequence homology of the cysteine residues , three other - defensin mRNA sequences have been discovered in porcine Expressed Sequence Tags databases and have been assigned pBD-2 -- 4 ( GenBankTM : AY506573 , AY4605575 and AY4605576 ) . 
Of these - defensins , no data on structure , expression pattern or biological activity has been described to date . 
trary to other inducible - defensins , such as human - defensins 2 and 3 ( Harder et al. , 2001 ; Liu et al. , 1998 ) , tracheal antimicrobial peptide ( TAP ) ( Diamond et al. , 1996 ) or bovine epithelial beta defensin ( EBD ) ( Tarver et al. , 1998 ) . 
This is mainly based on in vitro experiments where no induction of pBD-1 could be observed in tongue epithelial cells upon infection with Salmonella typhimurium ( Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
However , in other tissues , where lower levels of pBD-1 are observed , pBD-1 levels may be regulated by pathogenic bacteria . 
Especially in the intestine , a constitutive high expression of defensin ( or other AMP ) molecules could be undesirable because of the impact on the beneﬁcial commensal bacteria in the intestinal microﬂora ( Finlay and Hancock , 2004 ) . 
typhimurium ) is an important intestinal pathogen that causes several diseases in animals and humans . 
In pigs , it is mainly associated to enterocolitis , a disease very similar to gastroenteritis in humans ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
S. typhimurium phagetype DT104 , that is isolated with increasing frequency in clinical isolates , causes an additional public health threat because of its antibiotic resistance ( Akkina et al. , 1999 ) . 
The effect of S. typhimurium on the regulation of antimicrobial peptides is slowly emerging . 
Recently , an eight-fold increase in pBD-1 mRNA expression was observed upon S. typhimurium infection in the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC J2 ( Sang et al. , 2005 ) , also showing for the ﬁrst time that upregulation of pBD-1 is indeed possible . 
In addition , S. typhimurium ( or structural proteins of S. typhimurium ) have been shown to upregulate expression of human - defensins in vitro ( Ogushi et al. , 2001 ) and in vivo ( O'Neil et al. , 1999 ) . 
These ﬁndings , and the fact that pBD-1 has been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against S. typhimurium in vitro ( Shi et al. , 1999 ) , indicate a potential role for defensin upregulation in the intestine upon S. typhimurium infection as part of the total innate immune response .

In addition , the effect of S. typhimurium DT104 infection on intestinal morphology and the early transcriptional pBD-1 and pBD-2 response ( 0 -- 8 h ) of pig intestinal mucosa is investigated using the small intestinal segment perfusion ( SISP ) technique .

et al. ( 1993 ) . 
Brieﬂy , four pigs were sedated with 0.1 ml azaperone ( Stressnil ) / kg bodyweight ; after 15 min , inhalation anaesthesia was performed with a gas mixture of 39 % oxygen , 58 % nitrous oxide and an initial 3 % isoﬂurane ; after 10 min , 2 The SISP was performed essentially as described by Nabuurs isoﬂurane . 
The abdominal cavity was opened and seven segments of 20 cm ( control segments ) or 40 cm ( infected segments ) were prepared by inserting a small inlet tube in the cranial site and a wide outlet tube into the caudal site of a segment . 
The ﬁrst two segments were located in the proximal jejunum directly after the ligament of Treitz . 
Segments three and four were located in the mid-jejunum and segments ﬁve , six and seven covered most of the ileum . 
The location of the segments is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . 
Segments 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 ( initially 40 cm ) were perfused for 1 h with peptone solution containing 109 CFU/ml of S. typhimurium , followed by perfusion with peptone only . 
Control segments ( # 2 , 4 and 6 ) ( initially 20 cm ) were perfused with peptone only . 
Mucosal samples for histology and RNA isolation ( 10 cm ) were taken at 0 , 2 , 4 and 8 h as indicated in Fig. 1 , after which the tubing was reconnected , and perfusion was resumed . 
After sample collection at 8 h , the pigs were euthanised by barbiturate overdose .

Brieﬂy , endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol . 
Normal goat serum ( 10 % , v/v , Jackson Immunoresearch West Grove , PA , USA ) + 2.5 % BSA , was used to reduce non-speciﬁc background staining . 
After incubation with the secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Vector , Burlingame , CA , USA , 1:250 in PBS + 2.5 % BSA ) sections were treated with ABC/PO reagent ( Vector ) for 30 min . 
Between steps , sections were rinsed in PBS/Tween . 
Finally , the sections were incubated with DAB ( 3,3 ′ - diamino-benzidine , Sigma ) , Invasion of S. typhimurium was established by immuno ¬

Probes were labelled with 5 ′ FAM ( pBD-1 and HPRT ) or 5 ′ Yakima Yellow ( pBD-2 ) and 3 ′ Deep Dark Quencher 1 ( all probes ) . 
All qPCR reactions were performed using one-step qPCR technology ( Eurogentec ) , utilizing 0.1 ng RNA per reaction in 25 l on a ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems , Weiterstadt , Germany ) , using the following cycling protocol : 30 min at 48 ◦ C ( RT step ) and 10 min at 95 ◦ C ( denaturation ) ; 42 cycles : 15 s at 95 ◦ C and 60 s at 60 ◦ C. Relative gene expression to the housekeeping gene HPRT was performed in order to correct for the variance in amounts of RNA input in the reactions . 
Additionally , the relative expression index ( REI : 2T SISP samples by comparison of the expression levels of the infected to the average expression levels of the control samples , with the index deﬁned as 1 .

Dilution experiments of RNA aliquots ( 160 pg -- 10 ng ) resulted in very similar ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies of the genes with gradients ranging from − 3.1 to − 3.4 ( R2 > 0.95 ) . 
Thus , results were normalized against HPRT by calculating the difference in Ct ( Ct ) and expressed as relative expression levels .

3.2. Gene expression of pBD-1 and pBD-2 in the intestine
pBD-1 and pBD-2 , mucosal scrapings along the whole intestine were taken from ﬁve healthy pigs . 
Expression of defensins along the intestine was assessed using qPCR and is shown in Fig. 2 . 
For pBD-1 , expression is low ( close to the detection limit in our system ) , in the duodenum , and then approximately 10-fold higher and relatively stable along the whole jejunum and ileum ( although a small increase from the proximal to distal part can be observed ) . 
pBD-2 expression is relatively high in the duodenum , drops at the start of the ileum and then slowly increases further In order to determine the intestinal gene expression pattern of distal along the jejunum which then shows another sudden drop at the beginning of the ileum . 
Although the differences are not statistically signiﬁcant ( p > 0.05 ) along the jejunum and ileum , this peculiar wave-shaped expression level in the intestine was observed in every single animal . 
defensin mRNA levels were also determined in several other tissues and are shown in Fig. 3 . 
The highest mRNA expression of pBD-1 ( relative to the household gene HPRT ) is observed in the tongue while all other tissues tested showed much lower expression levels . 
Mucosal scrapings of the tongue even had a 10-fold higher level of pBD-1 mRNA compared to tongue tissues ( not shown ) . 
For pBD-2 the expression pattern is quite different with kidney , liver and to a lower extend aorta and tongue having the highest mRNA expression . 
For both defensins it is obvious that , in healthy pigs , starting levels of defensin mRNA in the intestine are relatively low compared to other organs . 
To relate the intestinal expression of pBDs in the intestine ,

In general , granulocytes are observed after 2 h in all segments , and after 8 h a difference between the number of granulocytes in the lumen of infected and non-infected segments is seen . 
Granulocytes at other locations in the intestine do not seem to diffe The morphological characterization of the intestinal samples between infected and non-infected segments . 
Swelling of submucosa starts after 4 h and no difference is observed between infected and non-infected segments after 8 h. Swelling of villi was less distinct but could be observed in a few samples . 
However , overall morphology of the villi was well preserved after 8 h , indicating that the experimental procedure had a relatively mild effect within the time frame of the experiment on the intestinal morphology .

At all time points S. typhimurium could be detected in the infected segments , after 2 h mainly in the lumen and epithelium of the villi ( Fig. 4 ) , and at later time points also in the lamina propria . 
Occasionally , S. typhimurium was detected in the lymphatic vessels , serosa and mesentery . 
In a few samples , S. typhimurium could also be detected in the serosa and mesentery and lymphatic vessels of the control samples after 8 h . 
This is consistent with trafﬁc of S. typhimurium through the blood or lymphatic system .

Only small differences are observed between Total RNA was extracted from mucosal scrapings of all control and infected segments with three infected segments having a statistically signiﬁcantly different expression compared to the control segments ( p < 0.05 ) : a reduction of pBD-1 mRNA ( REI < 1 ) in the proximal part of the ileum ( segment 5 ) , and an increase of pBD-2 in the ﬁrst part of the jejunum ( segment 1 ) and the distal part of the ileum ( segment 7 ) . 
However , the S. typhimurium infected segments taken after 0 , 2 or 4 h showed similar defensin mRNA levels compared to the controls ( results not shown ) .

4. Discussion
infection on the expression of defensins in the intestinal epithelium , using the small intestinal perfusion technique . 
The SISP model was originally developed to study the effect of metabolites on water absorption capacity of the intestine ( Nabuurs et al. , 1993 ) , but has also proven to be a valuable technique for genomic studies ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
In this model , isolated segments of the jejunum and ileum can be infected with a high dose of pathogens while blood supply and innervation remain intact . 
One of the main advantages of this technique is the minimization of the effect of individual variation between animals because the control segments are within the same animal and in the same part of the intestine as the infected segments . 
Contrary to oral infections , the technique also provides the possibility to infect the intestinal epithelial cells with a known density of pathogens in vivo . 
This makes the SISP an important model for gastrointestinal research . 
In addition , a recently published genome analysis has shown that pig is much closer related to human than rodents ( Wernersson et al. , 2005 ) . 
The similarity of especially the alimentary tract also makes the SISP model an important tool for research in human gastrointestinal diseases . 
In this report , we describe the gene expression pattern of the - defensins pBD-1 and pBD-2 , and the effect of S. typhimurium extensive handling of intestinal segments during the experiment ( where besides the initial operation the segments have to be deand reattached to the tubes ) . 
Therefore , we performed for the ﬁrst time , an extensive morphological examination of infected and non-infected segments . 
This showed that , despite some swelling of the submucosa , the overall morphology of the non-infected control segments stayed well preserved ( Table 2 ) , during the whole experiment . 
In addition , quantitative PCR showed that the relative and absolute mRNA levels of defensins did not change ( not shown ) , indicating that the experimental procedure itself had no major impact on expression of the target genes . 
Furthermore , the epithelial marker I-FAB showed consistent expression in microarray analysis of the mid-jejunum segment ( Niewold et al. , personal communication ) and former studies have shown that the intestinal segments are functionally active with respect to water absorption ( Nabuurs et al. , 1993 ) , indicating again that no major effect is induced by the experimental procedure . 
On the later time points in the infection , more granulocytes were observed in both infected and non-infected segments and more swelling of villi and submucosa was visible . 
However , whether this was an effect due to the experimental procedure or whether it was a systemic reaction to the S. typhimurium infection can not be deduced from the current experimental set-up . 
one-step qPCR , a strategy that minimizes experimental variation because both steps ( reverse transcription and PCR ) are performed in one tube . 
However , using this technique , it is impossible to detect absolute mRNA levels of the target gene because this would involve comparison to cDNA standards that do not take into account the reverse transcriptase reaction efﬁciency ( Giulietti et al. , 2001 ; Wong and Medrano , 2005 ) . 
Therefore , relative gene expression compared to the housekeeping gene HPRT was used in this study . 
Depicting relative expression levels relies on similar PCR ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies of the two genes and stable expression of the housekeeping gene among different tissues . 
Whereas we showed that the ampliﬁcation efﬁciency was comparable in our experiments on the intestinal samples , the relative expression of HPRT in different organs was not addressed in our study . 
However , Oleksiewicz et al. ( 2001 ) have shown that in pigs , the expression level of housekeeping genes can vary up to 60-fold among different organs . 
Therefore , the gene expression levels in Fig. 2 are depicted as relative defensin expression ( since all samples are from the intestine ) while Fig. 3 depicts the expression levels as relative pBD/HPRT ratios . 
This indicates that the values depicted in Fig. 3 reﬂect differences in both housekeeping and target gene and should not be read as absolute expression levels of defensin mRNA . 
For detection of small differences in expression of the target gene in different organs , multiple housekeeping genes should be measured ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ) , which was outside of the scope of our study . 
Despite the possible variation in expression levels of the household gene , a general expression pattern in high and low expression sites can be found ( Fig. 3 ) . 
If the differences were merely reﬂecting HPRT mRNA level differences between tissues , a similar pattern would be observed for both pBD-1 and pBD-2 . 
Obviously , this is not the case . 
Th One of our concerns of the SISP model was the effect of Quantiﬁcation of defensin mRNA levels was performed by expression of pBD-1 correlates well with the pattern described before ( Zhang et al. , 1998 ) . 
For pBD-2 no expression sites have been described , but based on these studies , high levels of pBD-2 mRNA are found in liver , kidney and to a lesser extend aorta . 
One should always keep in mind though that age and health status of the animal can have a major impact on this expression pattern ( Caverly et al. , 2003 ; Meyerholz et al. , 2004 ; Stolzenberg et al. , 1997 ) . 
1 and pBD-2 in the intestine compared to other tissues could reﬂect a potential for upregulation of these defensins upon bacterial infection . 
Regulation of - defensin levels are , so far , only described at the transcriptional level where many triggers can induce gene expression and subsequent defensin protein levels . 
However , no large upregulation for either pBD-1 or pBD-2 was observed in our experimental conditions . 
Even though we found three intestinal segments having statistically signiﬁcant different gene expression after 8 h ( of which one segment showed a downregulation of pBD-1 ) , the in vivo signiﬁcance of these differences is very doubtful because of the low magnitude of the observed differences and the low starting levels of pBD expression in the intestine . 
We therefore concluded that there was no true upregulation of pBD-1 or pBD-2 under these experimental conditions . 
For pBD-1 , similar results were described using S. typhimurium or well known pro-inﬂammatory mediators such as LPS , TNF - and IL-1 in tongue epithelial cell cultures ( Liu et al. , 2001 ; Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
In addition , analysis of the promoter region of pBD-1 showed no consensus sequences for NF-IL6 or NF - B , which are present in the inducible EBD and TAP genes ( Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
The observed lack of induced expression of pBD-1 and pBD-2 could indicate that both defensins are constitutively expressed in the intestine , but it could also mean that other stimulatory factors trigger upregulation . 
In addition , it is possible that S. typhimurium can escape destruction by antimicrobial defence mechanisms by evading the immune response . 
This might , in fact , be one of the most important mechanisms of S. typhimurium to persist in the pig intestine . 
In this respect , it is interesting to see that this spe-ciﬁc Salmonella strain only caused a very mild response on gene expression , as deduced by microarray analysis , upon infection of the porcine jejunum ( Niewold et al. , personal communication ) , while enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli , under the same experimental conditions , caused the upregulation of approximately 300 genes ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
It would be very interesting to test whether other pathogens that cause more symptoms of inﬂammation , such as the enterotoxigenic E. coli would have an effect on pBD expression in the pig intestine . 
determined and showed a characteristic intestinal expression pattern for both defensins . 
The highest expression levels were found in tongue ( pBD-1 ) and kidney and liver ( pBD-2 ) . 
Small segment intestinal perfusion of piglets was used to test whether S. typhimurium DT104 could upregulate porcine - defensins 1 and 2 in vivo . 
No effect on pBD levels could be observed , indicating that intestinal pBD expression is either constitutive , or that S. typhimurium is capable of evading the host innate immune response . 
We hypothesized that the relatively low expression of pBD-In summary , gene expression for pBD-1 and pBD-2 was
