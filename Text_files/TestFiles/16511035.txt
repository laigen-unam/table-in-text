Uridine phosphorylase ( UPh ) catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of the C -- N glycosidic bond of uridine to ribose 1-phosphate and uracil in the pyrimidine-salvage pathway . 
The crystal structure of the Salmonella typhi-murium uridine phosphorylase ( StUPh ) has been determined at 2.5 Å resolution and reﬁned to an R factor of 22.1 % and an Rfree of 27.9 % . 
The hexameric StUPh displays 32 point-group symmetry and utilizes both twofold and threefold non-crystallographic axes . 
A phosphate is bound at the active site and forms hydrogen bonds to Arg91 , Arg30 , Thr94 and Gly26 of one monomer and Arg48 of an adjacent monomer . 
The hexameric StUPh model reveals a close structural relationship to Escherichia coli uridine phosphorylase ( EcUPh ) .

1. Introduction
The ability of cells to maintain a constant supply of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides is dependent on both de novo synthetic and salvage pathways . 
The relative importance of either the de novo or the salvage pathway in the maintenance of nucleotide pools is variable and dependent on the cell or tissue type . 
Uridine phosphorylase ( UPh ; EC 2.4.2.3 ) is an important enzyme in the pyrimidine-salvage pathway and catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil ,

This enzyme is found in most organisms , including human cells . 
Its level is frequently elevated in tumors . 
The amino-acid sequence of UPh is highly conserved among several bacterial UPhs as well as in vertebrate UPhs ( Pugmire & Ealick , 2002 ) . 
UPh has also been shown to be important in the activation and catabolism of ﬂuoropyrimidines and modulation of its enzymatic activity may affect the therapeutic efﬁcacy of these chemotherapeutic agents . 
UPh plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of both intracellular and plasma uridine concentrations . 
Uridine plasma concentration is under very stringent regulation , mostly as a function of liver metabolic control , intracellular UPh enzymatic activity and cellular transport by both facilitated diffusion and Na - dependent + active-transport mechanisms . 
Uridine is critical in the synthesis of RNA , the assembly of biological membranes through the formation of pyrimidine -- lipid and pyrimidine -- sugar conjugates , and the regulation of a number of biological processes .

UPh from Salmonella typhimurium ( StUPh ) contains 253 amino-acid residues . 
Comparison of the amino-acid sequences of StUPh and Escherichia coli UPh ( EcUPh ) shows them to be highly similar , with 97 % identity ( Zolotukhina et al. , 2003 ) . 
The differing amino-acid residues are generally not involved in the active site of UPh ; however , StUPh has a higher substrate speciﬁcity compared with its ortholog from E. coli ( Molchan et al. , 1998 ) . 
Although many purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) structures have been reported ( Bzowska et al. , 
1995 ; Ealick et al. , 1990 ; Mao et al. , 1997 ; Shi et al. , 2001 , 2004 ; Tebbe et al. , 1999 ) , only the EcUPh structure has been published . 
In this paper , we report the ﬁrst three-dimensional X-ray structure of StUPh and only the second example of a member of the UPh family .

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Purification, crystallization and X-ray data collection
StUPh was overexpressed in E. coli and puriﬁed by hydrophobic chromatography as described previously ( Dontsova et al. , 2004 ; Mikhailov et al. , 1992 ; Molchan et al. , 1998 ) . 
Fractions containing pure StUPh were pooled and dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM Tris -- HCl pH 7.3 , 0.4 % NaN3 and concentrated to 20 mg ml . 
Crystal-1 lization experiments were performed using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method on siliconized glass cover slides in Linbro plates at 294 K ( Dontsova et al. , 2004 ) . 
The reservoir solution contained 
100 mM sodium acetate trihydrate pH 5.0 , 7 % ( w/v ) PEG 8000 . 
The hanging drops contained 2.5 ml 20 mg ml 1 StUPh and 2.5 ml reservoir solution . 
Crystals appeared after 2 -- 3 d and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.10 0.05 0.04 mm within one week . 
The crystals were transferred into 20 % PEG 400 , 100 mM sodium acetate trihydrate buffer pH 5.0 prior to ﬂash-freezing in liquid nitrogen . 
The crystals belong to space group P61 , with unit-cell parameters a = 91.37 , c = 266.38 Å , and diffract to 2.5 Å resolution . 
The Matthews coefﬁcient ( Matthews , 1968 ) calculated for one hexamer per asymmetric unit was 2.01 Å Da , which corresponds to a solvent content 3 1 of 38 % . 
X-ray intensity data were collected at 100 K at beamline X13 ( EMBL/DESY , Hamburg , Germany ) . 
All data were processed and merged with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs ( Otwinowski & Minor , 1997 ) . 
Data-collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1 . 
2.2. Structure determination
The crystal structure was solved by the molecular-replacement method using a medium-resolution structure of StUPh ( PDB code 1ryz ) as the search model . 
The amino-acid sequences were obtained from the SWISS-PROT data bank ( CAA74658 ) . 
The program MOLREP ( Vaguine et al. , 1999 ) from the CCP4 suite gave a clear solution for one hexameric molecule of StUPh ( Table 1 ) . 
Following rigid-body reﬁnement with CNS v. 1.1 ( Brünger et al. , 1998 ) , the Rcryst for this model using all data to 2.5 Å converged to 42.8 % . 
2.3. Refinement
Noncrystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) restraints were used during the early stages of reﬁnement , but were relaxed in the later stages . 
The structure was subjected to several rounds of simulated-annealing reﬁnement using CNS ( Brünger et al. , 1998 ) and manual model inspection and rebuilding using O ( Jones et al. , 1991 ) . 
A free R factor ( Rfree ) , calculated from 5 % of reﬂections set aside at the outset , was used to monitor the progress of reﬁnement . 
The model bias present in the initial molecular-replacement solution was tackled using composite omit , cross-validated and A-weighted maps as implemented in CNS . 
When the Rcryst value reached 30 % , water molecules were placed into peaks greater than 3 from ( | Fo | | Fc | ) maps , but only when they were within a suitable hydrogen-bonding distance of protein atoms . 
After reﬁnement , water molecules whose positions were not supported by the electron density at 1 contouring in a A-weighted ( | 2Fo | | Fc | ) map were deleted . 
The ﬁnal model , reﬁned to an Rcryst of 22.1 % ( Rfree = 27.9 % ) at 2.5 Å resolution , showed good quality ( Table 2 ) as judged with the program PROCHECK 
( Laskowski et al. , 1993 ) and had no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot ( Ramachandran & Sasisekharan , 1968 ) . 
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Overall structure of StUPh
StUPh forms a symmetric doughnut-shaped homohexamer with a thickness of 51 Å and an outer diameter of 108 Å ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The overall structure is similar to the hexameric ( high-molecular-weight ) purine nucleoside phosphorylase family ( Morgunova et al. , 1995 ) . 
The hexamer has a central channel of about 19 Å diameter and a length of 30 Å . 
The channel narrows at one end to about 10 Å diameter and at the other end to about 16 Å diameter in the perpendicular direction . 
The hexamer can be thought of as a trimer of dimers with 32 pointgroup symmetry . 
Each monomer in the hexamer makes a close contact with an identical one related by a twofold noncrystallographic axis , forming the pairs AF , BD and EC . 
These three dimers , which contain two complete active sites per dimer , pack together to form a hexamer using the threefold non-crystallographic axis that is perpendicular to the three twofold axes ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The interface region between the two monomers related by the threefold NCS comprises only hydrophobic residues , with a contact surface area of 2066 Å . 
2 The interface region generated by the twofold NCS comprises both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds for each dimer . 
In the AF dimer these hydrogen-bonding amino acids are Arg48A -- Asp27F , Arg48A -- Glu49F , Arg87A -- Tyr172F , His122A -- Thr161F and Ser173A -- Gln209F . 
The contact area generated by the dimer interaction is 3303 Å . 
The monomers of the dimer pack together with an angle that 2 is 3 -- 4 less than the corresponding angle in EcUPh ( Caradoc-Davies et al. , 2004 ) . 
The hexamers in the P61 crystal form are packed in layers involving both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds . 
Seven hydrogen bonds form in one layer and 16 hydrogen bonds form in the other

The StUPh monomer belongs to the large class of / proteins . 
The fold of the StUPh monomer has a three-layer ( ) sandwich architecture reminiscent of a modiﬁed Rossmann fold . 
The monomer of StUPh has a central 11-stranded mixed - sheet core consisting of strands 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 11 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 , ﬂanked by six - helices ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The overall structure of StUPh is very similar to the structures of EcUPh and EcPNP ( Mao et al. , 1997 ) and retains the topology of the hexameric NP-I enzymes as described by Pugmire &

Ealick ( 2002 ) . 
Thus , the bacterial UPhs and high-molecular-weight bacterial PNPs show signiﬁcant structural homology , having a hexameric quaternary structure , a similar overall fold and similar sizes and positions of the secondary-structural elements . 
The main structural difference between hexameric UPhs and PNPs lies in the region of residues 160 -- 178 in EcUPh and StUPh ( Caradoc-Davies et al. , 2004 ) . 
In PNP , this region comprises a short stretch of three amino-acid residues ( 163 -- 165 ) that leads from the loop linking 7 to 
5 . 
In UPhs , this segment includes an additional 14 amino-acid residues to form an extended loop which folds over the surface of the adjacent monomer . 
3.3. Active site
The active site for EcUPh includes amino acids from two subunits ( Caradoc-Davies et al. , 2004 ; Morgunova et al. , 1995 ) . 
This region of StUPh ( using the BD dimer as representative ) contains a phosphate ion , which contacts amino acids Arg91B , Arg30B , Thr94B , Gly26B , Glu198B and Arg48D ( monomers B and D are related by twofold NCS ; Fig. 2 ) . 
The positions of residues are similar to the corresponding amino acids in EcUPh ( Caradoc-Davies et al. , 2004 ) . 
Therefore , it is likely that the ribose-binding and pyrimidine basebinding sites also resemble the corresponding sites in EcUPh . 
Consequently , for the BD dimer the ribose-binding site includes Glu198B , Arg91B , Met197B and His8D and the pyrimidine basebinding site includes Gln166B , Arg168B , Arg223B ( hydrogen bonds ) and Ile220B and Val22B ( hydrophobic interactions ) . 
Open , intermediate and closed active-site conformations have been described for EcUPh based on the position of residues in the loop 219 -- 239 . 
The open active site was observed when no substrates were bound and the intermediate and closed active-site conformations were found when substrates were bound to the monomers . 
Superposition of monomers from EcUPh and StUPh shows that 
StUPh contains only the open conformation of the active site . 
Therefore , the presence of a phosphate ion does not appear to inﬂuence the conformational state of the active-site loop . 
In future experiments we plan to obtain the X-ray structure for native StUPh at higher resolution and to determine the structures of
