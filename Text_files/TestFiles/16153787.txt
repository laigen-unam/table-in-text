Abstract 
Reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans is an increasing public health issue . 
This study aimed at characterizing Salmonella isolates from captive lizards and to compare them to human isolates . 
Salmonella was isolated from 25 of 33 cloacal and 47 of 79 faecal samples from captive lizards ( 75.8 and 59.5 % , respectively ) . 
The strains belonged to 44 serotypes of subspecies I ( 27 serotypes ) , II ( 9 ) , IIIb ( 3 ) and IV ( 5 ) . 
Two strains , one of serotype Enteritidis and one of serotype Amsterdam , were resistant to nitrofurantoin . 
Invasion assays in Caco-2 cells were performed with 40 saurian isolates of subspecies I , 15 isolates of subspecies II , 4 strains of subspecies IIIb , 6 subspecies IV isolates and 17 human isolates of corresponding serotypes of subspecies I. Saurian isolates belonging to subspecies I invaded the Caco-2 cells to a higher extent than those from the other subspecies . 
The human isolates invaded the Caco-2 cells to a lesser degree compared to their saurian counterparts . 
In the same strains , the presence of virulence genes agfA , shdA , spvR , pefA and sopE was determined using PCR . 
Whereas agfA was detected in all strains , pefA was only detected in one saurian and in the human serotype Enteritidis strains . 
The spvR gene was detected in the same serotype Enteritidis strains and in 33 % of the subspecies IV strains . 
The shdA gene was present in all the human isolates and in 86 % of subspecies I saurian isolates . 
SopE was found in 17 % of the human isolates , in 24 % of the saurian subspecies I strains and in all of the subspecies IV strains .

Lizards are known to be frequent carriers of Salmonella bacteria in their intestinal tract ( Zwart , 
1960 ; Zwart and Poelma , 1970 ; Cambre et al. , 1980 ; Greenberg and Sechter , 1992 ; Monzon Moreno et al. , 1995 ; Geue and Löschner , 2002 ) . 
Most of the Salmonella isolates from lizards belong to serovars , which are not usually encountered in mammals and birds ( Bäumler et al. , 1998 ) . 
The increasing popularity of these animals as pets coincides with an increased number of reptile-associated human salmonellosis cases ( Woodward et al. , 1997 ; Mermin et al. , 2004 ) . 
It is generally accepted that lizards constitute a reservoir of Salmonella strains from which homoeothermic animals can contract salmonellosis . 
It remains , however , unclear whether the strains carried by lizards show the same characteristics compared to typical mammalian isolates of subspecies I . 
It was therefore the aim of the present study to collect Salmonella strains from pet lizards , to characterize these strains and to compare them to human derived strains examining ( 1 ) the ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells ( 2 ) antimicrobial resistance patterns and ( 3 ) the presence of the virulence genes agfA , shdA , spvR , pefA and sopE .

Cloacal samples from 33 lizards from four private keepers and 79 faecal samples from lizard containing terraria from 3 pet shops and 1 zoological institution were collected . 
The samples were pre-enriched in buffered peptone water ( BPW ; Lab-M , Bury , UK ) for 24 h at 37 8C . 
After a 24 h enrichment in tetrathionate brilliant green broth ( TBG ; Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) at 37 8C , the samples were streaked on brilliant green agar plates ( Lab-M ) . 
Three colonies per plate with characteristics of Salmonella were further identiﬁed biochemically . 
Salmonella isolates were serotyped using single factor antisera . 
For further studies , one isolate per serotype per reptile collection was examined . 
For comparison , the reptilian isolates were compared to human isolates ( Table 2 ) . 
These strains were derived from human patients with salmonellosis . 
Antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined using the disk diffusion test on ISO Sensi-test Agar ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) . 
The following antimicrobial agents were tested : neomycin , tetracycline , ampicillin , nitrofurantoin , spectinomycin , trimethoprim , sulphonamides , chloramphenicol , gentamicin , apramycin , ﬂumequin , amoxicillin + clavulic acid , enroﬂoxacin , colistin , ceftiofur , all obtained from Rosco Diagnostics , Taastrup , Denmark . 
Bacteria were inoculated on blood agar plates and after overnight incubation at 37 8C suspended in 0.9 % NaCl to a 0.5 Mac Farland standard . 
The plates were inoculated with this suspension and after overnight incubation at 37 8C , zone diameters were measured and interpreted following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Invasion in human intestinal epithelial cells was assessed using a gentamicin protection assay on the human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line as described previously ( Pasmans et al. , 2004 ) . 
The invasion assays were performed in triplicate . 
The presence of the virulence genes agfA , shdA , spvR , pefA and sopE was determined using PCR as described in Pasmans et al. ( 2003 ) . 
The primers for the ampliﬁcation of the agfA , pefA , spvR , shdA and sopE gene were based on an alignment of all published sequences for Salmonella in public databases ( GenBank , EMBL ) , to provide speciﬁc PCR products of 400 , 450 , 310 , 810 and 380 bp , respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
The speciﬁcity of these primers has been tested by direct sequencing of the amplicons of one Salmonella strain and comparison with the respective published sequences as described previously ( Pasmans et al. , 2003 ) . 
At least one Salmonella serotype was isolated from 70 out of 112 samples ( 62.5 % ) and 180 isolates were obtained . 
From the cloacal samples 75.8 % were positive ; 60.0 % of the faecal samples yielded at least one Salmonella isolate . 
All the strains belonged to the species Salmonella enterica , subspecies I , II , IIIb or IV . 
Two different serotypes in the same sample were detected in 14 samples and three serotypes in two samples . 
Serotyping was performed on 180 isolates , yielding 4 strains of the subspecies salamae with the antigenic formula 9,46 : z : z39 , isolated from the lizard Ctenosaura palearis , corresponding to a new serovar of subspecies II recognized in 2003 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella ( Weill , Pasteur Institute , Paris , personal communication ) , 4 auto-agglutinating strains ( AA ) , 119 isolates belonging to 27 serotypes of subspecies I , 29 isolates belonging to 9 serotypes of subspecies II , 11 isolates belonging to 3 serotypes of subspecies IIIb and 13 isolates belonging to 5 serotypes of subspecies

For further studies 42 isolates of subspecies I , 15 isolates of subspecies II , 4 strains of subspecies IIIb and 6 subspecies IV isolates were used ( Table 2 ) . 
Two saurian strains , one of serotype Enteritidis and one of serotype Amsterdam , were resistant to nitrofurantoin . 
In the human strains , resistance to nitrofurantoin was detected in the serotype Enteritidis strain , resistance to sulphonamides in the serotype Urbana isolate and multiple resistance to tetracycline , ampicillin , spectinomycin and sulphonamides in the serotype Shubra strain . 
In none of the other strains , acquired resistance was detected . 
There was a tendency towards higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the 17 human strains compared to the 67 saurian strains ( Pearson Chi square , P = 0.04 ) .

All of the 67 saurian and 17 human strains tested were able to invade the Caco-2 cells . 
Saurian strains of subspecies I invaded the cells to a higher degree compared to strains belonging to subspecies II , IIIb and IV ( P < 0.05 ; Mann -- Whitney ) . 
The huma isolates invaded the Caco-2 cells to a lesser extent compared to their saurian counterparts ( borderline signiﬁcant : P = 0.05 , Mann -- Whitney ) . 
The agfA gene was present in all the strains examined . 
PefA was present in the human and the saurian strain of serotype Enteritidis resistant to nitrofurantoin . 
SpvR was present in the same serotype Enteritidis strains and in two strains of subspecies IV . 
ShdA occurred in all the human and in 86 % of the saurian strains of subspecies I . 
The sopE gene was found in 17 % of the human isolates and in 24 % of the saurian subspecies I strains and in ﬁve of six subspecies IV isolates . 
The distribution of the virulence genes agfA , shdA , sopE , pefA and spvR did not differ signiﬁcantly between the human and corresponding saurian isolates of subspecies I. Single bacteriological examination of saurian faeces and cloacal swabs yielded a high percentage ( 62.5 % ) of positive samples for Salmonella , belonging to 44 different serotypes of four different subspecies . 
This ﬁnding is in agreement with literature data ( Gopee et al. , 2000 ; Geue and Löschner , 2002 ) . 
Although not considered as a sensitive isolation method ( Cambre and McGuill , 2000 ) , single cloacal sampling yielded 75.8 % of positive samples . 
Because it was not the aim of this study to determine the prevalence of Salmonella infections in lizards , multiple samples were not collected . 
No clinical signs were noted in the lizards from which cloacal samples were collected , conﬁrming their role as asymptomatic carriers and possible reservoirs for humans ( Woodward et al. , 1997 ) . 
Compared to literature data of human isolates belonging to the most frequently isolated Salmonella serotypes such as Enteritidis , Typhimurium , Brandenburg , Hadar , Virchow and Infantis ( Van Looveren et al. , 2001 ) , the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance of the saurian strains was low . 
This might be due to lack of exposure of these strains to anthropogenic selective pressures ( Helmuth , 2000 ) . 
All of the strains examined were able to invade human intestinal epithelial cells . 
This ﬁnding is in agreement with the general consensus that every Salmonella serotype is able to invade the human intestine and cause disease depending for example on the patient 's age and immune status ( Aleksic et al. , 1996 ) . 
Interestingly , the invasive capacity was more pronounced in the saurian subspecies I serotypes as compared to the subspecies II , IIIb and IV strains . 
The subspecies I accounts for the vast majority of human salmonellosis cases . 
In mammals , successful colonisation coincides with invasion into epithelial cells and colonisation of lymphoid tissues ( Bäumler et al. , 1998 ) . 
In reptiles on the other hand , invasion into intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent colonisation of internal organs appear not to be necessary to establish an infection with Salmonella ( Pasmans et al. , 2002a , b ) . 
Therefore , inclusion of homoeothermic species in the host range of subspecies I serotypes appears to have co-evoluted with intestinal invasiveness . 
Surprisingly , the human Salmonella strains were found in smaller numbers in the Caco-2 cells than the saurian strains belonging to subspecies 1 . 
This ﬁnding is in line with previous observations that the magnitude of invasion does not necessarily correlate with the degree of adaptation of Salmonella to a certain host ( Bolton et al. , 1999 ; Uzzau et al. , 2001 ) . 
This lower magnitude of invasiveness of the human isolates might suggest that they belong to a distinct subpopulation . 
Ampliﬁcation of part of the agfA gene succeeded in all of the strains tested , supporting its value in diagnostic tests for Salmonella ( Doran et al. , 1993 ) . 
Thin aggregative ﬁmbriae , encoded by agfA , may be of special importance for lizards and other poiki-lothermic animals since they are generally expressed at lower temperatures ( up to 30 8C ) than mammalian or avian body temperatures ( DibbFuller et al. , 1997 ) . 
Possibly , at these relatively low temperatures , they might compensate for a slower multiplication rate by enhanced adhesion to the intestinal mucosa ( Pasmans et al. , 2002b ) .

For each strain , the subspecies ( Ssp . ) 
, serotype , animal species it was isolated from and the presence of Salmonella genes are presented . 
In mammals and birds , the spv virulence locus is required for sustained extra-intestinal infections and clinical disease through macrophage cytotoxicity and destabilization of the cytoskeleton of the eukaryotic cell ( Bäumler et al. , 1998 ; Libby et al. , 2000 ; Lesnick et al. , 2001 ) . 
The presence of the regulator gene spvR in only a limited number of the saurian isolates supports the hypothesis that extra-intestinal infections are scarce in lizards and do not appear to be crucial for sustained colonization . 
Lack of the shdA gene in subspecies II , IIIb and IV and in 14 % of the subspecies I saurian isolates suggests that this gene is of limited importance for persistence of Salmonella in the saurian intestina tract . 
In mammals the shdA gene , encoding a ﬁbronectin-binding protein ( Kingsley et al. , 2002 ) , is held responsible for prolonged shedding of subspecies I isolates with the faeces ( Kingsley et al. , 2000 ) . 
Its function in reptiles is not clear . 
The presence of the sopE gene , a translocated effector protein of the Salmonella type III secretion system I ( TTSS-I ) , was demonstrated in 24 % of the saurian subspecies I serotypes and in ﬁve of six subspecies IV serotypes . 
This ﬁnding is interesting since sopE is known to be present only in a subset of subspecies I strains ( Prager et al. , 2000 ) that , in the case of serotype Typhimurium , are associated with epidemics ( Mirold et al. , 1999 ) . 
Since isolates of subspecies IV are rarely associated with Salmonella epidemics in mammals , and since the necessity of the TTSS-I during infections of poikilothermic hosts is questionable , the reason for the presence of this gene in lizard-associated Salmonella strains is not clear . 
In conclusion , Salmonella infections are highly prevalent in captive lizards in Belgium . 
Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics suggested that these strains are capable of causing clinical infections in humans , emphasizing the role of lizards as potential reservoir for human salmonellosis .
