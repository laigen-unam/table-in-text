Indole is a reaction intermediate in at least two biosynthetic pathways in maize seedlings . 
In the primary metabolism , the a-subunit ( TSA ) of the bifunctional tryptophan synthase ( TRPS ) catalyzes the cleavage of indole 3-glycerol phosphate ( IGP ) to indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( G3P ) . 
Subsequently , indole diffuses through the connecting tunnel to the b-active site where it is condensed with serine to form tryptophan and water . 
The maize enzyme , BX1 , a homolog of TSA , also cleaves IGP to G3P and indole , and the indole is further converted to 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1 ,4 - benzoxazin-3 ( 4H ) - one , a secondary plant metabolite . 
BX1 cleaves IGP signiﬁcantly faster to G3P and indole than does TSA . 
In line with their different biological functions , these two evolutionary related enzymes differ signiﬁcantly in their regulatory aspects while catalyzing the same chemistry . 
Here , the mechanism of IGP cleavage by TSA was analyzed using a novel transition state analogue generated in situ by reaction of 2-aminophenol and G3P . 
The crystal structure of the complex shows an sp - hybridized atom corresponding to the C3 position of IGP . 
The 3 catalytic aGlu49 rotates to interact with the sp - hybridized atom and the 3 3 0 hydroxyl group suggesting that it serves both as proton donor and acceptor in the a-reaction . 
The second catalytic residue , aAsp60 interacts with the atom corresponding to the indolyl nitrogen , and the catalytically important loop aL6 is in the closed , high activity conformation . 
Comparison of the TSA and TSA-transition state analogue structures with the crystal structure of BX1 suggests that the faster catalytic rate of BX1 may be due to a stabilization of the active conformation : loop aL6 is closed and the catalytic glutamate is in the active conformation . 
The latter is caused by a substitution of the residues that stabilize the inactive conformation in TRPS .

Introduction
Tryptophan synthase ( TRPS ) is a bifunctional enzyme found in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic organisms that catalyzes the last two steps in the de novo biosynthesis of L-tryptophan . 
Its a and b-subunits are arranged in a linear abba fashion with the active centers of the a and b-subunits interconnected by a 25 Å long tunnel . 
The a-sub-1 unit catalyzes a retroaldol reaction in which indole 3-glycerol phosphate ( IGP ) is cleaved to indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( G3P ) ( a-reaction ) . 
Subsequently , indole diffuses through the connecting tunnel to the b-active site where it is condensed with serine to form tryptophan and water in a pyridoxal-5 0-phosphate ( PLP ) - dependent reaction ( b-reaction ) . 
In order to keep the two reactions in phase , the a and b-reactions regulate each other reciprocally by allosteric interactions . 
An important feature is the shuttling between open ( low-activity ) and closed ( high-activity ) conformations of the active sites , with the equilibrium depending on the ligands bound to the a-active site and the covalent intermediate formed at the b-active site . 
Although a wealth of structural , kinetic , and mechanistic data on TRPS is available and a great deal is known about the overall mechanism of the a and b-reactions , there are still a number of open questions . 
These include the details of the allosteric regulation , the mechanisms of the two reactions and the roles played by conformational change in modulating the activities of the a and b-catalytic sites . 
The a-reaction , the reversible cleavage of the C3 0 -- C3 bond of IGP to yield indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , is believed to proceed via `` push-pull '' general acid -- base catalysis . 
2 A possible a-reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 1 . 
The cleavage of the C3 0 -- C3 bond in IGP is activated by tautomerization of the indole ring to yield an indolenine tautomer , an intermediate which has a tetrahedral carbon at the C3 position . 
The tautomerization is probably facilitated by two catalytic groups , B1-H and B2 . 
B1-H protonates the indole ring at the C3 position , while B2 abstracts the proton on N1 of the indole ring . 
The actual bond cleavage yielding indole and D-glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate is then catalyzed by B3 , which removes a proton from the C 3 hydroxyl group . 
Extensive 0 biochemical and structural studies have been performed to identify the catalytically important groups B1-H , B2 and B3 . 
The ﬁrst clues suggesting catalytic or special substrate binding roles for aGlu49 and aAsp60 came from the crystal structure of TRPS from Salmonella typhimurium complexed with the inhibi-tor indole propanol phosphate . 
Their roles were 3 tested by Yutani et al. and Nagata et al. , 4 5 respectively , using site-directed mutagenesis . 
Both residues are highly conserved , aAsp60 occurs in the a domain of nine out of ten microorganisms as aligned by Crawford et al. , and in the a domain of 6 tryptophan synthase of Neurospora crassa . 
A 7 glutamic acid residue is located at the homologous position in the a subunit of Caulobacter crescentus . 
6,8 Since crystal structures show that the carboxylate of aAsp60 forms a hydrogen bond with the indole nitrogen atom of the non-hydrolyzable IGP analogue 3-indolepropanol 3 0-phosphate ( IPP ) , aAsp60 is a good candidate for the second catalytic group B2 . 
This observation is in line with the ﬁnding 3,9,10 that the aAsp60Asn mutant is catalytically inactive . 
aGlu49 is a site of missense mutation . 
5,11,12 Yutani and co-workers have obtained and 4,13 -- 18 analyzed a complete set of 19 mutants of the a-subunit of tryptophan synthase of Escherichia coli at position a49 . 
All 19 mutant proteins show no activity in the a-reaction . 
Crystal structures of wildtype and mutant forms of tryptophan 19 20,21 synthase from S. typhimurium complexed with the natural substrate , IGP , show that aGlu49 adopts an extended conformation and that its carboxylate forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group at C3 of IGP . 
Thus , aGlu49 was identiﬁed as the group 0 B3 ( Figure 1 ) , which catalyzes the aldol cleavage step and accepts a proton from the C3 0 hydroxyl of the glyceryl side-chain . 
So far , B1-H , the proton 6 donor for the indole C3 position , has not been identiﬁed unambiguously . 
It has been speculated that aGlu49 may perform this task as well , ﬁrst protonating the C3 position of the indole moiety ( B1-H function ) , and subsequently accepting the hydroxyl proton of the glycerophosphate moiety ( B3 function ) by suitable rotation within the active site . 
Crystal structures of TRPS complexed 5,12,20,22 with phosphonate-based a-reaction transition-state analogues have cast doubts on this hypothesis since the carboxylate of aGlu49 points away from the sp - hybridized sulfur atom in these complexes . 
3 23 These analogues were designed to mimic the putative tetrahedral transition state at the C3 atom of indole . 
There are two interpretations that 24 explain the orientation of aGlu49 in these structures : ( i ) aGlu49 does not act as B1-H , i.e. it does not protonate C3 , ( ii ) alternatively , the compounds used do not mimic the transition state of the a-reaction sufﬁciently well , so that the conformation allowing this interaction is not energetically favorable and thus observable . 
In order to distinguish between these possibilities and thereby to identify the nature of the B1-H group and the role of aGlu49 in the a-reaction mechanism , we determined the crystal structure of TRPS complexed with a novel transition state analogue . 
This compound is derived from 2-aminophenol ( 2AP ) , which functions as an analogue of indole , reacting in situ with G3P at the a-site to form a covalently bound adduct that resembles the transition state of the a-reaction due to its sp3 hybridization at the position corresponding to C3 of IGP . 
This adduct is a strong allosteric effector of reactions catalyzed by the b-site ( M. F. Dunn et al. , personal communication ) . 
An important feature of the a-reaction of TRPS is its tight allosteric regulation by ( and of ) the b-site , which is 25 Å away . 
The catalytic activity of the a-subunit is strongly inﬂuenced by interaction with the b-subunit . 
The free a-subunit has an activity that is approximately 30 to 100-fold lower than that of an a-subunit bound to the internal aldimine form of the a2b2 complex . 
Formation of the amino-25 ,26 acrylate intermediate at the b-active site further activates the a-subunit and increases the IGP cleavage rate another 30-fold or more . 
This is 27 -- 29 largely due to the induction of a closed , high activity conformation of the a active site , which 30 -- 33 is characterized structurally by an ordered conformation of loop aL6 . 
In the context of 9,10,21,34 allosteric regulation , it is obvious that a system can only be activated by ligand binding if the conformation of the ligand-free inactive form is more stable than the conformation of the ligand-free active form . 
In this context it is of interest that the catalytic aGlu49 can adopt two conformations , an inactive and an active one . 
The former , in which aGlu49 forms a hydrogen bond with the nearby aTyr173 , has been observed exclusively in complexes with a-substrate analogues lacking a 3 0 hydroxyl group such as 3-indolepropanol 3 0-phos-phate ( IPP ) . 
However , this conformation has 9,10 also been observed with partial occupancy in the Michaelis complexes of the wild-type enzyme and 19 the catalytically inactive aAsp60Asn mutant with 20 IGP , and as mentioned above , aGlu49 forms a hydrogen bond with the 3 OH group of IGP in the 0 active conformation . 
We hypothesize that regulation of a-subunit catalytic activity in the tryptophan synthase system 
Figure 1 . 
Proposed enzymatic mechanism of the a-reaction of TRPS . 
B2 likely is aAsp60 , while aGlu49 is believed t have a dual role as proton acceptor ( B1H ) and donor ( B3 ) . 
Scheme 1 . 
( a ) The free a-subunit is postulated to exist as an ensemble of stable , inactive conformations ( a ) in equilibrium with the unstable active conformation ( a * ) . 
( b ) Free a-subunit is activated by 30 to 100-fold by binding with the b-subunit to form E ( Ain ) . 
( c ) Reaction of L-Ser with E ( Ain ) to give E ( A-A ) stabilizes the a * conformation and gives an additional O30-fold activation . 
The overall activation of the a-subunit on conversion of the free a-subunit to E ( A-A ) is at least 1000 to 3000-fold , consequently , the fraction of free a-subunit in the form of a * must be less than 1/3000 to 1/1000 . 
For simplicity , an ab-dimeric unit of the tetrameric TRPS is shown in ( b ) and ( c ) . 
arises from the switching of the enzyme from an ensemble of enzyme forms dominated by inactive conformations designated as a ( in Scheme 1 only 0.033 to 0.10 % is in the active conformation , a * ) to the a2b2 internal aldimine form where the distribution is shifted 30 to 100-fold , giving 3.3 % of the a-subunit in active conformation , a * . 
We further hypothesize that conversion of the internal aldi-mine form to the a-aminoacrylate form causes an additional shift in distribution of a and a * , approaching w100 % of the active conformation . 
In the context of trying to understand the mechanism of the a-reaction and the regulation of the a-subunit activity within the a2b2 complex , we were interested in whether or not the observation of two conformations of aGlu49 is a built-in feature of the allosteric regulation mechanism . 
This question may be studied by analyzing enzymes that are related to TRPS but not allosterically regulated . 
In plants , there are other enzymes besides tryptophan synthase that cleave IGP to indole and glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate ; IGP serves as a branch point for different pathways . 
Two of these enzymes are involved in defense mechanisms ; the TRPS-alpha homologue from maize , BX1 , participates in DIMBOA ( 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1 ,4 - ben-zoxazin-3 ( 4H ) - one ) synthesis , and the homologue , IGL , is required for the production of free indole . 
35 The sequence alignments of BX1 , IGL and the TRP a-subunit from maize suggest that IGL and BX1 have been evolutionary modiﬁed from the a-sub-unit to serve in secondary metabolism . 
Indeed , the 36 enzymatic properties of BX1 and TRPS-alpha are different . 
Comparison of the apparent kcat for BX1 and E. coli TRPS demonstrates that BX1 produces indole 1400 times faster than the isolated TRPS a-subunit and 14 times faster than the bacterial TRPS complex . 
Potentially , there are several ways 35 of achieving this ; as depicted in Scheme 1 , one mechanism involves a destabilization of the inactive conformation of the TRPS-alpha enzyme by switching the enzyme to the active conformation through allosteric interactions arising from L-Ser reaction to give the a-aminoacrylate intermediate at the b-site . 
Elucidating the basis for such different enzymatic behavior has therefore also implications for the understanding of the regulation of TRPS . 
Consequently , we determined the crystal structure of BX1 and compared this structure to the structures of the alpha subunit of S. typhimurium TRPS with and without the 2AP adduct formed with G3P . 
Results and Discussion
Despite intense efforts to understand the molecular mechanism of the a-reaction of tryptophan synthase , the reversible cleavage of the C3 -- C3 0 bond of IGP to yield indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( Figure 1 ) , there are still open questions . 
In particular , the role of the catalytically essential aGlu49 is not fully understood . 
It has been observed in two conformations , an `` inactive '' one , where it points away from the active site , and an extended `` active '' one , where it forms a hydrogen bond with the 3 0 hydroxyl of IGP . 
Thus , aGlu49 is believed to act as the acceptor B3 ( Figure 1 ) of the hydroxyl proton of the glycerophosphate moiety . 
In contrast , the evidence that it also serves as B1-H , the proton donor for the indole C3 position , has been conﬂicting . 
In a previous study the presumed transition state of the reaction ( Figure 1 ) has been mimicked with ortho-substituted arylthioalkyl-phosphonate derivatives that have an sp - hybri-3 dized sulfur atom and lack the C2 atom to allow for higher conformational ﬂexibility . 
As expected , 23 some of these compounds bind with much higher afﬁnity than the natural substrate IGP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue IPP . 
However , in these putative tetrahedral transition state analogues designed to mimic the C3 atom of indole , the carboxylate of aGlu49 points away from the sp - hybridized sulfur atom . 
In this orientation , 3 aGlu49 is inappropriately positioned to function as either B1-H or B3 . 
To elucidate the function of aGlu49 we determined the crystal structure of wild-type TRPS complexed with a novel transition state analogue ( see Table 1 and Figure 2 ) that can only be generated in situ due to the instability of the tetrahedral adduct . 
Its characteristics were analyzed by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy .

mediated conformation changes in the a and b-subunits of tryptophan synthase . 
The ﬂuor-escence of ANS is strongly enhanced by binding to tryptophan synthase . 
The afﬁnity of the enzyme for ANS is strongly decreased by the binding of ligands to either the a or the b-sites . 
Consequently , the decrease in ANS ﬂuorescence can be used to determine the apparent afﬁnities of ligands for either the a or b-sites . 
The results of the ANS displacement studies presented in Table 2 demonstrate that the binding of 2AP is enhanced by the binding of G3P , and , as to be expected , the binding of G3P is also enhanced by the binding of 2AP . 
When the enzyme is incubated with a saturating concentration of G3P and the concentration of 2AP is varied the apparent dissociation constant for 2AP is enhanced 32-fold in comparison to the apparent dissociation constant measured in the absence of G3P ( Table 2 ) .

2AP and the concentration of G3P is varied , there is an apparent eightfold enhancement of the binding of G3P . 
This `` synergism '' is consistent both with the binding of 2AP and G3P to adjacent sub-sites at the a-site and with a bonding interaction between 2AP and G3P to form the 2AP-glycerol phosphate adduct , as shown by the crystal structure ( Figures 2 ( a ) and 3 ) . 
The 2-amino-phenol complex gives insight into the a-reaction mechanism 
The crystal structure of TRPS complexed with the covalent adduct of AP and G3P was determined to 1.5 Å resolution ( see Table 1 for details ) , allowing detailed insight into its geometric characteristics . 
Important features of this compound are ( i ) an sp - hybridized atom corresponding to the C3 3 position of IGP , ( ii ) a 3 0 hydroxyl group , and ( iii ) a hydrogen donor/acceptor at the nitrogen position of the indole ring . 
The compound , either 1 - [ 2-hydroxyphenylamino ] 3-glycerolphosphate or 1-2-aminophenoxy3-glycerolphosphate ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , was obtained in situ via the back reaction of TRPS using G3P and 2-amino phenol as substrates ( see Figure 2 ( a ) ) . 
This adduct can only be formed at the enzyme site , and is not stable free in solution . 
As shown in Figure 3 , there is clear electron density for the covalent adduct . 
Based on the electron density we can not distinguish between tetrahedral adducts derived from the attack of either the 2-amino phenol hydroxyl group or the amino group . 
Taking hydrogen bonding interactions and consistency with the presumed transition state into account , we favor the amino-linked compound ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) . 
The mechanistic inferences drawn below concerning this adduct do not depend upon knowing whether the adduct arises from N or O attack on the G3P carbonyl . 
For the purposes of this discussion , we assume that the adduct is the amino-linked compound . 
The binding mode of the adduct is similar to the one found in the complex with IGP , in particular , the side-chain of aGlu49 is in the extended , active conformation ( Figure 3 ) . 
However , there are a number of important differences , the most obvious one being that the atom corresponding to the C3 atom of IGP is sp - hybridized , as expected for the 3 transition state ( Figures 1 , 3 and 4 ) . 
This has two effects : ﬁrst , the position of the 3 0 hydroxyl differs and corresponds to a 908 rotation of the carboxylate of aGlu49 . 
This carboxylate forms two well-deﬁned hydrogen bonds , one with the sp - hybridized atom 3 ( OE2 -- N8 : 2.6 Å ) , the other with the 3 0 hydroxyl group ( OE1 -- O17 : 2.6 Å ) . 
These ﬁndings strongly support the hypothesis that aGlu49 serves as both B1-H and B3 in the a-reaction mechanism ( Figure 1 ) . 
The second effect of the sp - hybridization is a tiltin 3 of the phenyl ring compared to the indolyl ring of IGP . 
This tilting results in different positions of the phenolic hydroxyl of 2-amino phenol compared to the indolyl-nitrogen of IGP ( D 2.6 Å ) . 
Thus , the second catalytic residue , aAsp60 also moves to interact with the hydroxyl groups of 1 - [ 2-hydroxy-phenylamino ] 3-glycerolphosphate ( OE1 -- O7 : 2.6 Å ) and aThr183 ( OE1 -- OG1 : 2.8 Å ) , respectively . 
Due to the different position of the indolyl amino group in the IGP complex ( OE1 -- OG1 : 4.6 Å ) , the latter interaction is not possible , resulting in an open , disordered conformation of loop aL6 in the TRPS IGP complex . 
As depicted in Scheme 1 , ligand binding to the a-subunit is a two-step process consisting of an initial binding step and a subsequent isomerization to an activated form E * : 28,33 
Figure 3 . 
The crystal structure of TRPS complexed with the transition state analogue reveals interactions between the substrate and catalytically important residues . 
The sA-weighted 2FobsKFcalc electron density is shown at a contour level of 1.0 s for the transition state analogue , 2-AP-glycerol phosphate , and for nearby residues in the TRPS-2-amino structure . 
The side-chain of aGlu49 adopts the active conformation and forms two well-deﬁned hydrogen bonds , fully consistent with the hypothesis that aGlu49 serves both as B1-H and as B3 in the a-reaction mechanism ( see Figure 1 ) . 
The second catalytic residue , aAsp60 ( proposed to be B2 ) , interacts with the hydroxyl group of 2-AP-glycerol phosphate ( O7 ) ( 2.6 Å ) and aThr183-OG1 ( 2.8 Å ) .

with E representing an open conformation of the a-subunit while E * represents the closed conformation . 
The rate-limiting step in the forward reaction is the isomerization from the catalytically inactive ( E ) to the activated IGP complex IGP ( E * ) . 
We and others have put forward the IGP 28 hypothesis that an open aL6 corresponds to the inactive conformation of the a-active site ( e.g. TRPS ) , whereas the closed aL6 corresponds to IGP the activated conformation ( e.g. as observed in TRPS ) , which has been conﬁrmed by studies on IPP TRPS mutants that allow a direct correlation of kinetic and structural data . 
Despite this 19,21,34 important ﬁnding , the closed TRPS structure IPP did not allow insight into the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism since IPP ( and all other compounds with a group corresponding to the indolyl ring and inducing a closed conformation ) lacks the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol chain . 
For the ﬁrst time , the data presented here provide insight into the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism and allow extension of the above scheme by one more transformation , the transition state . 
The transition state conformation differs from the ground states by conversion to the active conformation of aGlu49 , which is induced by an sp - isomerization of C3 , and a rearrangement of the 3 glycerol chain and indolyl ring .

The BX1 structure
To gain insight into regulatory aspects of the allosteric bifunctional enzyme , we determined the structure of a monomeric homologue of the a subunit of TRPS , the BX1 protein from maize . 
35 BX1 cleaves IGP to produce indole , which is converted by four membrane-bound cytochrome P450 enzymes ( BX2-BX5 ) , a 2-oxoglutarate-depen-dent dioxygenase ( BX6 ) and an O-methyltransfer-ase ( BX7 ) to the benzoxazinoid 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1 ,4 - benzoxazin-3 ( 4H ) - one ( DIMBOA ) , an important defense chemical of plants . 
BX1 has 36 the canonical a/b - TIM-barrel fold , with a few 37 additional elements such as the a-helixes aH0 , aH0 0 , aH20 and aH80 ( see Figure 5 ) . 
BX1 is localized in the maize plastid , a transit peptide is eliminated during transport to the organelle , and Ala54 is found at the amino terminus of the mature protein . 
The transit peptide is part of helix aH0 . 
aH0 was identiﬁed as a transmembrane helix , and is not 35 present in the cloned , expressed , and crystallized construct described here . 
aH0 0 , aH20 , and aH8 have positions and play roles in BXI that correspond to the positions and roles found in the a-subunit of TRPS ( Figure 5 ) . 
A superposition of 10 203 homologous C positions gives an r.m.s. a deviation of 1.4 Å . 
An r.m.s.d. plot of the a-subunits of TRPS and BX1 shows that there are signiﬁcant differences in the positions of loops aL4 and aL5 , which belong to the a/b interface in TRPS . 
BX1 was crystallized from ammonium sulfate and contains a bound SO2K 4 located at the phos-phate-binding site that is hydrogen bonded with the hydroxyl group and backbone amide of Ser315 ( O1 ) , and the amides of Gly314 ( O2 ) , Gly293 , and Gly264 ( O3 ) . 
These interactions are analogous to those found between the phosphoryl groups of a-site ligands and Ser235 , Gly234 , Gly213 , and Gly184 , respectively , in complexes with TPRS . 
IPP In accordance with the latter interaction , loop aL6 is closed . 
This is surprising , given that the glycerol chain is missing , but phosphate has been shown to bind to the enzyme . 
Crystal structures of the a-subunit of TRPS alone and in the a2b2 complex
The catalytic activity of the a-subunit is strongly inﬂuenced by interaction with the b-subunit , suggesting a structural modulation . 
It is therefore of interest to compare structures of the a subunit as observed in the holoenzyme and alone . 
Crystal structures of the a2b2 complex have been determined of TRPS from S. typhimurium , and of the 3 isolated a subunits of TRPS from Thermus thermophilus ( pdb code 1ujp ) , P. furiosus , and 38 E. coli . 
The comparison is complicated by a 26 possible inﬂuence of crystal contacts on the conformation of the enzyme , in particular the functionally relevant loops aL2 and aL6 . 
They are disordered ( and free of crystal contacts ) in the a-subunit from T. thermophilus ( pdb code 1ujp ) . 
There are two molecules per asymmetric unit in the P. furiosus enzyme ( pdb code 1geq ) , aL2 is ordered in both molecules , aL6 is mobile in molecule A and ﬁxed by a crystal contact in molecule B ( residues B170 -- B172 are mobile ) . 
This results in a conformation that differs from the one observed in the closed form of the holoenzyme . 
The crystals of the E. coli enzyme contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit ( pdb code 1wq5 ) that are related by a 2-fold rotation . 
Residues A53 to A56 ( part of aL2 ) adopt an extended conformation and point into the region in molecule B that would be taken up by aL2 and aL6 in the closed conformation of the holoenzyme thereby preventing this conformation . 
Residues A57 to A64 are disordered , the conformation and orientation of residues A65 to A76 also interferes with the `` regular '' structure of aL2 and aL6 in molecule B. Due to the symmetric arrangement of the two molecules A and B , the conformation of residues B53 to B77 prevents the formation of aL2 and aL6 in molecule A. Nishio et al. dubbed the structure taken up by residues 52 to 26 77 `` loop-A '' . 
It is stabilized by a number of crystal contacts involving the second molecule in the asymmetric unit , sulfate , and symmetry-related molecules . 
In contrast , Nishio et al. hypothesized that the lack of stabilization of aH2 ( residues 61 -- 75 ) by the b-subunit induces formation of the loop-A conformation . 
aL6 is ordered except for residues 184 and 185 and stabilized by a crystal contact . 
Taking into account the structural data on the three different isolated a-subunits with the consideration of crystal contacts it seems that the low activity form ( see Scheme 1 ) is characterized by mobile loops aL2 and aL6 . 
In this context , the order of the loops in BX1 is remarkable and in line with the higher activity of the enzyme . 
Reaction mechanism of BX1
The superposition of the BX1 and aTRPS IPP structures shows that active site residues , which are sites of missense mutations in TRPS , are conserved in these two enzymes . 
Asp145 ( BX1 ) and Glu134 ( BX1 ) are structural equivalents of aAsp60 ( TRPS ) and aGlu49 ( TRPS ) , respectively . 
This ﬁnding suggests that TRPS and BX1 have similar mechanisms for IGP cleavage . 
However , BX1 is 14 times faster than the E. coli abba -- TRPS complex , and 1400 times more active than the 35 isolated TRPS alpha subunit . 
The reason may be 39 rooted in two features of TRPS described above , namely the occurrence of catalytically inactive and active conformations of aGlu49 and loop aL6 . 
There are two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the rhombohedral BX1 crystal form ; in both cases , the catalytic Glu134 is in the active conformation and loop aL6 is closed † . 
It is therefore suggestive that this preference for the active conformations correlates with the higher catalytic activity of BX1 . 
In TRPS the inactive conformation of aGlu49 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds ( Figure 6 ( a ) ) . 
The aGlu49 carboxylate group interacts with the hydroxyl group of aTyr173 ( 2.9 Å ) , water W21 ( 2.9 Å ) and water W6 ( 2.6 Å ) . 
W21 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen atom of aLeu48 ( 2.8 Å ) and with the hydroxyl of aTyr4 ( 2.4 Å ) . 
W6 interacts with aSer125-OG ( 2.8 Å ) and aLeu99-O ( 2.9 Å ) . 
In BX1 , aAla47 is replaced by Val132 , aTyr4 by Val89 , aGly98 by Val182 , aTyr173 by Phe253 and aLeu127 by Ile207 ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) . 
The side-chains of Val182 and Ile207 replace water molecules W21 and W6 , respectively , and form a hydrophobic cavity . 
In TRPS , the hydroxyl of aTyr173 interacts with aGlu49 and stabilizes the inactive conformation , whereas in BX1 the corresponding residue ( 253 ) is Phe . 
Furthermore , steric hindrance between Glu134 and the side-chains of Val182 ( 2.7 Å ) and Ile20 
† In the presence of IPP , BX1 crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal form . 
Also in this case , Glu134 is in the active conformation . 
Loop aL6 is involved in a crystal contact that stabilizes a well-deﬁned open conformation ( PDB code 1rd5 ) . 
Figure 6 . 
Environment of the catalytic glutamate . 
( a ) In TPRS , aGlu49 has two conformations , an extended active one interacting with the 3 - hydroxyl of IGP and an inactive one with the carboxylate hydrogen bonded with aTyr173 . 
( b ) In 0 BX1 ( yellow ) , Glu134 is positioned in the active conformation . 
Due to a number of substitutions , including Phe2534aTyr173 and Ile2074aLeu127 , the corresponding inactive conformation seen in TPRS is not energetically favorable in the BX1 structure 
( 2.8 Å ) also prevent the inactive conformation in BX1 . 
Sequence comparisons of the a-subunits of TPRS show that most of these enzymes do not contain the residues described above for S. typhimurium that are involved in stabilizing the inactive conformation of the catalytic glutamate , but rather they contain the ones found in BX1 ( see Supplementary Data ) . 
It is interesting to note that these two patterns seem correlated with the location of an arginine involved in stabilizing the circular , lid-like , closed conformation of loop aL6 . 
In S. typhimurium TRPS , this arginine , aArg179 , forms a number of radial , spoke-like , hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues a180 , a182 , a184 , and a187 ( Figure 7 ( a ) ) . 
BX1 has Val259 at the position corresponding to aArg179 in TRPS ; BX1 Arg266 , which corresponds spatially to aAsn187 in TRPS , is located at the opposite side of the loop . 
Thus , the guanidinium groups occupy similar positions , although Arg266 of BX1 is tilted out of the plane of the loop ( Figure 7 ( b ) ) . 
This tilting results in only one contact ( carbonyl Val262 ) and a much more looped out conformation of aL6 in BX1 . 
Based on this ﬁnding we predict that the class of TRPS with a-subunit structures resembling BX1 have faster kinetics for the a-reaction than do the enzymes falling in the class that includes E. coli and S. typhimurium , the only tryptophan synthases with known kinetics . 
When considered together , the structural results presented here on the TRPS structure of the complex of 2AP adduct and the structure of the a-subunit homologue , BX1 with the structures of free TRPS a-subunits provide strong evidence 26,38 that , as depicted in Scheme 1 , the regulation of a-subunit catalytic activity involves ab-subunit -- subunit and ligand -- subunit interactions that function to shift the ensemble of predominating inactive conformation ( s ) of the free a-subunit to the conformation of the activated form of the a-subunit that predominates in the a-aminoacrylate form of TRPS . 
The folding of the polypeptide chain residues into loop aL2 and aL6 , together with the correct alignments of aThr183 , aAsp60 and aGlu49 , are essential structural events in the transformation of the inactive ensemble of a-subunit conformations to the catalytically active state . 
Within the TRPS complex , these conformational transitions are driven by the conversion of the external aldimine to the a-aminoacrylate when L-Ser reacts at the b-site . 
30 In conclusion , use of a novel analogue of the tetrahedral transition state occurring during IGP cleavage in TRPS allowed us to conﬁrm the proposed catalytic function of highly conserved residues and to obtain a full picture of the reaction mechanism . 
In the transition state , the active site is fully closed . 
Plants have developed a plethora of defense mechanisms by adapting enzymes from the primary metabolism to new functions . 
Evolutionarily related to the a-subunit of TRPS is BX1 . 
Their structures are very similar including the active sites . 
However , BX1 cleaves IGP signiﬁcantly faster , which seems to be rooted in a systematic exchange of residues that stabilize the inactive conformation in a-TPRS . 
The occurrence of inactive and active structures is part of the allosteric regulation mechanism in TRPS . 
The elimination of this feature shows how gene modiﬁcation can produce enzymes that catalyze the same reaction directed towards different biochemical routes 
Figure 7 . 
The conformation of loop aL6 is determined by the position of an arginine residue . 
( a ) In a-TRPS , the guanidinium group of aArg179 lies in the plane of the loop and forms a number of radial interactions . 
( b ) In BX1 the corresponding guanidinium group , Arg266 , is tilted out of the ring plane , resulting in only one interaction with the loop . 
The two guanidinium groups occupy similar positions in space . 
Material and Methods 
G3P was purchased from Sigma , 2AP was obtained from Aldrich . 
All chemicals used were of the highest purity available . 
TRPS ( S. typhimurium ) was puriﬁed and crystallized as described . 
Equilibrium binding studies 10 to determine apparent dissociation constants for the binding of G3P and 2AP to the a-site of tryptophan synthase were performed using a Spex Fluorolog II spectroﬂuorometer equipped with a 150 W Xe light source . 
To minimize inner cell effects , all ﬂuorescent measurements used a 3.0 mm by 3.0 mm light path quartz cuvette ( Hellma ) . 
Binding was measured by observing the change in ﬂuorescence of the probe , ANS ( lexZ 340 nm , lemZ483 nm ) , arising from displacement by the titrating ligand . 
Experiments were performed with 32 either G3P or 2AP as the titrating ligand , or with the enzyme pre-incubated in solutions of either G3P ( 14.0 mM ) or 2AP ( 24.0 mM ) and the other ligand ( either 2AP or G3P ) as the titrating ligand . 
Owing to the low afﬁnity of 2AP and its limited solubility , it was not possible to incubate the enzyme with saturating amounts of this ligand . 
Solutions where 2AP was a ligand contained up to 5 % acetonitrile to solubilize 2AP . 
In a typical experiment , the titrating ligand , containing 10 mM enzyme sites , 100 mM Na , 13.0 mM ANS in 50 mM TEA C buffer ( pH 7.80 ) , was added to an identical solution lacking the ligand all at 25 8C . 
To minimize the adverse optical effects arising from oxidation of 2AP in aqueous solution by dissolved oxygen , 2AP was incubated with the enzyme solution for about ﬁve minutes prior to initiation of the titration , and the titrations were performed over a time period of ﬁve minutes or less . 
The resulting binding curves consisting of relative ﬂuorescence versus the total ligand concentration ( where [ ligand ] total [ [ enzyme sites ] ) were analyzed using PeakFit version 4 ( Jandel Scientiﬁc ) . 
The data were ﬁt to a hyperbolic expression of the form nZ [ L ] total / { KDappC [ L ] total } where n is the fraction of sites bound ( n ( DF/DFtotal ) ) , DF and DFtotal are the change in ﬂuorescence for any given ligand concentration and the total change in ﬂuorescence at saturation , respectively ; [ L ] total is the total ligand concentration ; and KDapp is the apparent dissociation constant . 
This equation assumes a stoichiometry of one ligand-binding site per ab dimeric unit and that the a-sites of the a2b2 tetrameric enzyme have identical and independent binding sites for the ligand , assumptions in good agreement with previous studies . 
32 
Crystallization , diffraction data collection , and reﬁnement of TRPS from Salmonella typhimurium 
TRPS was crystallized as described . 
For complex 10 formation , crystals were soaked in a solution adjusted to pH 7.8 containing 20 % ( w/v ) PEG 8000 , 20 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 75 mM Bicine buffer , solid 2-aminophenol , and 70 mM G3P for 20 minutes before cryo-cooling in liquid nitrogen . 
Diffraction data were collected at the ESRF ( Table 1 ) and processed with the XDS suite of programs . 
40 The data are 96.4 % complete to a resolution of 1.4 Å and have an Rsym value of 8.0 % . 
The starting model used for the reﬁnement with CNS 1.0 was a coordinate set of 41 TRPS-IPP ( PDB code 1QOP ) . 
The initial model was divided into three substructures ( a subunit , COMM domain , and the core of the b subunit ) and subjected to rigid body and simulated annealing . 
Coordinates for water molecules were found mostly automatically using the CNS 1.0 module WATERPICK . 
The occupancy for all solvent atoms was kept at unity throughout the reﬁnement . 
The ﬁnal model displays good stereochemistry ( Table 1 ) with R/Rfree values of 16.7 / 19.3 % . 
Expression, puriﬁcation, crystallization, diffraction data collection, and reﬁnement of BX1 from maize
For expression of BX1 ( residues 86 -- 348 ) , freshly 35 transformed E. coli clones were analyzed for good expression . 
Positive clones were plated , and used the next day as preculture ( one plate/liter minimal medium containing 50 mg/l of Se-methionine ) . 
Cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG at A 0.3 -- 0.4 , and grown for another three hours at 37 8C . 
After centrifugation and washing , cells were lysed using a ﬂuidizer . 
Puriﬁcation was done by Ni-NTA afﬁnity chromatography ( Quiagen ) using a buffered ( 50 mM NaH2PO4 ( pH 8.0 ) , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 10 % glycerin ) imidazole gradient ( 10 mM to 500 mM ) . 
BX1-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated using 3 M ammonium sulfate . 
The protein precipitated in the absence of phosphate and was signiﬁcantly less stable without glycerol . 
Therefore , the pellet was resuspended in 50 mM NaH2PO4 ( pH 7.0 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 10 % glycerin , and desalted using a NAP25 column ( Amersham ) . 
Concentration was done by Centriprep centrifugation ( Millipore ) . 
The protein ( 15 mg/ml ) was stored at K80 8C until further use . 
BX1 was crystallized at 20 8C using the hanging-drop geometry by mixing drops of equal volumes ( 1 -- 1.5 ml ) of protein ( 15 mg/ml protein in 50 mM NaH2PO4 ( pH 7.0 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 10 % glycerin ) and the reservoir solution ( 0.25 -- 0.4 M ammonium sulphate , 25 -- 30 % ( w/v ) PEG 2000 , 100 mM NaAc buffer ( pH 5.0 ) , also used as cryoprotectant ) . 
Large hexagonal crystals ( space group R3 , aZbZ123 .0 Å , cZ98 .8 , aZbZ908 , gZ1208 with two molecules per asymmetric unit ) grew within one week at 20 8C . 
The diffraction data listed in Table 1 were collected at 100 K at the ESRF and processed with the XDS suite of programs . 
The BX1-ammonium sulfate crystal form 40 displayed partial merohedral twinning ; the twin fraction ( see Table 1 ) was estimated as described by Yeates . 
Data 42 detwinning and molecular replacement calculations were performed with CNS 1.0 . 
Using a polyalanine model of the tryptophan synthase a-subunit as the search model , two clear solutions corresponding to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit were found . 
After rigid body reﬁnement , strong electron density was observed for an ammonium sulfate molecule bound at the phosphatebinding site of both monomers . 
Since the binding modes of ammonium sulfate ( BX1-AS ) and phosphate of IPP ( TRPS-IPP ) are similar , we modeled the position for IPP in BX1 followed by energy minimization using CNS 1.0 . 
For all models , map interpretation and manual rebuilding was done using the graphics program O 43 ( sA-weighted 2FobsKFcalc and FobsKFcalc difference synthesis at varying contour levels ) . 
After ﬁnal maximum likelihood reﬁnement to remove possible model bias , a composite omit map was calculated omitting 5 % of the model . 
Some solvent accessible residues exhibited very weak electron density and were modeled as alanine residues ( see Table 1 ) . 
Structure superposition
The superposition was done by the program O including all common C atoms for each pair of structure a except for the C atoms belonging to loop aL2 and loop a aL6 .
