Persistence of Salmonella on Egg Conveyor Belts Is Dependent on the Belt Type but Not on the rdar Morphotype
ABSTRACT Commercial caged layer ﬂocks in Alberta , Canada , are commonly monitored for Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) and S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium ( ST ) by environmental sampling . 
In one recent case , a SE strain isolated from the egg conveyor belt was a source of persistent infection for the ﬂock . 
This study was undertaken to examine Salmonella colonization on egg conveyor belts and to determine whether the rdar morphotype , a conserved physiology associated with aggregation and long-term survival , contributed to persistence . 
Four woven belts constructed of natural or nonnatural ﬁbers and a 1-piece belt made of vinyl were tested with rdar-positive ST and SE strains and a rdar-negative ST ∆ agfD reference strain . 
The type of egg belt was the most important factor inﬂuencing Salmonella colonization and

INTRODUCTION
Salmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne diseases worldwide . 
People are infected with Salmonella spp . 
through ingestion of a wide variety of contaminated foods , including meat , poultry , eggs and egg products , alfalfa sprouts , and unpasteurized juices ( Cook et al. , 1998 ; Burnett and Beuchat , 2000 ) . 
In North America , contaminated eggs and egg products are responsible for the largest number of human salmonellosis outbreaks ( Lynch et al. , 2006 ) . 
This trend has coincided with the rise of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) as one of the primary serovars causing gastroenteritis in humans ( Public Health Agency of Canada , 2005 ; Lynch et al. , 2006 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis strains are thought persistence . 
The vinyl belt , with the least surface area available for colonization , had the fewest Salmonella remaining after washing and disinfection , whereas the hemp-plastic belt , with the greatest surface area , had the most Salmonella remaining . 
Real-time gene expression indicated that the rdar morphotype was involved in colonizing the egg belt pieces ; however , it was not essential for persistence . 
In addition , rdar-positive and rdar-negative strains were equally similarly to disinfection on the egg belt pieces . 
The results indicate that Salmonella can persist on a variety of egg belts by mechanisms other than the rdar morphotype , and that using egg conveyer belts with reduced surface area for bacterial colonization can lessen contamination problems . 
to be particularly associated with eggs because they can infect the reproductive organs of laying hens without causing visible signs of illness ( De Buck et al. , 2004 ) . 
In addition , SE can persist in multiple environments in the hen house , making complete eradication difﬁcult ( Garber et al. , 2003 ; Gradel et al. , 2004 ; Wales et al. , 2006a , b ) . 
Salmonella spp . 
have strong persistence characteristics when compared with other gram-negative bacteria , such as Escherichia coli ( Winﬁeld and Groisman , 2003 ) . 
The rdar morphotype is one physiological adaptation conserved in Salmonella ( White and Surette , 2006 ) that occurs in response to environmental stresses , such as low osmolarity and nutrient limitation ( Gerstel and Romling , 2001 ; Weber et al. , 2006 ) . 
The rdar morphotype colonies are red , dry , and rough when grown on media containing Congo red , have elaborate surface patterns , and can be removed intact from the agar surface ( Romling et al. , 1998 ) . 
Cells aggregate within the colony through formation of an extracellular matrix in which thin aggregative ﬁmbriae ( Taﬁ ; curli ) , cellulose ( Romling et al. , 2000 ; Zogaj et al. , 2001 ; Solano et al. , 2002 ) , and other polysaccharides

2376 STOCK ( Gibson et al. , 2006 ) mediate aggregation between cells . 
The primary controller of the rdar morphotype is the transcriptional regulatory protein AgfD ( CsgD ) , which activates expression of the Taﬁ structural genes ( agfBAC ) and production of cellulose ( Zogaj et al. , 2001 ; White and Surette , 2006 ) . 
The presence of an extracellular matrix enhances the resistance of cells to desiccation ( Gibson et al. , 2006 ; White et al. , 2006 ) and resistance to antimicrobial agents such as sodium hypochlorite ( Solano et al. , 2002 ; Scher et al. , 2005 ; White et al. , 2006 ) , hydrogen peroxide , and acid ( Anriany et al. , 2001 ; Scher et al. , 2005 ) . 
Therefore , it is hypothesized that the rdar morphotype can contribute to the environmental persistence of Salmonella . 
Under the `` Start Clean-Stay Clean '' On-Farm Food Safety Program currently being implemented in the prov-ince of Alberta , Canada , layer ﬂocks are monitored for SE and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( ST ) strain DT 104 by environmental sampling . 
Alberta Agriculture and Food staff conduct environmental sampling investigations when positive tests are obtained and when normal cleaning and disinfection fails to restore a negative Salmonella status to a positive farm . 
In 2004 to 2005 , one commercial cage layer farm had persistent and recurring SE phage type 8 infections in the laying barn despite repeated disinfection of buildings and equipment . 
Agriculture and Food staff determined that the egg conveyer belt was the source of the contaminating SE strain . 
Past research has shown that egg conveyer belt samples are more likely to be contaminated with Salmonella than hen fecal samples ( Poppe et al. , 1991 ) . 
Egg belts are often exposed to Salmonella and represent a potential surface for adherence and persistence ; furthermore , in many battery cage setups , belts are not easily accessible for complete cleaning and disinfection . 
This study was performed to test 5 different types of egg conveyer belts made of vinyl , nylon , hemp , or plastic for their ability to resist colonization by Salmonella spp . 
In addition , we wanted to determine whether the rdar morphotype contributed to coloni-zation and investigate the efﬁcacy of commonly used disinfectants for eradication of Salmonella on the egg belt pieces . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 8 strain 11852 ( SE 11852 ) was isolated from a cage layer farm experiencing persistent SE contamination . 
Salmo-nella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 ( ST 14028 ) and an isogenic ∆ agfD mutant strain ( White et al. , 2006 ) were used as the rdar-positive and rdar-negative reference strains , respectively . 
Strains were routinely grown in Miller 's Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( 1 % salt ) , supplemented with 50 g/mL of kanamycin , if necessary , for 18 to 20 h at 37 °C with agitation before performing additional experiments . 
For growth of cells on agar , 1 L of culture was spotted onto solid 1 % tryptone ( T ) media 
( pH 7.2 ) containing 1.5 % Difco agar and incubated at 28 °C for 2 to 7 d. To visualize the production of cellulose , cells were grown on T agar containing 200 g/mL of Calcoﬂuor White ( ﬂuorescent brightener 28 ; Sigma-Ald-rich Canada , Oakville , Ontario , Canada ) . 
Colony pictures were taken with a Kodak Image Station 2000 mm camera system ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . 
Egg Belt Colonization Experiments
Experiments were designed to simulate contamination of the belts during production , followed by disinfection and drying , which would normally occur before a facility is repopulated with laying hens . 
Four belt types were named based on their composition : vinyl , plastic , nylon , and hemp-plastic . 
The ﬁfth belt , named the farmer 's belt , was made of hemp and was obtained from the contaminated layer facility investigated by Agriculture and Food staff . 
The vinyl belt was a single piece of vinyl , whereas the rest of the belts were of woven construction . 
Following the experimental model of Ryu and Beuchat ( 2005 ) , each belt was cut into 1 cm2 pieces and sterilized by autoclaving ( vinyl , nylon , and farmer 's belt ) or immersed in 70 % ethanol for 2 h and dried in a biosafety cabinet ( plastic and hemp-plastic belts ) . 
For inoculation , cells from 200-mL overnight cultures were sedimented by centrifugation ( 4,500 × g , 10 min ) , resuspended in 0.5 % T to a concentration of ∼ 2 × 1010 cells per mL ( A600 of 20 ) and spotted in 50 - L aliquots ( ∼ 109 cells ) onto the egg belt pieces . 
Each group of 15 belt pieces , from a total of 45 pieces of each belt type for each Salmonella strain , was stored as sets of 5 in 3 Petri plates and incubated at 28 °C for 7 d before processing or treatment . 
For treatment , 20 mL of water ( pH 7 ) or 0.1 % Virkon S ( Antec International , Suffolk , UK ) in water was added to each Petri dish and mixed slowly for 10 min on a linear shaker . 
Water or Virkon solution was removed by pipetting and replaced with 20 mL of water ( pH 7 ) . 
After 10 min , water was removed and belt pieces were incubated at 28 °C for an additional 7 d. For processing , pieces were transferred to sterile 16 × 125 mm borosilicate culture tubes containing 1 mL of PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and cells were rehydrated for 1 h . 
After vortexing for 30 s , 0.5 mL of the cell mixture was removed and mixed in a tissue homogenizer for 20 s. Each sample was serially diluted in triplicate and plated in duplicate in 5 - L drops onto LB or T agar and incubated at 28 °C overnight . 
Spots with 5 to 50 colonies were counted and used to determine the number of viable cells ( cfu ) . 
Statistical Analysis
Egg belt colonization and persistence data were evaluated with nonparametric tests because the assumptions of parametric tests were violated . 
Therefore , data were described by using medians , and even after logarithmic transformation , interquartile ranges and were analyzed in a log10 format . 
Data from each Salmonella strain were analyzed separately . 
For each belt type , differences were 
Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy
Glass coverslips ( 18 × 18 mm ) were mounted onto environmental scanning electron microscopy ( ESEM ) stubs as described by Sibley et al. ( 2006 ) with glue containing colloidal graphite ; following drying at room temperature ( RT ) , cover slips were sputter-coated with 5 nm of gold by using a Hummer sputter coater ( Anatech USA , Hayward , CA ) . 
Inoculated egg belts were mounted onto the coverslips with the same glue , making sure to connect the glue from the egg belt to the bottom of the stub to prevent charging . 
The egg belt pieces were coated with an additional 2 nm of gold . 
Samples were viewed with a Philips XL30 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope at 3 to 4 Torr , with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV . 
Recombinant DNA Techniques and Construction of Luciferase Reporters
Deoxyribonucleic acid containing agfD and agfB promoter regions was PCR ampliﬁed from SE 11852 by using primers agfD1 and agfD2 ( White et al. , 2006 ) , sequentially digested with XhoI and BamHI ( Invitrogen Canada Inc. , Burlington , Ontario , Canada ) , and ligated into pCS26-Pac ( XhoI-BamHI ) or pU220 ( BamHI-XhoI ) reporter vectors containing the luxCDABE operon from Photorhabdus luminescens ( Bjarnason et al. , 2003 ) . 
Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing was performed by the University of Calgary Core DNA services ( http://dnaservices.myweb.med.ucalgary.ca/ ) by using primers pZE05 and pZE06 ( Bjarnason et al. , 2003 ) . 
The ST 14028 agfB and synthetic RpoS ( σS ) - responsive luciferase reporters have been described previously ( White et al. , 2006 ) . 
The control σ70 promoter ( sig70-7 ) has the sequence 5 ′ - CTCGAGAATAATTCTTG ATATTTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATTTTACGTGCAATT GGATCC-3 ′ and was cloned into the XhoI-BamHI sites of pCS26 as described previously ( Kim and Surette , 2006 ) . 
This was one of several control σ70-dependent promoters selected from a library constructed with the above sequence with 4 degenerate positions in the promoter ( underlined ; K. Pabbaraju and M. G. Surette , University of Calgary , Calgary , Alberta , Canada , unpublished data ) . 
RT Gene Expression-Bioluminescence Assays
For bioluminescence assays in culture , overnight cultures were diluted 1 in 600 in T broth supplemented with 50 g/mL Kan to a ﬁnal volume of 150 L in 96-well , clear-bottomed black plates ( 9520 Costar , Corning Inc. , Corning , NY ) . 
The culture in each well was overlaid with 50 L of mineral oil prior to starting the assays . 
Cultures were assayed for luminescence ( 0.1 s ) and absorbance ( 620 nm , 0.1 s ) every 30 min during growth at 28 °C with agitation in a Wallac Victor instrument ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences , Boston , MA ) . 
For bioluminescence assays on egg belts , ST 14028 and SE 11852 reporter strains were resuspended in 0.5 % T to a concentration of ∼ 2 × 1010 cells per mL and serially diluted 1,000-fold . 
Aliquots of 50 L of cells , at each density , were inoculated onto egg belt pieces in 24-well , clearbottomed black plates ( Black Visiplate-24 TC , Perkin El-mer ) . 
Luminescence ( 1 s ) was measured continuously ( ∼ 8 min between reads ) at room temperature in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux instrument ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) until the inocula had dried onto the belts . 
The ∆ agfD reporter strains were included as controls . 
Each reporter strain was tested in duplicate at each cell density , and experiments were repeated twice . 
Exposure of rdar Morphotype Colonies to Disinfectants
Colonies were removed from the T agar surface and stored in 24-well tissue culture plates ( 1 colony per well ) at 28 °C for 7 d. Colonies were hydrated in 500 L of PBS for 1 h at RT , and 100 L of disinfectant solution ( to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.025 to 1.0 % ) or PBS was added and mixed continuously by using a rotating microtube mixer for 10 min at RT. . 
Cells and colony materials were centrifuged ( 7,000 × g , 2 min ) and the supernatant was removed . 
A 500 - L quantity of fresh PBS was added , and colony slurries were mixed in a tissue homogenizer until uniform turbidity was reached ( ∼ 20 s ) . 
To determine the number of colony-forming units remaining in each sample , cell mixtures were serially diluted in triplicate , plated in duplicate in 5 - L drops onto LB agar , incubated at 28 °C overnight , and the colony-forming units enumerated . 
RESULTS
Colonization and Persistence of 2 S. enterica Strains on 5 Different Egg Belt Types
To determine whether the composition and architecture of egg conveyer belts could affect Salmonella colonization and contribute to persistence , we tested colonization of 5 different belt types with SE 11852 and ST 14028 . 
For both strains , initial colonization values were signiﬁcantly different across the different belt types despite inoculation of the same number of cfu on each belt piece . 
The farmer 's belt had the lowest number of cfu remaining , whereas the vinyl belt had the highest number ( Figure 1 ) . 
Controls for cell survival conﬁrmed that the drop in cfu was due to cell death after incubation at 28 °C for 7 d and not from an inability to dislodge the cells by vortexing ( data not shown ) . 
The water wash treatment tested the persistence of Salmonella on the different belt types ( Figure 1 ) ; in each case , the drop in Salmonella cfu caused by washing was statistically signiﬁcant from the initial colonization values . 
The vinyl belt pieces had a signiﬁcant drop in Salmonella cfu ( > 3 log10 units ) compared to the other belt types , whereas the farmer 's belt had the smallest drop in cfu , of ∼ 1 log10 unit , which was statistically different from all other belt types except the hemp-plastic belt . 
Disinfection with Virkon , a peroxygen-based disinfectant ( McDonnell and Russell , 1999 ) , was effective on all belt types , with signiﬁcant cfu reductions compared with the water-treated samples ( Figure 1 ) . 
The vinyl , nylon , and farmer 's belts all had large reductions in cfu after treatment with Virkon ; for the vinyl belt , counts for 12 of 15 pieces were below the limits of detection . 
The hempplastic belt retained signiﬁcantly more cells than the nylon , vinyl , and farmers belts for ST 14028 and all other belts for SE 11852 . 
Results for the 2 S. enterica strains mirrored each other for all treatment groups . 
Overall , the vinyl belt was the most resistant to Salmonella colonization and persistence , whereas the hemp-plastic belt was the least resistant . 
calculated between the median log10 cfu from the initial Plasmids were transformed into Salmonella strains by eleccolonization group and log10 cfu values for each belt piece troporation ( Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. , Hercules , CA ) . 
in the groups treated with water or Virkon . 
Differences were also calculated between the median log10 cfu of the water-treated group ( also reﬂecting differences in initial colonization ) and the log10 cfu of each belt piece in the Virkon-treated group . 
The log10 cfu differences were compared across belt types by using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a series of Mann-Whitney U-tests . 
For each strain , 30 multiple comparisons were performed for each outcome ; therefore , a Bonferroni correction was used and statistical signiﬁcance was noted if P < 0.0017 ( = 0.05 / 30 ) . 
Analyses were conducted with a commercial statistical software package ( SPSS v. 15.0.0 for Windows , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . 
Analysis of Colonized Egg Belt Pieces by ESEM
Salmonella colonization of the egg conveyor belt pieces was further examined by ESEM . 
When belts were compared before inoculation with Salmonella , the primary difference was the amount of surface area available for colonization . 
The vinyl belt had less surface area than either the plastic or hemp-plastic belt ( Figure 2 ) . 
The hempplastic belt was estimated to have the greatest surface area because of the stringy nature of the hemp ﬁbers . 
The nylon belt was intermediate in surface area , and the farmer 's belt was similar to the hemp-plastic belt ( data not shown ) . 
Both S. enterica strains formed bioﬁlms on the belt surfaces after inoculation ( Figure 2 ) . 
The lack of scattered cells or clumps of cells indicated that the bacteria were adhering to each other as well as to the belt materials . 
Cells ﬂattened out into a layer on top of both the vinyl and plastic belts , and cells could be clearly differentiated from the belt surface ( Figure 2 ) . 
In contrast , it was hard to differentiate between the ﬁbers and cells on the hemp-plastic belt ( Figure 2 ) . 
Raised areas of cells were observed on the vinyl belt ( Figure 2 ) , although it was not determined if these areas represented differentiated bioﬁlm structures or artifacts caused by the drying process . 
SE 11852 Expresses the rdar Morphotype
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 11852 colonies were rough and dry with characteristic surface patterns ( Figure 3A ) , had the ability to bind Calcoﬂuor , and could be lifted off the agar surface intact ( data not shown ) , similar to the rdar-positive ST 14028 strain ( Romling et al. , 1998 ; Zogaj et al. , 2001 ) . 
This indicated that SE 11852 was capable of producing both Taﬁ and cellulose . 
However , SE 11852 colonies were noticeably smaller than ST 14028 colonies ( Figure 3A ) . 
To conﬁrm that SE 11852 was positive for the rdar morphotype , expression of an agfB promoter : : lux reporter was measured during growth in liquid media ( Figure 3B ) . 
Maximal agfB gene expression for SE 11852 occurred after 30 h of growth , similar to ST 14028 ; however , the maximum expression was only half that of ST 14028 ( Figure 3B ) . 
The drop in SE 11852 agfB expression was attributed to a change in the promoter region of agfD ( data not shown ; see White and Surette , 2006 ) . 
When SE 11852 and ST 14028 expression proﬁles were normalized to account for magnitude differences , the proﬁles were nearly identical ( data not shown ) .

Expression of the Salmonella rdar Morphotype on Egg Belt Pieces
Real-time agfB expression in ST 14028 and SE 11852 was analyzed after cells were inoculated onto plastic belt pieces and allowed to dry . 
To assess cell growth , expression from synthetic promoter : : lux fusions dependent on either RpoD ( σ70 ) or RpoS ( σ38 ) activity was monitored . 
Maximal expression of the σ70 and RpoS-responsive reporters for both S. enterica strains increased as increasing numbers of cells were used ( Figure 4A ) . 
In contrast , agfB expression reached the highest level at the 108 cfu inoculum , followed by the 107 ( ST 14028 ) or 109 cfu ( SE 11852 ) inocula ( Figure 4A ) . 
Despite differences in the magnitude of expression , temporal expression proﬁles showed clear agfB activation at each of the 109 , 108 , and 107 cfu inocula for both ST 14028 ( Figure 4B ) and SE 11852 ( data not shown ) . 
In each experiment , there was an increase in sigma factor activity over time , followed by a time lag prior to agfB expression as the media evaporated to dryness ( Figure 4B ) . 
Overall , these results provide evidence

Ability of a Salmonella rdar Morphotype-Negative Mutant to Colonize Egg Belt Pieces
We tested colonization of egg conveyor belts by an ST 14028 ∆ agfD strain unable to produce Taﬁ and additional extracellular components ( Romling et al. , 1998 ; Zogaj et al. , 2001 ; White et al. , 2006 ) . 
The ∆ agfD cells were recovered at numbers similar to wild-type ST 14028 after initial colonization ( data not shown ) . 
The ∆ agfD cells on the vinyl and hemp-plastic belts displayed a more patchy covering of the egg belt pieces than was observed with the wild-type strains ( Figure 5A ) . 
High-magniﬁcation ESEM pictures revealed that the ∆ agfD strain was surrounded by abundant extracellular material but lacked the ﬁbrous network seen between cells of the parent strain ( Figure 5B ) . 
Despite the patchy colonization observed , the ∆ agfD mutant was only marginally easier to wash off the egg belt pieces than the ST 14028 and SE 11852 strains ( data not shown ) . 
In addition , the ∆ agfD and ST 14028 strains were equally susceptible to Virkon treatment on the nylon and hemp-plastic egg belts ( Figure 5C ) . 
Survival of ∆ agfD was reduced by ∼ 2.5 log10 units on the plastic egg belt and by ∼ 1 log unit on the farmer 's belt as compared 10 with ST 14028 ( Figure 5C ) , demonstrating that the type of egg belt material can inﬂuence the efﬁciency of disinfection .

Values for ∆ agfD on the vinyl belt pieces after disinfection were below the 200-cfu detection limit of the assay . 
Names of the egg belt types are listed below the graph . 
Effect of the rdar Morphotype on Salmonella Survival When Exposed to Common Agricultural Disinfectants
To determine whether the ST 14028 and ∆ agfD strains had different inherent resistances , we examined Salmo-nella survival when exposed to 3 different disinfectants commonly used in poultry barns , Virkon , chlorophenol ( One-Stroke Environ Pro-Ag Products Ltd. , Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada ) , and Quat-O-Germ ( W. E. Greer Ltd. , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) . 
Treatments with a range of disinfectant concentrations were tested on colonies transferred to plastic and incubated at 28 °C . 
After 7 d , there were 10-fold fewer viable ∆ agfD cells as compared with the parent strain ( Figure 6A , 6B , and 6C ) . 
Upon exposure to 0.0625 and 0.125 % Virkon , approximately 1 log10 unit of ∆ agfD cells was killed , whereas the ST 14028 cell numbers did not change appreciably ( Figure 6A ) . 
When Vir-kon was increased to 0.25 % , a greater than 5 log10-unit difference in cfu was observed ; ∆ agfD cfu counts dropped below the limits of detection , whereas ∼ 107 ST 14028 cells were viable ( Figure 6A ) . 
Similar results were obtained for SE 11852 ( data not shown ) . 
Differences between the 
ST 14028 and ∆ agfD strains were also observed with the Quat-O-Germ and chlorophenol disinfectants ; ∆ agfD viability was reduced by at least 5 orders of magnitude when colonies were treated with 0.25 % Quat-O-Germ ( Figure 6B ) or 0.1 % chlorophenol ( Figure 6C ) . 
Overall , chlorophenol appeared to be the most effective disinfectant , with complete killing of both strains at 0.2 % ( Figure 6C ) , whereas Quat-O-Germ was the least effective . 
DISCUSSION
This study was performed to examine the colonization and persistence of Salmonella on egg conveyor belts used in caged layer farms . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteriti-dis-contaminated egg belts have been associated with SE infections in caged layer ﬂocks , for example , in up to 50 %

We tested 5 different types of belts by using a high-cfu inoculum to ensure that cells would remain on the belt pieces after washing and a low disinfectant concentration that would kill some , but not all , of the contaminating Salmonella . 
Under these conditions , the type of egg belt proved to be the most important factor in colonization and persistence . 
The available surface area of the belts was inversely correlated with the efﬁciency of washing and disinfection ; the vinyl belt had the least surface area and reduced Salmo-nella persistence , whereas the 4 woven egg belts had elevated levels of Salmonella . 
Results with the farmer 's belt were not entirely consistent with the other belt types ; the surface area and resistance to water treatment were similar to the hemp-plastic belt , yet lower numbers of Salmonella were recovered at the initial colonization step and after Virkon treatment . 
We think these results can be explained by the presence of residual disinfectants on the farmer 's belt , because this belt was used for more than 9 years in a commercial layer facility . 
Overall , it was evident that belt ﬁbers could prevent dislodging of cells during washing and potentially shield them from disinfection . 
In a practical sense , these results show that resistance to disinfection of Salmonella spp . 
on surfaces is strongly inﬂuenced by the type of surface ; therefore , materials should be chosen carefully to reduce potential contamination problems . 
In selecting an egg belt , the commercial farmer must consider several factors , including egg belt cost , durability , and ability to resist contamination . 
The vinyl belt appears to be the best belt for reducing Salmonella persistence . 
A confounding issue in the past was the lack of durability and the increased cost of vinyl belts compared with belts made of woven material . 
However , considering that there is a recent elevation in the importance of SE-and ST-free laying barns , and the costs associated with continual environmental contamination , the utilization of smoother-surfaced egg belts may warrant a recommendation by Egg Marketing jurisdictions in Canada . 
Real-time gene expression analysis indicated that the rdar morphotype was involved in the colonization of egg belts . 
For both ST 14028 and SE 11852 , agfB ( Taﬁ ) expression was detected as the inocula dried onto the belt pieces . 
The time lag prior to agfB activation was interpreted to represent a period of cell growth corresponding to an increase in σ70 and σS activity . 
It was unexpected that both sigma factors would be active under these drying conditions , because they compete for binding to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and each drives expression of a distinct subset of genes ( Hengge-Aronis , 2002 ) . 
However , the interplay between σ70 and σS under environmental conditions is not well understood . 
The agfB expression was assumed to be activated in response to nutrient limitation , as reported previously ( Gerstel and Romling , 2001 ) , and possibly in response to desiccation ( White et al. , 2006 ) . 
As conﬁrmation of these results , the presence of an extensive Taﬁ and cellulose network was observed between individual cells on the egg belt pieces .

Figure 6 . 
Survival of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( ST ) 14028 and ∆ agfD cells in colonies after treatment with 3 common agricultural disinfectants . 
Colonies grown on tryptone agar and stored for 1 wk on plastic were rehydrated and treated with different concentrations of Virkon ( Antec International , Suffolk , UK ; A ) , Quat-O-Germ ( W. E. Greer Ltd. , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) ; B ) or chlorophenol ( One-Stroke Environ Pro-Ag Products Ltd. , Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada ) ( C ) for 10 min . 
Each point represents the average number of surviving cells per colony and SEM , corresponding to 4 individual colonies . 
2382 STOCK Despite the involvement in colonization , the rdar morphotype did not play a big role in persistence under the conditions of our experiment . 
Cells of the ∆ agfD strain were not more easily dislodged from egg belts than ST 14028 or SE 11852 . 
This ﬁnding was surprising , because ∆ agfD strains are known to have reduced cell-cell aggregation ( Romling et al. , 1998 ; Romling et al. , 2000 ) and colonization of abiotic surfaces ( Uhlich et al. , 2006 ) . 
It is possible that a longer incubation period for Salmonella on the egg belts would have resulted in a greater difference between strains , because the rdar morphotype allows cells to survive in the environment for months without exogenous nutrients ( White et al. , 2006 ) . 
The ∆ agfD strain was also expected to be more susceptible to disinfection ( Scher et al. , 2005 ; Uhlich et al. , 2006 ; White et al. , 2006 ) , yet this was true on only 2 of the 5 belt types . 
Together , the washing and disinfection results seemed to contradict the RT expression data . 
One complicating factor was that the highest agfB expression for ST 14028 and SE 11852 was recorded when 108 cfu were inoculated onto the belt pieces , not at 109 cfu as tested in our experiments . 
We repeated the egg belt experiment by using an inoculum of 108 cfu , but similar results were obtained ( data not shown ) . 
Although it is possible that the rdar morphotype may enhance Salmonella survival in other environments within the barn , such as feces , cage dust , feed hoppers , and soil ( Garber et al. , 2003 ; Wales et al. , 2006a , b ) , bioﬁlm formation and colonization is a complex process ( Austin et al. , 1998 ; Romling et al. , 2003 ; Barak et al. , 2005 ; Latasa et al. , 2005 ; Solomon et al. , 2005 ; Lapidot et al. , 2006 ) . 
Treatment with Virkon , a disinfectant commonly used in the agricultural industry , was effective at reducing Salmonella contamination on colonized egg belts . 
Complete disinfection was not achieved because Virkon was used at 0.1 % , 10 times below the concentration recommended by the manufacturer . 
Killing of all strains was increased on the vinyl and nylon egg belt pieces , proving again that the type of surface can inﬂuence Salmonella persistence . 
The ST 14028 and ∆ agfD strains had differential susceptibilities at 0.25 % Virkon when grown as colo-nies , with the ∆ agfD strain being ∼ 5 log10 units more susceptible . 
This inherent strain difference was also observed with Quat-O-Germ , a quaternary ammonium sanitizer , and chlorophenol , a phenol-based disinfectant . 
Vir-kon acts by oxidation of proteins and other cytoplasmic components , whereas Quat-O-Germ and chlorophenol cause damage to the bacterial inner membrane primarily ( McDonnell and Russell , 1999 ) . 
The different susceptibilit-ies observed could reﬂect a difference in Salmonella grown on agar vs. egg belts . 
It is possible that ∆ agfD cells on egg belts were able to produce cellulose and other poly-saccharides in an AgfD-independent manner , as has been reported for E. coli ( Da Re and Ghigo , 2006 ) . 
The order of efﬁcacy of the 3 disinfectants tested on Salmonella colonies was chlorophenol > Virkon > Quat-O-Germ . 
Based on the survival results , treatment of egg conveyor belts with disinfectants at the manufacturer 's recommended concentrations should eliminate Salmonella contamination , although the presence of additional organic matter , such as feather dust , and particularly egg yolk from broken and cracked eggs , could interfere with the efﬁcacy of disinfection ( Gradel et al. , 2004 ; Wales et al. , 2006a ) . 
It is difﬁcult to recreate or evaluate `` real-world '' contamination situations experimentally , such as SE infections in caged layer farms , because of the myriad factors that affect contamination , disinfection , and persistence . 
Garber et al. ( 2003 ) established that one potential risk factor on SE-positive farms was the presence of mice harboring SE infections . 
Our experiments were based on an example in which the egg conveyor belt was a reservoir for persistent SE infections . 
The results demonstrate that the type of belt material used can inﬂuence Salmonella persistence . 
The vinyl belt offered no more than a smooth surface for the organisms to grow , hence the relative ease of bioﬁlm removal compared with the multiplied surface area for growth on the woven belts . 
With woven belts , greater dependence on the use of detergents and disinfectants may be required to reduce Salmonella numbers , along with ensuring the presence of additional physical conditions , such as elevated temperatures and low pH , to enhance their efﬁcacy . 
Further research should be performed to test the efﬁcacy of other disinfectants , such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde ( Gradel et al. , 2004 ) , as well as to examine the role of egg contents in environmental bioﬁlm formation on egg conveyor belts . 
Understanding Salmonella colonization and persistence in these and other natural environments will undoubtedly help to combat the spread of these important pathogens and eventually lead to reduced Salmonella-associated human illness .
