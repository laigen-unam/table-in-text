Abstract 
Transgenic tobacco plants were produced that express an anti-Salmonella enterica single-chain variable fragment ( scFv ) antibody that binds to the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) of S. enterica Paratyphi B . 
The coding sequence of this scFv was optimized for expression in tobacco , synthesized and subsequently placed behind three different promoters : an enhanced tobacco constitutive ubiquitous promoter ( EntCUP4 ) , and singleand double-enhancer versions of the Cauliﬂower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter ( CaMV 35S ) . 
These chimeric genes were introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv . 
81V9 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and 50 primary transgenic ( T0 ) plants per construct were produced . 
Among these plants , 23 were selected for the ability to express active scFv as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using S. enterica LPS as antigen . 
Expanded bed adsorption-immobilized metal afinity chromatography ( EBA-IMAC ) was used to purify 41.7 lg of scFv/g from leaf tissue . 
Gel ﬁltration and surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) analyses demonstrated that the puriﬁed scFv was active as a dimer or higher-order multimer . 
In order to identify T1 plants suitable for development of homozygous lines with heritable scFv expression , kanamycin-resistance segregation analyses were performed to determine the number of T-DNA loci in each T0 plant , and quantitative ELISA and immunoblot analyses were used to compare expression of active and total anti-Salmonella scFv , respectively , in the T1 generation . 
As S. enterica causes millions of enteric fevers and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year , large-scale production and puriﬁcation of this scFv will have potential for uses in diagnosis and detection , as a therapeutic agent , and in applications such as water system puriﬁcation . 
Introduction
The expression of recombinant antibodies ( rAbs ) and rAb fragments in transgenic plants is recognized for potential cost-effective Ab production and puriﬁcation for growing market demands ( Hiatt et al. , 1989 ; Peeters et al. , 2001 ; Fischer et al. , 2004 , 2003 ) . 
Bacteria , yeast , animals and animal cells are major expression systems for these molecules ( Hudson , 1998 ; Houdebine , 2002 ; Hudson & Souriau , 2003 ; Krauss 2003 ; Schillberg et al. .

2003 ; Wurm , 2004 ) ; however , each system has its own limitation . 
Bacteria are incapable of producing full-length Abs , which require extensive folding , post-translational modiﬁcation and multimeric assembly ; also , dificulties may arise in separating Abs from bacterial toxins ( Schillberg et al. , 2002 ; Schillberg et al. , 2003 ; Baneyx & Mujacic , 2004 ) . 
Yeast systems lack the ability to eficiently produce properly folded Abs , and have low yields ( Peeters et al. , 2001 ; Mayﬁeld et al. , 2003 ; Schillberg et al. , 2003 ) , although recent successes are reported with ﬁlamentous fungal systems ( Gerngross , 2004 ) . 
Monoclonal Ab ( mAb ) yields from animals ( i.e. , milk , eggs ) is in the range of 0.4 -- 14 g/L ( Peeters et al. , 2001 ) ; however , the possibility of contaminating an Ab with zoonotic pathogens exists ( Fi-scher et al. , 2003 ) . 
Finally , mammalian cells are the pharmaceutical industry standard for mAb production ( Wurm , 2004 ) , but this process can be expensive and slow ( Schillberg et al. , 2002 ) . 
Transgenic plants offer several advantages for Ab production . 
They can secrete , fold and modify proteins in ways similar to those of mammalian cells ( Sheedy & Hall , 2001 ; Fischer et al. , 2004 ; Gomord & Faye , 2004 ) , and there is reduced potential for zoonotic contamination ( Fiedler et al. , 1997 ; Schillberg et al. , 2003 ) . 
Abs produced in plants can also be modiﬁed to provide better biological features and produced in large quantities for applications in environmental remediation ( Kim et al. , 2002 ; Stranchan et al. , 2002 ; Kramer and Hock , 2003 ) , plant protection ( Smolenska et al. , 1998 ; Schillberg et al. , 2001 ; Almquist et al. , 2004 ; Peschen et al. , 2004 ) and medicine . 
We chose an anti-Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi B scFv for production in tobacco plants . 
A mAb ( i.e. , Se155 -- 4 , Anand et al. , 1991a , b ; Cygler et al. , 1991 ) was originally developed that binds to the abequose-mannose element of the Salmonella serogroup B antigenic determinant ( Bundle et al. , 1994 ) . 
A scFv ( i.e. , B5-1 , Deng et al. , 1995 ) was developed from this with two point mutations ( i.e. , Met34Ile and Gly109Ser ) that shifted it from a monomer to a dimer , resulting in high binding afinity for S. enterica Paratyphi B . 
The goals of this research were high-level expression of this scFv , to determine whether transgenic tobacco plants would make the active dimer , and to identify the best candidates for development of homozygous lines for potential large-scale production . 
Methods, results and discussion
Transgenic tobacco plants expressing anti-S. enterica serotype Paratyphi B scFv
The B5-1 scFv coding sequence ( Deng et al. , 1995 ) was modiﬁed for optimal expression in tobacco . 
The Arabidopsis basic chitinase signal sequence ( Samac et al. , 1990 ; GenBank Accession AY081519 ) , and QCRL-1 ( Hipfner et al. , 1996 ) , 6xHis and KDEL ( Wandelt et al. , 1992 ) tags were added to the amino and carboxyl termini , respectively . 
The entire 885 bp sequence ( GenBank Accession AY320047 ) , including preferred tobacco codons , was synthesized and subcloned between the EntCUP4 promoter ( Foster et al. , 1999 ) and the nos terminator in pBIN19 ( Bevan , 1984 ) . 
Single - and double-enhancer CaMV 35S promoters were PCR-ampliﬁed from pFF19 ( Timmermans et al. , 1990 ) using primers 35S-HindIII ( 5 cents - AGTGCCAAGCTTGCCAACA-3 cents ) and 35S-XbaI ( 5 cents - CGCGGTCTAGAAAGCTC-GAGAGAGAGATAGATTTG-3 cents ) , and subcl-oned to replace EntCUP4 . 
Binary plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain At542 by electroporation prior to transformation of low-alkaloid Nicotiana tabacum cv . 
81V9 ( Hors-ch et al. , 1986 ; Miki et al. , 1999 ) . 
Fifty plants for each construct were selected on kanamycin ( 50 mg/L ) , and screened for expression of the anti-S . 
enterica scFv by ELISA according to Almquist et al. ( 2004 ) using 100 lg/mL S. enterica Typhimurium B LPS as speciﬁc antigen ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) and Penta.His ( QIAgen ) as primary detection Ab . 
Five T0 plants with the EntCUP4 promoter , eight with the single-enhancer and 10 with the double-enhancer 35S promoter were selected as the highest expressers of active scFv . 
Speciﬁcity of the scFv from these plants was further demonstrated by negative ELISA results using non-speciﬁc LPS from S. enterica serotype Minnesota ( not shown ) . 
Analysis of B5-1 scFv expression
EntCUP4 T0 plants were produced 4 months earlier than 35S promoter T0 plants , therefore a comparison of the relative amounts and activities of recombinant scFv required that T1 seedlings be used . 
Pooled T1 sibling plantlets will have a average number of T-DNA loci approximating that of the original T0 plant . 
For instance , T1 progeny of a single-locus T0 plant would have a 1:2:1 offspring ratio of homozygous : hemizygous : null-homozygous genotypes at the T-DNA locus , resulting in an average of one T-DNA locus per genome equivalent . 
Approximately 200 T1 seeds from each of the 23 T0 plants , and from cv . 
81v9 as a control , were cultured on non-selectable agar medium . 
After 4 weeks , three replicates of tissue ( 400 mg each ) were harvested from each lawn of T1 seedlings . 
The relative protein concentration was determined for all samples , and these were adjusted to the same relative concentration . 
ELISA was performed to measure relative scFv binding activity per replicate ( Figure 1a -- c ) . 
Total scFv expression was subsequently measured for T1 seedlings by pooling the three replicate extracts from each line and performing SDS-PAGE followed by quantitative immunoblot analysis , as described by Almquist et al. ( 2004 ; Figure 1d -- f ) . 
Expression and activity of scFv in the T1 generation of all ﬁve EntCUP4 T0 plants was severely reduced ( Figure 1a and d ) . 
In contrast , expression and activity were still high in seven of eight single-enhancer plants ( numbers 8 , 9 , 13 , 16 , 17 , 18 and 19 ; Figure 1b and e ) , and in ﬁve of 10 double-enhancer plants ( numbers 24 , 28 , 30 , 31 and 43 ; Figure 1c and f ) . 
Post-transcriptional gene silencing ( PTGS ; Neuhuber et al. , 1994 ; Depicker & Van Montagu , 1997 ; Jones et al. , 1999 ) is a likely explanation for the reduction of transgene expression in double-enhancer 35S plants in the T1 generation , as this phenomenon is typical of a strong , constitutive promoter ( Elmayan & Vaucheret , 1996 ) . 
For e.g. , double-enhancer plant 34 showed no active or total scFv in the T1 generation ( Figure 1c and e ) ; this plant line should be especially susceptible to PTGS as quantitative real-time PCR analysis ( not shown ) estimated 25 T-DNA copies in the T0 progenitor . 
We have not investigated the reason for decreased expression levels among the Ent-CUP4 plants , but suggest transcriptional gene silencing ( TGS ) as a possible cause because tCUP sequences are similar to RENT sequences ( repetitive elements from Nicotiana tabacum ; 93 % identity over 365 nucleotides ; data not shown ) . 
If T-DNA insertions occured near methylated RENT sequences in the tobacco genome , tCUP sequences may therefore become methylated , leading to TGS ( Ingelbrecht et al. , 1999 ) . 
Although it would be reasonable to suggest that the EntCUP4 plantlets produced very little scFv due to their age ( 4 weeks ) or being raised on agar medium , we suggest these possibilities are unlikely because one EntCup4 T1 family was grown to maturity in a greenhouse , and ELISAs performed on over 20 individuals showed they all had no active scFv ( unpublished ) . 
Nickel afinity puriﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of B5-1 scFv
Protein extractions from 100 g of leaves from each of three T0 plants , i.e. , single-enhancer plants 7 , 18 and 19 , were pooled and subjected to EBA-IMAC ( Jiang & Hearn , 1996 ; Valdes et al. , 2003 ; Sahin et al. , 2005 ) . 
ScFv was eluted in a buffer containing 300 mM imidazole and fractions of 6 mL were collected and assayed for activity . 
Ten ELISA-positive fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in comparison with the crude starting material ( Figure 2a ) . 
The concentration of puriﬁed scFv was estimated using quantitative immunoblot technology , in comparison with known amounts of 6xHis Protein Ladder standard ( QIAGEN ) . 
A single 30 kDa band was detected with the Penta.-His Ab ( Figure 2b , arrow ) , whereas wild-type control extract did not contain an immunopositive band ( not shown ) . 
Densitometric analysis indicated 41.7 lg of puriﬁed scFv/g of mature leaf biomass . 
Identiﬁcation of the puriﬁed scFv was further veriﬁed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry , since 114 of the 287 amino acids in the scFv sequence were inferred from the masses of ﬁve peptide fragments ( not shown ; Bauer & Kuster , 2003 ) . 
Active B5-1 scFv is a dimer or higher-order multimer
Preparations of the anti-Salmonella scFv expressed in tobacco and E. coli ( not shown ) were separated by Superdex 75 ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscata-way , NJ ) gel ﬁltration chromatography . 
Note that scFv expressed in E. coli , as described by Deng et al. , ( 1995 ) , did not contain the C-terminal KDEL , 6xHis and QCRL-1 tags . 
UV traces were read at 280 nm and peaks containing expected monomers , dimers and higher-order multimer were identiﬁed by comparative elution with a protein size standard ( Figure 2c ) . 
SPR analyses were performed with a BIACORE 3000 biosensor system ( Biacore , Inc. , Piscataway , NJ ) on fractions containing these peaks to determine whether they contained active scFv ( Figure 2d ) . 
BSA-S . 
enterica Essen O-chain ( serogroup B ) was immobilized at a surface density of 9000 response units ( RUs ) on research grade CM5 sensor chips ( Biacore ) at a concentration of 100 lg/mL in 10 mM acetate , pH 4.5 , by amine coupling according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The reference surface had 10,000 RUs of BSA immobilized under the above conditions . 
Analyses were carried out at 25 C in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) containing 150 mM 
NaCl and 3 mM EDTA at a ﬂow rate of 20 lL / min . 
Chip surfaces were regenerated with 100 mM HCl for 3 s. Gel ﬁltration and SPR analyses showed that active B5-1 scFv from E. coli eluted as a dimer or higher-order multimers in one major peak , which was divided into four fractions ( EF1 through E4 ; Figure 2c and d ) . 
Several plant fractions were collected that had scFv activity : PF2 , co-eluted with higher-order multimers ; PF3 , with the dimer ; PF4 , with the monomer ( Figure 2d ) . 
SPR showed that scFv from PF2 , PF3 and EF3 had high functional afinity for the S. enterica Essen B O-chain , as indicated by their slow dissociation phases ( Figure 2d ) . 
Expanded response traces on the right of Figure 2d indicate that PF4 displayed weaker functional afinity for bound antigen , and PF5 through PF7 had no afinity , as they had rapid dissociation phases . 
These results are consistent with published data on this scFv , which show the dimeric form has higher binding afinity ( KD = 8 · 10 ) 8 M ) 1 ) than the monomer ( KD = 4 · 10 M ; Deng et al. , 1995 ) , presumabl ) 6 ) 1 due to increased avidity . 
Our results indicated that the active scFv expressed by tobacco was predominantly a dimer or higher-order multimer . 
Some of the T1 lines expressed scFv with less functional activity than others , even though they expressed similar amounts of total scFv . 
For e.g. , double-enhancer lines 24 and 30 had similar total scFv ( Figure 1f ) , yet line 24 expressed only half the active scFv of line 30 ( Figure 1c ) . 
Single-enhancer lines 7 , 9 and 13 showed a similar trend ; i.e. , all three lines showed similar activity ( Figure 1b ) , while line 9 expressed only half the total scFv of the other two ( Figure 1e ) . 
It is possible that some of the T1 lines expressed proportionately more monomeric than dimeric or higher-order anti-Salmonella scFv , and thus their apparent reduction in functional scFv activity was due to differences in overall avidity ( Arndt et al. , 1998 ) . 
We have not investigated this phenomenon further .

Identiﬁcation of T1 seed suitable for development into lines expressing B5-1 scFv
T0 tobacco plants were characterized to determine T1 seed that would be suitable for development into lines that express functional scFv . 
The number of T-DNA loci in each T0 plant was estimated by kanamycin-resistance segregation analysis ( not shown ) , where approximately 200 T1 seeds from each T0 plant were cultured on MS agar medium containing kanamycin ( 100 mg/mL ) . 
After 5 weeks , ratios of resistant to susceptible seedlings were determined and the numbers of T-DNA loci were calculated , based on Mendelian inheritance models for one to four independently segregating loci . 
This method showed 12 of the scFv-express-ing T0 plants contained only one genetic locus with an active nptII gene , while eight had two loci and three had three loci ( Figure 1g ) . 
For the development of such lines , transgenic plants should have heritable , high expression of functional scFv and contain a small number of T-DNA copies or loci . 
After self-pollination , lines would be developed from homozygous T plants . 
1 Single-locus homozygotes improve the chances of maintaining high scFv expression levels since the possibility of gene silencing is reduced ( Meyer & Saedler , 1996 ) ; multilocus T-DNA plants can over-express the T-DNA-encoded mRNA , resulting in PTGS ( Flavell , 1994 ) . 
In addition , T0 plants with single T-DNA insertions are much easier to develop to homozygosity . 
Although 10 of 12 single-locus T1 families expressed measurable active and total scFv , those from single-enhancer T0 plants 8 and 19 , and from double-enhancer plants 31 and 43 are the best candidates for development of homozygous lines ( Figure 1 ) .
