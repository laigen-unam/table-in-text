Abstract 
In this study , we used four different cell lines , with or without presenilin-1 or -2 , to investigate the hypothesis that the presence of presenilin , the most prominently mutated gene in Alzheimer s patients , affects the infection rate of host cells by Salmonella . 
The invasion and replication of Salmonella in presenilin 1/2-de ﬁcient cells were signiﬁcantly lower than those in presenilin 1/2-expressing cells . 
Among several presenilin-interacting proteins , the expression of ﬁlamin-A in presenilin 1/2-de ﬁcient cells was signiﬁcantly lower than in presenilin 1/2-expressing cells . 
However , Salmonella infection of ﬁlamin-A-deﬁcient M2 cells did not signiﬁcantly differ from infection of ﬁlamin-A-containing A7 cells , ruling out the possibility that ﬁlamin-A is a major protein inhibiting Salmonella invasion and replication . 
It is of interest to note that Hes-1 expression , a downstream target of Notch signaling pathway , was signiﬁcantly decreased by Salmonella infection . 
Our results demonstrate that the presence of presenilins affects the invasion and replication processes of Salmonella .

Salmonella causes a variety of diseases , ranging from localized gastroenteritis to more severe systemic host speciﬁc illnesses , such as typhoid fever in humans and genetically susceptible mice [ 13 ] . 
The ﬁrst appearance of a Salmonella-induced cellular response includes increased membrane ruﬄing and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements in host cells that result in bacterial invasion [ 3 ] . 
However , the possibility that the infection rate with Salmonella correlates with the age-related Alz-heimer s disease has not been addressed to date . 
Insights into the mechanisms underlying AD originate from the identiﬁcation of mutations in three genes : amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) gene on chromosome 21 , preseni-lin 1 ( PS 1 ) on chromosome 14 , and presenilin 2 ( PS 2 ) on chromosome 1 [ 6,10,11 ] . 
The interaction between presenilins and cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as ﬁlamin-A and b-catenin has provided insights into the functions of presenilin proteins in the invasion of Salmonella . 
In this study , we found that the invasion and replication of wild type Salmonella in MEF cells depend on the presence of presenilins but not on ﬁlamin-A . 
The downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway was significantly decreased by Salmonella infection . 
These results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the presence of presenilin affects the invasion and replication processes of Salmonella . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and cell lines . 
The Salmonella typhimurium strains used in this study derived from the virulent wild type strain derived from 14028s , carrying lacZP : : GFP : : CAT fusion on its chromosome between nucleotides 1213521 and 1214240 ( SHJ 2033 , manuscript in preparation ) . 
PS 1 / , PS 2 / , PS 1/2 / , and PS 1/2 + / + cell were kindly obtained from Dr. Strooper and maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco s modiﬁed Eagle s medium ( DMEM ; GibcoBRL ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin ( Sigma ) . 
Filamin A-deﬁcient M2 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in minimum essential medium Eagle ( MEM , Sigma ) containing 8 % newborn calf serum and 2 % fetal calf serum . 
The A7 cells were cultured in the presence of G418 ( 500 lg/ml ) . 
Phagocytosis assay . 
Mammalian cells were seeded at the density of 5 · 105 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates 24 h before use . 
Before infection , Salmonellae cultured overnight were diluted 40-fold in LB and grown for another 4 h at 37 C under vigorous shaking . 
Bacterial inoculums were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min followed by direct resuspension of the pellet in warm DMEM + 10 % FBS . 
The inoculums were diluted and added to mammalian cells at MOI indicated in the text for 30 min at 37 C in 5 % CO2/95 % air . 
After infection , extracellular bacteria were removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
Fresh DMEM + 10 % FBS , containing 20 lg/ml gentamicin , was added and the infected cells were incubated at 37 C in 5 % CO2/95 % air for the remainder of the experiment . 
For enumeration of intracellular bacteria ( CFU ) , the host cells were washed three times with PBS , lysed with 0.05 % Triton X-100 for 10 min , and serially diluted and plated on BHI agar . 
CFUs were determined after incubation of the plates at 37 C. Western blot assay . 
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 % deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris -- Cl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 10 lg/ml leupeptin , 5 lg / ml aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF ) . 
For Western blotting , 20 lg of whole cell extracts was separated by 8 % SDS -- PAGE and transferred onto hydrophobic polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Amersham ) . 
The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % non-fat milk buffer , washed in TBST buffer , probed with the appropriate primary antibodies , and detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) system ( Amersham ) . 
The primary antibodies used in this study selectively recognize F-actin ( 1:500 , Chemicon ) , b-catenin ( 1:20,000 , Sigma ) or ﬁlamin-A ( 1:1000 , Chemicon ) . 
Immunostaining assay . 
Cells ( about 2 · 105 cells per microscope cover glass , Fisher ) were cultured for 16 h in media with 10 % FBS and infected with bacterial culture . 
After infection with Salmonella for 2 and 8 h , cells were washed three times with 1 · PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 -- 20 min before washing and permeabilizing with 0.01 % Triton X-100 in 1 · PBS . 
The presence of ﬁlamin A was detected with the monoclonal antibody MAB1680 ( Chemicon ) . 
Filamentous actin was detected with rhodamine -- phalloidin ( Molecular probes ) . 
b-Catenin was detected with a polyclonal antibody ( Sigma ) . 
Reporter assay . 
Cells ( 2 · 105 ) in a 12-well plate were transiently transfected by Lipofectamine with expression vectors for HES-1 of the downstream target of notch , and TOPFLASH of Wnt downstream target genes , as indicated under Results . 
In addition , some cells were indicated with Salmonella ( MOI of 100 ) after transfection . 
Luciferase activity was determined 12 h after transfection using a luciferase assay kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . 
Luciferase activity of each sample was normalized by b-galactosidase activity for transfection eficiency . 
Assays were carried out in triplicates .

Invasion and replication of wild type Salmonella depend on the presence of presenilin . 
( A ) Cells were infected with wild type Salmonella ( MOI of 100 ) and allowed to phagocytose for 30 min . 
Colony counting assays were performed to assess phagocytosis of Salmonella ( 0 -- 8 h ) . 
( B ) Cells were infected with wild type GFP-expressing Salmonella for either 2 or 8 h ( as indicated ) , and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . 
The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin . 
Numbers of intracellular Salmonella were counted at each time point , and the statistical differences of intracellular Salmonella counts in PS 1 / , 2 / , and 1 / 2 / MEFs were compared with those in PS 1/2 + / + MEFs and analyzed by t test . 
* P < 0.05 ; ** P < 0.01 . 
( Fig. 1 ) . 
At 0 h , when each of the PS cells was allowed to undergoes phagocytosis , the invasion of Salmonella in presenilin 1/2-de ﬁcient MEFs ( PS 1/2 / ) was 7.2 · 104 CFU , 2.7 times lower than that in the PS 1/2 + / + cells . 
The replication rate of Salmonella , however , signiﬁcantly differed among four presenilin cell lines , as determined by the number of intracellular Sal-monella up to 8 h . 
The number of Salmonella at 8 h increased 23-fold in PS 1/2 + / + cells but only 4.2-fold in PS 1/2 / cells . 
Furthermore , PS 1 and/or PS 2-deﬁcient cells showed lower invasion and replication infection than PS 1/2 + / + cells ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Fluorescence microscopy images consistently revealed that Salmonella failed to replicate in PS 1/2 / cells when compared with PS 1/2 + / + cells , suggesting that presenilin primarily affects the intracellular replication of Salmonella . 
Results
Invasion and replication of wild type Salmonella in MEF cells were signiﬁcantly dependent on the presence of presenilin 
The level of Filamin A in PS 1/2 / MEFs was signiﬁcantly lower than that in PS 1/2 + / + MEFs , which itself does not explain the lower invasion and replication of Salmonella in PS 1/2 / MEFs 
In this report , we used four mouse embryonic ﬁbro-blasts ( MEFs ) differentially expressing presenilin-1 or -2 ( PS 1 / , PS 2 / , PS 1/2 / , and PS 1/2 + / + ) to compare the rate of Salmonella invasion and replication 
With the above observation that intracellular replication of Salmonella required presenilin , we speculate that the protein ( s ) that interacted with presenilin may be directly or indirectly implicated in the intracellular rep-lication of Salmonella . 
b-Catenin and ﬁlamin-A are important in the regulation of the actin ﬁlament complexes . 
Thus , we compared the levels of these preseni-lin-interacting proteins , by extracting endogenous proteins from four different cell lines ( PS 1 / , PS 2 / , PS 1/2 / , and PS 1/2 + / + MEFs ) and measuring their levels using speciﬁc antibodies [ 1 ] ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Wes-tern blot analyses revealed that the PS 1 / and PS 1/2 / cell types contained lower levels of ﬁlamin-A than the PS 1/2 + / + cell type ( Fig. 2B ) . 
RT-PCR results indicated that decreased ﬁlamin-A in PS 1/2 / MEFs is a consequence of decreased protein stability rather than decreased transcription . 
As decreased levels of ﬁl-amin-A coincide with lower invasion and replication of Salmonella in PS 1/2 / MEFs , we analyzed the direct effect of ﬁlamin-A on Salmonella infection . 
In these studies we employed a ﬁlamin-A-deﬁcient cell line ( M2 ) and a ﬁlamin-A-replete human melanoma cell line ( A7 ) . 
Different patterns of Salmonella invasion and replication in M2 and A7 cells were determined by microscopy and phagocytosis assays ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Surprisingly , the phagocytosis assay revealed the similar patterns of invasion and replication of Salmonella in M2 and A7 . 
The invasion and replication of Salmonella were only 1.3-fold higher in M2 compared with A7 . 
These results indicate that the presence or absence of ﬁlamin-A does not affect the invasion and replication of Salmonella . 
Fig. 3 . 
The presence of ﬁlamin-A did not affect the invasion and replication of wild type Salmonella . 
( A ) M2 ( ﬁlamin-A-deﬁcient ) and A7 ( ﬁlamin-A-repleted ) cells were infected with wild type Salmonella for 8 h and then ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . 
F-actin was visualized by staining with rhodamine-labelled phalloidin . 
( B ) M2 and A7 were infected with wild type Salmonella , and colony-counting assays were performed to assess phagocytosis . 
* P < 0.05 , relative to ﬁlamin A-deﬁcient cells ( M2 ) . 
Salmonella infection blocked Notch-related signaling in PS 1/2+/+ cell lines
The presenilins are part of the molecular machinery responsible for Notch cleavage in the membrane and are involved in the regulation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway . 
We analyzed the expression of downstream targets of the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways after Salmonella infection . 
We analyzed activities of Hes-1 and TOPFLASH luciferase reporter containing CSL and LEF-1 binding sites in the promoter region , a known target of Notch and Wnt pathways , respectively . 
The Hes-1 ( CSL binding ) and TOPFLASH ( LEF-1 binding ) promoter-luciferase constructs were transfected into PS 1/2 / and PS 1/2 + / + cell lines and infected with Salmonella . 
It is of interest to note that luciferase activities of both Hes-1 and TOPFLASH were higher in PS 1/2 + / + cells than in PS 1/2 / cells . 
However , the reporter activities of TOPFLASH promoter in two cell lines were not signiﬁcantly affecte by Salmonella infection , whereas Salmonella infection , signiﬁcantly decreased Hes-1 promoter activity in PS 1/2 + / + cell lines compared with control cells ( Fig. 4 ) .

Endogenous levels of F-actin , b-catenin , and ﬁlamin-A in different PS 1/2 MEF cells . 
( A ) Endogenous proteins of each presenilin cell were detected in the whole cell lysate by Western blot assay . 
Even loading of each protein was conﬁrmed with direct blue 71 staining ( EZ BiopaQ , Korea ) . 
( B ) Immunostaining microscopy was performed to detect F-actin , b-catenin , and ﬁlamin A. ( C ) Endogenous ﬁlamin-A in each cell differentially expressing presenilins was detected by RT-PCR . 
Discussion
The mechanism underlying the effect of presenilin 1 on the invasion and replication of Salmonella in host cells was addressed . 
The interaction of Salmonella with host cells results in profuse membrane ruﬄing , actin rearrangement , and subsequent bacterial uptake . 
Treatment with cytochalasin D ( CCD ) , a speciﬁc actin rearrangement inhibitor , destroys the actin cytoskeleton networks and signiﬁcantly inhibits the invasion of wild type Salmonella . 
Therefore , it is likely that the invasion of Salmonella into host cells requires actin rearrangement , and presenilin 1 may affect actin cytoskeletal networks through its known binding partners , such as bcatenin and ﬁlamin-A [ 9,15 ] . 
Presenilin is known to bind b-catenin on residues 331 -- 351 and affect its stability , which leads to the formation of an adherent junction directly through E-cadherin and through indirect association with actin-associated cytoskeletal proteins [ 8 ] . 
Presenilin 1 and 2 are also known to bind ﬁlamin-A on their loop regions and affect actin polymerization [ 2,4,16 ] . 
Actin-binding protein ( ABP-280 , Filamin A ) is a dimeric actin cross-linking phosphoprotein found in the peripheral cytoplasm and known to regulate the formation of actin stress ﬁbers and adhesive contacts , and bind to other regulators of the cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . 
Interestingly , when we analyzed the levels of b-catenin and ﬁlamin-A in four different presenilin 1/2 expressing MEFs , the levels of ﬁlamin-A were inversely correlated with the levels of presenilin 1 whereas those of b-catenin were not dramatically changed . 
We hypothesized that the decreased levels of ﬁlamin-A in presenilin 1 - and 1 / 2-deﬁcient MEFs may have resulted from either transcriptional regulation or decreased protein stability . 
Evidence supporting the latter was gathered after RT-PCR analysis . 
Extremely low levels of ﬁlamin-A in presenilin 1 - and 1/2-de ﬁcient cells are of great interest , since it has been recently reported that SsH2 and SseI in Salmonella were colocalized with the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton and interacted with ﬁlamin-A , based on the results of a yeast two-hybrid assay [ 3 ] . 
Therefore , the low invasion and replication of Salmonella in presenilin 1/2 deﬁcient cells may be explained by the lack of ﬁlamin-A in these cells . 
We compared ﬁlamin-A-deﬁcient melanoma cells ( M2 ) and ﬁlamin-A-replete cells ( A7 ) in order to address the functional role of ﬁlamin-A in the invasion and rep-lication of Salmonella . 
In contrast to what we expected , there were no signiﬁcant differences between these cells , suggesting that low levels of ﬁlamin-A alone are not the reason for low invasion and replication of Salmonella in presenilin 1/2 deﬁcient cells . 
However , we can not rule out the possibility that different cell types may lead to different outcomes , as the invasion rate in melanoma cells was much lower than MEFs and intestinal epithelial cells we studied . 
Different cells can have varying levels of Filamin-A interaction proteins , including presenilins , TNF receptor , caveolin-1 , Migﬁlin , SEC-1 , and dopamine receptor , which may in turn affect the invasion of Salmonella in melanoma cells [ 5,7,13,14 ] . 
Further experiments , employing siRNA , for example , will be necessary to assess the exact role of ﬁlamin-A in the invasion and replication of Salmonella in preseni-lin-expressing MEFs . 
Presenilin 1 is involved in Notch and Wnt signaling pathways . 
Notch belongs to a family of large type I integral membrane receptors involved in cell fate and proliferation . 
In this report , we showed that Salmonella infection blocked the Notch-related signaling pathway but not the Wnt-related signaling pathway in PS 1/2 + / + cell lines . 
Interestingly , we found that both Hes-1 and TOPFLASH luciferase reporter activities in PS f1/2 / cell lines were very low . 
Further experiments will be required to assess the exact mechanism on how presenilin-related changes , including the Notch signaling pathway , affect the invasion and replication of Salmonella in hostcells .
