Frequent recombination and low level of clonality within Salmonella enterica subspecies I
Salmonella has been assigned to more than 2400 different serovars , based on a serotyping scheme that accounts for the differences in antigenic properties of the LPS ( O antigen ) and the ﬂagellin ( H antigen ) ( Popoff , 2001 ) . 
These serovars were originally designated by Latin binomial species names , but , because of their close relatedness , the species names were subsequently retained as the serovar names of the single Salmonella species known as Salmonella enterica ( Le Minor & Popoff , 1987 ; Brenner et al. , 2000 ) . 
For example , the name Salmonella typhi refers to S. enterica serovar Typhi , or simply Typhi ( the latter convention is used in this paper ) . 
Based on DNA hybridization and biotyping studies , the Salmonella serovars have been classiﬁed into seven subspecies : I , II , IIIa , IIIb , IV , V and VI ( Crosa et al. , 1973 ; Le Minor et al. , 1986 ) . 
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis ( MLEE ) has deﬁned an eighth group , designated subspecies VII , which consists of ﬁve isolates of two serovars that were initially allocated to subspecies IV on the basis of biochemical characteristics ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) . 
Most subspecies of S. enterica are not commonly associated with disease , and they may behave like commensals in coldblooded animals ( Baumler et al. , 1998 ) . 
However , subspecies I strains cause intestinal infections in warm-blooded animals , and are responsible for 99 % of Salmonella-related infections in humans ( Selander et al. , 1996 ; Popoff , 2001 ) . 
The widely prevalent serovar Typhimurium causes gastro-enteritis in humans , but mainly asymptomatic chronic infection in chickens . 
A number of serovars have a restricted host range ; for example , Typhi exclusively infects humans , causing typhoid fever . 
MLEE has been used extensively to study the extent of genetic diversity within S. enterica natural populations . 
The technique has shown that many serovars vary genetically , and are represented by multiple electrophoretic types ( ETs ) ( Beltran et al. , 1988 , 1991 ; Reeves et al. , 1989 ; Selander et al. , 1990a , b ) . 
Some serovars are genotypically heterogeneous ; for example , Derby and Newport ( Beltran et al. , 1988 ) include divergent isolates , with ETs clustered distantly in MLEE trees , while other serovars can be conﬁned within a single cluster of closely related ETs , in which each serovar has a predominant widely distributed ET ( Beltran et al. , 1988 , 1991 ; Reeves et al. , 1989 ; Selander et al. , 1990a , b ) . 
From large-scale MLEE studies , three reference collections have been established by Selander 's group : Salmonella reference collection A ( SARA ) , which consists of 72 strains of serovar Typhimurium and its closely related serovars ( Beltran et al. , 1991 ) ; Salmonella reference collection B ( SARB ) , which consists of 72 strains of 37 subspecies I serovars ( Boyd et al. , 1993 ) ; and Salmonella reference collection C ( SARC ) , which consists of 16 strains representing the eight subspecies ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) . 
Based on MLEE data , the population structure of S. enterica is considered to be clonal , with strong linkage disequili ¬

A low recombination rate has also been demonstrated by the sequence data of six housekeeping genes from the 16 SARC strains . 
Gene trees for the six housekeeping genes are largely congruent ( Nelson et al. , 1991 , 1997 ; Nelson & Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 1994 ; Selander et al. , 1996 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) . 
These ﬁndings led to the conclusion that S. enterica has one of the highest levels of clonality among bacterial species . 
In this study , we sequenced four genes from a selected number of SARB strains in order to determine the genetic relationships of strains belonging to subspecies I , looking in particular for the existence of a serovar closely related to Typhi . 
Instead , we found that recombination is frequent in subspecies I , revealing a low level of clonality within the subspecies , and we were unable to resolve the relationships of most of the isolates studied . 
METHODS
Bacterial isolates . 
Fifteen SARB strains were chosen ( Table 1 ) . 
The strains were obtained from the Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre ( SGSC ) , University of Calgary , Canada . 
For convenience , the strain names designated by Boyd et al. ( 1993 ) have been used instead of the SARB numbers . 
SARB contains two Typhi strains , Tp1 and Tp2 ; Tp2 alone was selected for this study , since Tp1 is identical to genome sequence strain CT18 , based on multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) by Kidgell et al. ( 2002 ) . 
We further conﬁrmed the identity of Tp2 by sequencing three MLST genes ( hemD , hisD and thrA ) , which were shown to vary among the Typhi isolates studied by Kidgell et al. ( 2002 ) . 
The other SARB strains were selected because they have the least number of allelic differences to Tp2 , according to MLEE data ( Boyd et al. , 1993 ) , or because they cause enteric fever in humans.The identity of all other strains used in this study was con-ﬁrmed by PCR serogrouping ( Luk et al. , 1993 ; Hoorfar et al. , 1999 ) , targeting the O-antigen gene clusters . 
Strain Pc4 was puriﬁed from the original stock , which was contaminated with other S. enterica strains . 
Chromosomal DNA was prepared using the phenol/chloroform precipitation method , as described by Bastin et al. ( 1991 ) . 
Gene fragments and primer sequences . 
Four genes were selected on the basis that they are unlikely to be under selection pressure . 
The genes used were : mglA ( galactoside transport ATP-binding protein MglA ) , proV ( glycine betaine L-proline transport ATP-binding protein ) , speC ( ornithine decarboxylase ) and torC ( cytochrome-c-type protein ) ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
These genes are functional in Typhimurium LT2 , but they are pseudogenes in Typhi CT18 . 
The primer pairs used in this study were designed based on the Typhi CT18 genome sequence ( Table 2 ) , and synthesized commercially ( Sigma ) . 
The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database ( accession nos DQ285482 -- DQ285541 ) . 
PCR assay and DNA sequencing . 
Each PCR reaction included 2 ? 
5 ml DNA template ( approx . 
20 ng ) , 0 ? 
5 ml ( 30 pmol ml ) of each 21 forward and reverse primer , 0 ? 
5 ml 10 mM dNTPs , 5 ml 106 PCR buffer ( 500 mM KCl , 100 mM Tris/HCl , pH 9 ? 
0 , 1 % Triton X-100 and 15 mM MgCl2 ) , 0 ? 
25 ml ( 1 ? 
25 U ) Taq polymerase ( Promega ) , and MilliQ water to a total volume of 50 ml . 
PCR cycles were performed in a Hybaid PCR Sprint Thermocycler ( Hybaid ) : initial DNA denaturation for 2 min at 94 uC , followed by DNA denaturation for 15 s at 94 uC , primer annealing for 30 s at 50 uC , and polymerization for 90 s at 72 uC for 35 cycles , with a ﬁnal extension of 5 min at 72 uC . 
PCR products were veriﬁed on ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels , before puriﬁcation using sodium acetate/etha-nol precipitation . 
The PCR sequencing reactions contained BigDye , and were done as recommended by the manufacturer ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
We sequenced both forward and reverse directions . 
Unincorporated dye terminators were removed by ethanol precipitation . 
The reaction products were separated and detected by gel electrophoresis , using the Automated DNA Sequence Analyser ABI377 or ABI3730 ( Applied Biosystems ) at the sequencing facility of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences , University of New South Wales , Australia . 
Bioinformatic analysis . 
The CONSED version 8.0 ( Gordon et al. , 1998 ) program package , accessed through the Australian National Genomic Information Service , was used for sequence editing . 
PILEUP 
* According to the Typhi CT18 genome ( accession no . 
NC_003198 ) . 
DRelative to the ﬁrst base of the initiation codon . 
from the Genetics Computer Group package ( Dolz , 1994 ) , and MULTICOMP ( Reeves et al. , 1994 ) , were used for multiple sequence alignment and comparison . 
PHYLIP ( Felsenstein , 1989 ) was used to generate phylogenetic trees and bootstrap values . 
SPLITTREE version 3.2 ( Bandelt & Dress , 1992 ) was used to create network structures using the distance method . 
Overall compatibility of informative sites was measured by using the RETICULATE program ( Jakobsen & Easteal , 1996 ) , which gives a measure of phylogenetic concordance between two sites , with values ranging from 0 % ( fully incompatible ) to 100 % ( fully compatible ) ; this method was used to obtain a measure of recombination within and between loci , and for comparison with other datasets . 
Maximum-likelihood ( ML ) analysis of the congruence of gene trees , as described by Feil et al. ( 2000 , 2001 ) , was done using PAUP version 4.0 beta ( Swofford , 1998 ) , with the parameters of the HKY85 model of DNA substitutions , estimation of the transition / transversion ( Ti/Tv ) ratio , and a parameter , assuming gamma distribution . 
ML generates scores for comparison of one gene tree against another based on the 99th percentile of the distribution of scores for 200 trees from random topology . 
Two gene trees are considered to be signiﬁcantly congruent if the difference between the likelihood scores of the trees of the two genes ( D2lnL ) is lower than that of any of the 200 random trees , since the second gene tree should be of better ﬁt to the data from the ﬁrst gene than the 200 random trees ( Feil et al. , 2000 , 2001 ) . 
Calculation of the linkage disequilibrium index ( IA ) ( Maynard Smith et al. , 1993 ) from MLEE data was done using an in-house program , MLEECOMP . 
RESULTS
Sequence variation in the four genes
The 15 SARB strains were sequenced for the four genes mglA , proV , speC and torC . 
The total length of sequences obtained was 2985 bp , with 743 , 818 , 820 and 604 bp for mglA , proV , speC and torC , respectively . 
The mean pairwise percentage difference for all genes and strains was 1 ? 
06 ( Table 3 ) . 
A total of 133 sites were polymorphic ( sites at which more than one type of nucleotide exists ) , but only 66 were parsimony informative ( at least two types of nucleo-tides at the site , each represented in at least two of the sequences ) , with 19 , 12 , 24 and 11 sites for mglA , proV , speC and torC , respectively . 
Sequence data of two genes , mutS and mdh , available from the Brown et al. ( 2003 ) study for the same SARB strains used in this study , were included for comparison ( Table 3 ) and subsequent analyses . 
Comparison of Typhi Tp2 with the two genome sequence strains CT18 ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) and Ty2 ( Deng et al. , 2003 ) revealed that Tp2 was identical to Ty2 in all four genes sequenced , but differed from CT18 by one base in torC . 
While most SARB strains have functionally intact sequences , four cases of gene inactivation were observed . 
Two strains , Pc2 and Pc4 , had the same deletion as the Typhi strain , i.e. deletion of a CG repeat in mglA . 
The changes in Pc2 and Pc4 must be independent , as their sequences are very different from each other . 
Strain Pc2 also had a C-to-T substitution , forming a stop codon in torC . 
Strain Pa1 had a C-to-T substitution , leading to a stop codon in mglA . 
The sequence alignment for informative sites is shown in Fig. 1 . 
It is clear that none of the strains is consistently similar in all six genes , suggesting the presence of intergenic recombination . 
Only two pairs of strains , Pn1 and Mo1 , and Sw1 and Pc4 , shared similarity in two or more genes . 
Pn1 and Mo1 shared similarity over the entire sequence in three genes ( proV , torC and mdh ) , but only parts of the sequences in two other genes ( speC and mutS ) . 
Sw1 and Pc4 had almost identical sequences in two genes ( proV and mdh ) , but only some segments similar in three other genes ( mglA , speC and mutS ) . 
Phylogenetic relationships
Evolutionary trees were constructed by the neighbourjoining ( NJ ) method for each of the six genes , and also for the concatenated sequences of all six genes ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The individual gene trees did not resemble one another in their topology , and inconsistent clustering of strains was observed . 
However , there were three cases where strains were grouped closely together in two or more genes : In1 with Np8 in mglA and torC , Pn1 and Mo1 in torC and mdh , and Mo1 and Pc4 in proV , mdh and mutS . 
The groupings of Pn1 , Mo1 and Pc4 were also apparent in the combined tree , while In1 and Np8 appeared to be on separate clusters . 
Most of the branching orders were poorly supported statistically , since bootstrap values , including those for the combined six-gene tree , were low . 
We believe that this is due to conﬂicting signals resulting from recombination , which will be discussed later , and not because of low phylogenetic signal in our data . 
The combined six-gene tree was then compared with an MLEE tree using data from Boyd et al. ( 1993 ) , which was reconstructed to include only the strains used in this study . 
Except for three strains , Sw1 , Pn1 and Pc4 , which broadly fell within the same cluster , other strains were inconsistently clustered in the two trees . 
Split decomposition ( Bandelt & Dress , 1992 ) was then used to visualize the relationship of the strains . 
The method displays conﬂicting phylogenetic signals resulting from recombination as network structures . 
As shown in Fig. 2 , using concatenated six-gene sequences , the relationships of ﬁve strains , Mo1 , Pc4 , Pn1 , Sw1 and Cs6 , were resolved with network structures . 
However , other strains showed a star phylogeny radiating from the same central point . 
This suggests that recombination is extensive , and that the strain relationships are not well represented by a splits graph . 
Congruence analysis
To establish the degree of incongruence among the six gene trees , ML analysis ( Feil et al. , 2000 , 2001 ) was carried out , and the results are summarized in Table 4 . 
None of the six gene trees was congruent to all the other gene trees . 
The gene trees with the largest number of congruencies were those of mdh and mutS , which were congruent to three other gene trees . 
proV and torC trees were congruent to two other gene trees , while the speC tree was congruent to one other gene tree . 
The mglA tree was not congruent to any of the other gene trees . 
Overall , only 37 % of the gene-tree comparisons were congruent among the SARB strains . 
To compare between-subspecies data , we also analysed the six housekeeping-gene trees ( aceK , gapA , icd , mdh , putP and gnd ) of SARC strains sequenced by Selander 's group ( Nelson et al. , 1991 , 1997 ; Nelson & Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 
1994 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) ; all the gene trees were congruent to each other ( data not shown ) . 
Compatibility analysis
We further assessed the level of recombination in S. enterica subspecies I by compatibility analysis of the six genes using the program RETICULATE developed by Jakobsen & Eastal ( 1996 ) . 
We calculated compatibility values both within a gene , and between genes ( Fig. 3 ) . 
mglA had the lowest within-locus compatibility , at 52 % , followed by proV ( 53 % ) , mutS ( 65 % ) , torC ( 67 % ) , mdh ( 73 % ) and speC ( 78 % ) , while for between-loci comparison , torC and speC , both at 53 % , were the most compatible , followed by mdh ( 51 % ) , mutS ( 50 % ) , proV ( 47 % ) and mglA ( 40 % ) . 
We compared the within-subspecies-I values from this study with those between S. enterica subspecies calculated using data of the six housekeeping genes aceK , gapA , icd , mdh , putP and gnd from the 16 SARC strains sequenced by Selander 's group ( Nelson et al. , 1991 , 1997 ; Nelson & Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 1994 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , the compatibility values were much higher for between subspecies than within subspecies I . 
We also compared these values with those of the closely related species Escherichia coli , using data from Reid et al. ( 2000 ) for seven housekeeping genes from 14 strains representing common clones of pathogenic E. coli . 
The S. enterica subspecies I values were lower than those for E. coli ( Fig. 3 ) . 
DISCUSSION
Recombination and clonality within S. enterica subspecies I
This study examined six genes from 15 SARB strains of subspecies I , and found that recombination is frequent . 
ML analysis showed incongruence between the six gene trees studied . 
The incongruence observed could be a result of low sequence variation , but this is less likely , since ML analysis is relatively insensitive to sequence variation , and has been applied to other species with a comparable low level of variation ( Feil et al. , 2001 ) . 
Compatibility analysis was consistent with ML analysis , showing that recombination occurs frequently within S. enterica subspecies I. Altogether , the results suggest that the level of clonality within subspecies I is low . 
It is apparent from our analysis that there are different levels of clonality within S. enterica subspecies . 
Comparison of our data with those from the SARC set , which represents the eight different subspecies , by both ML and compatibility analyses , showed that recombination occurs far more frequently within S. enterica subspecies I than between S. enterica subspecies . 
This situation is rather similar to the case of Rhizobium melitoti ; there are two major divisions of the species , and recombination is rare between the divisions , but common within the divisions ( Maynard Smith et al. , 1993 ) . 
The level of recombination in S. enterica subspecies I can be compared with that in other species . 
By compatibility analysis , we showed that the frequency of recombination in subspecies I was higher than in E. coli . 
The ML analysis allowed comparisons with a number of species to which the method has been applied ( Feil et al. , 2000 , 2001 ) . 
The percentages of gene-tree comparisons which are congruent are 88 , 75 , 55 and 7 % for E. coli ( Feil et al. , 2000 ) , Haemo-philus inﬂuenzae ( Feil et al. , 2000 ) , Staphylococcus aureus ( Feil et al. , 2001 ) and Neisseria meningitidis ( Feil et al. , 2000 ) , respectively . 
In our study , 37 % of the comparisons were congruent among the SARB strains ( Table 4 ) . 
Therefore , the level of clonality of subspecies I is at the lower end of the spectrum , in comparison with E. coli , H. inﬂuenzae , S. aureus and N. meningitidis . 
It is interesting to note that Brown et al. ( 2003 ) recently reported that mutS , a gene involved in mismatch repair and a strong mutator , undergoes frequent recombination in SARB strains , in comparison with SARC strains . 
That study used mdh for comparison , and attributed incongruence of the two gene trees to recombination in mutS . 
Using two genes only , one can not determine which gene has undergone recombination ; mdh was regarded as ` nonrecombinant ' , on the assumption that it does not undergo recombination in the ` highly clonal ' species S. enterica . 
However , a comparison of the six gene trees shows that mdh undergoes frequent recombination , as does mutS . 
Interestingly , despite the potential mutator properties of mutS , the mutS tree is not the most incongruent to the other gene trees . 
It seems that mutS is not more recombinogenic than the other genes , although the implications of this are not yet clear . 
Re-examination of the MLEE data challenges the myth of high clonality at all levels in S. enterica
The results from this study are in sharp contrast to the long-held view that S. enterica has a highly clonal population structure ( Selander et al. , 1991 ; Maynard Smith et al. , 1993 ) . 
In the landmark paper on bacterial population structures by Maynard Smith et al. ( 1993 ) , which , for the ﬁrst time , ranked the recombination rate and , hence , level of clonality of different species , S. enterica was found to be clonal at all levels , from individual serovars to the species as a whole . 
That study used IA to measure the extent of linkage disequilibrium from MLEE data ; IA values for S. enterica were signiﬁcantly greater than zero . 
Our sequence data seem to be in conﬂict with the MLEE data . 
We looked into the MLEE data to seek an explanation . 
We ﬁrst checked whether the discrepancy came from the use of IA as a relative measure of clonality . 
The MLEE data for S. enterica used by Maynard Smith et al. ( 1993 ) were , in fact , for 14 serovars of subspecies I , originating from Selander et al. ( 1990b ) . 
The dataset thus represents subspecies I rather than the whole species . 
We obtained the MLEE data from Boyd et al. ( 1996 ) for 80 ETs that represent all eight subspecies . 
The IA for the 80 ETs is 3 ? 
219 ± 0 ? 
156 , which is almost two and half times greater than that for the subspecies I data of 106 ETs ( 1 ? 
393 ± 0 ? 
135 ) . 
Note that the number of enzymes used was the same in the two datasets , eliminating this effect on the scale of the IA . 
The difference in IA for data between subspecies I and the whole species seems to reﬂect their difference in the level of clonality , and is consistent with our sequence data . 
We further examined the subspecies I MLEE data , reported by Selander et al. ( 1990b ) . 
We tested whether removing closely related ETs , which potentially correspond to clonal complexes , affects the IA . 
We used eBURST ( Feil et al. , 2004 ) to identify closely related ETs , and one ET was selected to represent each cluster . 
When ETs differing by one , two and three loci ( out of 24 ) were removed successively , the IA values dropped progressively from 0 ? 
783 ± 0 ? 
223 to 0 ? 
289 ± 0 ? 
296 , and then to 0 ? 
036 ± 0 ? 
371 . 
Thus , clonal structure disappears when closely related ETs are treated as a unit . 
This change in IA resembles that which occurs in an organism with an epidemic population structure , such as N. meningitidis ( Maynard Smith et al. , 1993 ) . 
This analysis showed that the subspecies I MLEE data gave no support to a strongly clonal population structure for S. enterica . 
The conclusion reached by Maynard Smith et al. ( 1993 ) that S. enterica is clonal at all levels was based on the ﬁnding that IA values for individual serovars are equal to or higher than those for the whole dataset ( see Table 1 of Maynard Smith et al. , 1993 ) . 
Their interpretation assumed that a serovar represents a real genetic group . 
However , a number of serovars , including Paratyphi C and Choleraesuis , used in Maynard Smith et al. ( 1993 ) , are known to be not clustered together with a single origin ( Selander et al. , 1990b ) . 
We suspected that this may have contributed to the high IA values , and examined the data for Paratyphi C and Choleraesuis from Selander et al. ( 1990b ) . 
When we excluded the divergent Pc4 from the Paratyphi C data , the IA value dropped from 4 ? 
157 ± 0 ? 
465 to 20 ? 
444 ± 0 ? 
459 . 
Note that we considered only ETs for our IA calculations . 
Similarly , when we took out the two divergent isolates ( Cs6 and Cs13 ) from the Choleraesuis data , the IA dropped from 1 ? 
432 ± 0 ? 
419 to 20 ? 
313 ± 0 ? 
455 . 
Taking out other isolates only slightly altered the IA . 
Therefore , treating a heterogeneous serovar as a single population artiﬁcially inﬂated the IA , which led to the erroneous interpretation of high clonality at the serovar level , at least for Paratyphi C and Choleraesuis . 
In a series of studies of the SARC set using six housekeeping genes ( Nelson et al. , 1991 ; Nelson & Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 1994 , 1996 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) , it has been shown that in all six gene trees , the two isolates for each of the eight subspecies are consistently grouped , although some recombination is detectable ( Brown et al. , 2002 ) . 
Additionally , in most cases , the branching patterns among the subspecies are also consistent , suggesting only low levels of recombination . 
The sequence data were interpreted as a strong support of the interpretation from the MLEE data that S. enterica is highly clonal , but , as one can now see , wrongly reinforced the erroneous interpretation of the IA analysis from the subspecies I MLEE data . 
Further , the housekeeping gene studies used only two isolates to represent a subspecies , which would not allow identiﬁcation of recombination events within a subspecies . 
Predominance of intra-subspecies recombinational exchange
Based on the level of variation in the six genes , it seems that recombinational exchange occurs only within subspecies I. Among the SARB strains , the level of sequence divergence in the six genes had a maximum of 2 ? 
32 % . 
In contrast , sequence divergence between subspecies based on the data of the six housekeeping genes aceK , gapA , icd , mdh , putP and gnd of the 16 SARC strains ( Nelson et al. , 1991 , 1997 ; Nelson & Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 1994 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) averaged 5 ? 
69 % , with divergence between subspecies I and the other subspecies ranging from 2 ? 
71 to 10 ? 
07 % . 
We further compared levels of divergence of mdh and mutS between SARC and SARB strains sequenced by Brown et al. ( 2003 ) . 
For mdh , the difference between strains of subspecies I and the other subspecies ranged from 2 ? 
31 to 8 ? 
66 % . 
In contrast , mdh from the 15 SARB strains of this study had a mean of 0 ? 
81 % , and a maximum of 1 ? 
56 % . 
Similarly for mutS , no strain within subspecies I had a level of difference equal to or higher than that between subspecies . 
The predominance of intra-subspecies recombination may be the result of a number of factors . 
MutS creates a barrier to the recombination of divergent DNA ( Rayssiguier et al. , 1989 ; Worth et al. , 1994 ; Vulic et al. , 1997 ; Radman et al. , 1999 ; Brown et al. , 2003 ) that may block recombination with other subspecies . 
There could also be a niche barrier ( Matic et al. , 1996 ) . 
S. enterica strains of subspecies I usually share a common niche , warm-blooded animals , while other subspecies are commonly isolated from reptiles . 
It remains to be determined from data for other subspecies whether niche is a signiﬁcant barrier to recombination in S. enterica . 
Relationships of subspecies I isolates
Typhi has been shown to be a homogeneous clone , and has been suggested to have arisen about 50 000 years ago ( Kidgell et al. , 2002 ) . 
Using sequence data , we initially wished to determine which SARB strain is the closest relative of Typhi . 
In the MLEE tree of 72 SARB strains , the two Typhi strains Tp1 and Tp2 are grouped together , and clustered with Derby De1 ( Boyd et al. , 1993 ) . 
However , Typhi Tp2 differs from the other serovars by at least 9 of the 24 enzyme loci studied by Boyd et al. ( 1993 ) , with the least allelic difference to Pc4 , rather than to De1 , of 17 differences . 
The NJ trees ( Fig. 2 ) showed that Typhi was placed inconsistently in the six gene trees . 
Typhi was clustered together with Pb7 in mglA and mutS , and with Pa1 in speC ; these relationships were also reﬂected in the near-identical sequences in mglA and speC ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In proV , Typhi was clustered with De1 , although it had a higher sequence similarity to Pb7 . 
Typhi was not closely clustered with any other strain in torC and mdh . 
Thus there is no clear indication of the closest relative of the Typhi clone in the 15 SARB strains analysed . 
For the 15 SARB strains studied , the only strains that appeared to have a clear relationship were the four more closely related strains Sw1 , Pc4 , Pn1 and Mo1 . 
Both the split tree and the combined six-gene NJ tree showed that the four strains formed one group , in which Sw1 and Pc4 appeared to be more closely related . 
A high level of recombination appears to have eliminated most of the phylogenetic signals from the gene trees . 
This was also evident in the bootstrap values , which were low in most of the interior branches for the combined six-gene NJ tree . 
The MLEE tree of SARB has been widely used to represent the strain phylogeny of these strains ( Pabbaraju et al. , 2000 ; Torpdahl & Ahrens , 2004 ) . 
Although we can only make a comparison of 15 of the 72 strains , no consistency of clustering of strains was observed between the MLEE tree and the combined sequence tree ( Fig. 2 ) , suggesting that the MLEE tree does not necessarily represent the true phylogeny of the strains , and its use for mapping and inferring genetic events may not be warranted . 
Concluding comments
Our study has contributed to a better understanding of the population structure of S. enterica . 
Previous sequence studies , using strains of different subspecies ( Selander et al. , 1996 ) , have shown largely congruent gene trees , leading to the general conclusion that S. enterica is highly clonal . 
In contrast , using SARB strains of subspecies I , this study suggests that recombination has occurred at a frequency sufﬁciently high to have eliminated many of the phylogenetic signals . 
Statistical analyses using compatibility , split decomposition and ML provide further evidence that recombination is frequent in S. enterica subspecies I . 
These ﬁndings reveal that the clonality of S. enterica varies within the species . 
Further studies are required to quantify recombination and mutation parameters in subspecies I , and to ascertain these parameters in the other subspecies . 
Our observation of a high level of recombination within subspecies I indicates the need for further work on the evolution of S. enterica clones . 
Nearly 1500 serovars in subspecies I have been reported , comprising 60 % of known S. enterica serovars ( Popoff , 2001 ) . 
Only 2 % of subspecies I serovars have been studied at population genetic level , largely by MLEE , which has provided a limited picture of evolutionary origins of the specialized ( e.g. host-adapted ) clones , and the diversity of the subspecies . 
The ﬁndings of frequent recombination from this study have now blurred that picture , since the MLEE relationships between more distantly related ETs can no longer be considered reliable . 
There is a great need to determine the relationships at sequence level , using multilocus sequence data , of clones encompassing the whole subspecies , in addition to those frequently encountered in human and domestic animal infections , and this will provide a better framework within which to study the evolution of pathogenicity and host adaptation .
