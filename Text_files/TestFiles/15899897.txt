Posttranslational regulation of protein function by acetylation is present throughout nature . 
Regulation of protein function by Sir2 protein ( sirtuin ) deacetylases is conserved in all domains of life . 
In the prokaryote Sal-monella enterica , the metabolic enzyme acetyl-coen-zyme A synthetase ( Acs ) is regulated by a Sir2-depend-ent protein acetylation/deacetylation system ( SDPADS ) . 
The recent identification of the acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the acetylation of Acs defined the SDPADS in prokaryotes . 
This report identifies one res-idue in Acs , Leu-641 , which is critical for the acetylation of Acs by the protein acetyltransferase enzyme . 
In vivo and in vitro evidence shows that mutations at Leu-641 prevent the acetylation of Acs by protein acetyltransferase , maintain the Acs enzyme in its active state , and bypass the need for sirtuin deacetylase activity during growth on acetate . 
Sir2 proteins ( sirtuins ) are biologically conserved NAD - de-pendent protein deacetylases involved in the posttranslational modification of a wide variety of protein substrates including histones ( 1 -- 5 ) , tumor suppressor protein p53 ( 6 , 7 ) , and microtubule protein - tubulin ( 8 ) . 
Evidence that archaeal sirtuins regulate gene expression by modulating the acetylation state of the chromatin protein Alba has been reported ( 9 , 10 ) . 
The interactions of Sir2 family members with their protein substrates have been characterized through structural work ( 11 -- 16 ) , providing insights into the mechanisms of substrate binding and deacetylation chemistry . 
Studies of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases ( GNATs ) identified a superfamily of protein acetyltransferases involved in the acetylation of Sir2 protein targets ( 17 -- 21 ) . 
Members of the GNAT superfamily of proteins are widely distributed throughout all domains of life , yet show strikingly limited sequence similarity at the primary amino acid level ( 21 ) . 
Factors determining the specificity of these systems in regard to their substrates and molecular partners are only now beginning to emerge ( 14 , 17 ) .

A ( Ac-CoA ) synthetase ( Acs 1 ; EC 6.2.1.1 ) as a substrate of the sirtuin-dependent protein acetylation/deacetylation system ( SDPADS ) ( 22 ) . 
The role of Acs , an enzyme central to the metabolism of all cells , is to activate acetate to Ac-CoA ( 23 ) . 
The Acs reaction proceeds via an Ac-AMP intermediate ( Fig. 1 ) before yielding Ac-CoA , a high energy metabolite involved in many anabolic and catabolic processes ( 23 ) . 
In Salmonella enterica , Acs activity is posttranslationally regulated via acetylation of residue Lys-609 . 
Acetylation of the latter effectively blocks the conversion of acetate to Ac-AMP ( 22 ) . 
Removal of the acetyl moiety from acetylated Acs protein ( AcsAc ) is catalyzed by the S. enterica Sir2 ortholog encoded by the cobB gene ( 24 ) . 
As reported earlier , sirtuin-dependent deacetylation of AcsAc consumes NAD and restores full activity of the enzyme ( 22 ) . 
We recently showed that the pat ( formerly yfiQ ) gene of S. enterica encodes a member of the GNAT family of acetyltransferase enzymes responsible for the acetylation of Acs ( 25 ) . 
The discovery of the protein acetyltransferase ( Pat ) defined the SDPADS in this bacterium ( Fig. 2 ) ( 25 ) . 
Here we report results from studies aimed at dissecting the molecular interactions between Acs and the S. enterica protein acetyltransferase , Pat . 
Using genetic selections , we identified a specific residue in Acs , Leu-641 , as a critical amino acid for the acetylation of Acs by Pat . 
We propose that changes at this position alter the protein-protein interactions between Acs and Pat . 
Residue Leu-641 is hypothesized to be part of the Patbinding domain of Acs . 
In vitro and in vivo evidence is presented in support of this conclusion . 
This work begins defining the mechanism of protein substrate recognition by the SDPADS of S. enterica .

Genetic Procedures
Phage P22 Transductions -- All transductional crosses were performed as described previously ( 27 ) using phage P22 HT105/1 int-210 ( 28 , 29 ) . 
Transductants were freed of phage as described ( 30 ) . 
Random Mutagenesis of Acs -- Plasmid pACS7 ( acs ) was introduced into the mutagenic Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Red ( Stratagene ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The resulting transformants were resuspended into 5 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and grown over-night at 37 °C with shaking . 
This culture was subcultured 1:100 ( v : v ) into 5 ml of fresh ampicillin-containing LB medium and allowed to continue growth at 37 °C with shaking . 
After the second overnight outgrowth , plasmid was reisolated using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep kit ( Promega ) . 
Isolation of a Plasmid Encoding an Acs Enzyme Insensitive to Acetylation by Pat -- The pool of mutagenized pACS7 plasmid was electroporated ( 31 , 32 ) into S. enterica strain JE6668 ( acs pta cobB ) , which was unable to grow on any concentration of acetate because of the lack of Acs and phosphotransacetylase ( Pta ) functions . 
The cobB mutation ensured that any Acs encoded by the plasmid introduced into the strain would remain acetylated ; hence growth on acetate could only occur if the variant Acs protein could escape acetylation by the Pat enzyme . 
Transformed cells were plated onto NCE minimal agar supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4 , 0.5 mM L-methionine , 100 M L - ( ) - arabinose ( for induction of acs expression ) , ampicillin , and 10 mM acetate as the sole carbon and energy source . 
Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Clones arising on these plates were reisolated on the same solid medium and further characterized . 
The sequence of the acs gene encoded by plasmids that allowed strain JE6668 to grow on low acetate concentrations was determined using BigDyeTM protocols ( ABI PRISM , University of Wiscon-sin-Madison Biotechnology Center ) . 
Construction of Plasmid pACS12 ( AcsL641P ) -- Plasmid pACS10 encoding wild-type Acs protein fused at its C terminus to a chitin-binding domain was used as a template in the PCR-mediated QuikChange ® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . 
We used mutagenic primers 5 - GGTGGAGAAACCGCTCGAAGAGAA-3 and 5 - CTTCTCTTCGAG-CGGTTTCTCCACC-3 to introduce the L641P mutation ( underlined residues identify the mutagenic nucleotide ) . 
PCRs were performed as per the manufacturer 's protocol ; DNA sequencing confirmed the single base substitution . 
The resulting plasmid was named pACS12 , which carried allele acs4 that encoded AcsL641P protein fused to a chitinbinding domain at its C terminus . 
Construction of Plasmid pACS13 ( AcsL641P ) -- Plasmid pACS7 carrying the wild-type acs gene under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter was used as template in the PCR-mediated QuikChange ® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . 
To introduce the L641P mutation , the mutagenic primers used in the construction of plasmid pACS12 were used . 
The reactions were performed as per the manufacturer 's protocol . 
DNA sequencing confirmed the single base substitution . 
The resulting plasmid was named pACS13 , which directed the synthesis of AcsL641P protein in response to arabinose in the medium . 
Construction of Plasmid pACS15 ( AcsL641Q ) and Plasmid pACS16 ( AcsL641A ) -- Plasmid pACS15 and pACS16 were constructed as described for plasmid pACS13 , except that mutagenic primers 5 - GGTG-GAGAAACAGCTCGAAGAGAA-3 and 5 - CTTCTCTTCGAGCTGTT -

Model of posttranslational control of Acs by the SDPADS . 
Acs proteins are acetylated by the S. enterica Pat in an acetyl-CoA-dependent manner . 
These acetylated Acs proteins are inactive for the adenylation of acetate ( left ) . 
CobB , the S. enterica sirtuin deacetylates Acs in a NAD - dependent manner , releasing 2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide . 
Unacetylated Acs is competent for the conversion of acetate to its adenylated intermediate ( acetyl-AMP ) and acetyl coenzyme A ( right ) .

Biochemical Procedures
Purification of AcsL641P Protein -- Acs protein carrying the L641P mutation was obtained by expressing the acs allele carried by plasmid pACS12 . 
The variant protein was purified from S. enterica cobB and cobB genetic backgrounds as described for wild-type Acs ( 22 ) . 
Purification of GST-Pat -- GST-Pat was purified as described ( 25 ) . 
Purified GST-Pat protein was dialyzed against 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer , pH 7.5 , containing 0.1 M KCl and 25 % ( v/v ) glycerol . 
The protein was drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C . 
In Vitro AMP-forming Ac-CoA Synthetase Reactions -- Ac-CoA synthetase activity of Acs was monitored as described ( 22 , 33 , 34 ) . 
Acs-de-pendent synthesis and isolation of radiolabeled Ac-CoA using [ 14C,C-1 ] acetate , ATP , and CoA with thin-layer chromatography were performed as described ( 22 ) , except that 1 g of unacetylated bovine serum albumin was added to each reaction to increase Acs stability . 
Pat-mediated Acetylation of Acs -- Protein acetylation reactions using [ 14C,C-1 ] Ac-CoA were performed as described ( 25 ) . 
Briefly , 10 g of Acs protein was added to 5 g of GST-Pat protein in 0.05 M HEPES buffer , pH 7.5 , containing 20 M [ 14C,C-1 ] Ac-CoA ( specific activity , 47 mCi / mmol ) ( Moravek ) and 200 M Tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine hydrochloride in a final volume of 100 l. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C after which proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichlo-roacetic acid to a final concentration of 5 % ( w : v ) . 
Precipitated proteins were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol and allowed to air-dry . 
Proteins were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) ( 35 ) followed by Coomassie staining ( 36 ) . 
Polyacrylamide gels were dried onto a piece of Whatman ® paper and placed in a sealed film cassette under a CycloneTM Storage Phosphor Screen ( Packard Instruments ) . 
Signal intensity was analyzed after 8 h of exposure using the Cyclone ™ Phosphor Detection System as per the manufacturer 's directions . 
Pat-mediated Inhibition of Ac-CoA Synthetase Activity -- Acs proteins ( Acswt and AcsL641P ) were isolated from S. enterica as described above , except that strain JE7462 ( pat cobB/pTara ) was used as the overexpression host . 
Acs proteins were acetylated by purified Pat protein in the following manner . 
A 150 - l total volume reaction containing 0.05 M HEPES buffer , pH 7.5 , 200 M Tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine , 40 M Ac-CoA , and 10 % glycerol ( v : v ) contained either active or heat-inacti-vated GST-Pat at a concentration of 0.95 M ( 18.5 g ) ; Acs proteins were added to 1.9 M ( 20 g ) . 
Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. GST-Pat was removed from the reactions by 80 l of GST Mag beads ( 50 % slurry ( v/v ) ( Novagen ) ) pre-equilibrated with the acetyltransferase reaction buffer . 
Incubation and removal of the magnetic beads was performed as per the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Reaction superna-tants were filtered through 0.45 - m Spin-X ® centrifuge tube filters ( Costar ) . 
The protein concentration of the filtered reaction was determined and tested for Ac-CoA synthetase activity as described ( 33 , 34 ) ,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The in vitro and in vivo evidence discussed below indicate that residue Leu-641 of Acs is critical for the acetylation of the active site residue Lys-609 by the Pat enzyme . 
Because residue Leu-641 lies close to the site of acetylation in Acs ( Lys-609 ) , we postulate that Leu-641 plays a critical role in the interaction of Acs with Pat . 
The Variant AcsL641P Enzyme Is No Longer Posttranslationally Controlled by the SDPADS -- We used a genetic approach to identify derivatives of Acs that were no longer acetylated by Pat . 
cobB pat strains of S. enterica do not grow at low acetate concentrations ( 10 mM ) , because in the absence of CobB sirtuin deacetylase Acs remains acetylated ( i.e. inactive , Fig. 2 ) ( 37 ) . 
The rationale for the search was centered on the premise that if Pat failed to acetylate Acs in the pat cobB background , Acs would remain active and cells would grow on acetate despite the lack of CobB sirtuin deacetylase . 
To isolate variants of Acs that were no longer acetylated by Pat , we mutagenized plasmid pACS7 acs ( Acswt ) and selected for plasmids that would restore growth of the strain JE6668 ( acs pta cobB ) on minimal medium supplemented with 10 mM acetate as carbon and energy source and L ( ) - arabinose ( 100 M ) as inducer of plasmid-borne acs . 
It was important to inactivate the chromosomal copies of acs and phosphotrans-acetylase ( pta ) to completely block acetate conversion to Ac ¬

CoA ( 37 -- 39 ) and eliminate background growth on acetate ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Sequencing of the acs allele encoded by a plasmid that supported robust growth of strain JE6668 on acetate revealed a single TA to CG transition at nucleotide 1922 . 
This base substitution resulted in a mutant Acs protein with a replacement of a leucyl residue with a prolyl residue at position 641 . 
The L641P mutation was reconstructed using site-directed PCR mutagenesis to confirm the phenotype associated with this mutation . 
Acs protein encoded by the reconstructed plasmid ( pACS13 acs4 ( AcsL641P ) ) restored the ability of strain JE6668 ( acs pta cobB ) to grow on acetate when arabinose was added to the medium to induce the synthesis of AcsL641P ( Fig. 3A , open diamonds versus solid diamonds ) . 
A strain carrying a plasmid encoding wild-type Acs protein failed to grow even when arabinose was included in the medium to induce the synthesis of wild-type Acs protein ( Fig. 3B , lower left panel ) . 
To determine whether the substitution of residue Leu-641 by Pro was specific , we replaced Leu-641 with Gln or Ala ; the presence of the mutations was verified by DNA sequencing . 
Growth analyses involving strains carrying plasmid pACS15 acs5 ( AcsL641Q ) or plasmid pACS16 acs6 ( AcsL641A ) were performed using a strain carrying plasmid pACS13 acs4 ( AcsL641P ) as control . 
Strain JE6668 ( acs pta cobB ) harboring the plasmid pACS15 acs5 ( AcsL641Q ) or pACS16 acs6 ( AcsL641A ) , as well as the strain carrying plasmid pACS13 acs4 ( AcsL641P ) ( data not shown ) , grew on 10 mM acetate , indicating that the effect of a change on Leu-641 was not specific to the side chain of the prolyl residue and emphasizing the importance of the side chain of the leucyl residue at that position . 
Purified AcsL641P Is Active in the Absence of CobB-Sirtuin Deacetylase Activity -- Acswt and AcsL641P Acs enzymes were purified from S. enterica cobB and cobB genetic background to gain insights into the mechanism by which the L641P mutation afforded CobB-independent Acs activity in vivo . 
Specific activities of these proteins were calculated , measuring the formation of [ 14C,C-1 ] Ac-CoA from [ 14C,C-1 ] acetate , Mg ( II ) / ATP , and HS-CoA ( Table II ) . 
As expected , Acswt purified from the sirtuindeficient cobB background was substantially less active than the identical enzyme purified from the sirtuin-proficient cobB background ( 36-fold reduction in activity , Table II ) . 
Incubation of inactive Acswt with CobB sirtuin and NAD restored activity to wild-type levels ( from 0.1 0.01 to 4.2 0.04 mol/min/mg protein ; Table II ) . 
In striking contrast to these results , the AcsL641P enzyme purified from the cobB background was nearly as active as the Acswt enzyme purified from the cobB background ( 3.2 0.09 versus 3.9 0.01 mol / min/mg protein , respectively ) . 
Incubation of CobB and NAD with the AcsL641P enzyme purified from the sirtuin-deficient background did not change the activity of the AcsL641P enzyme . 
In addition , AcsL641P enzyme isolated from the cobB background showed little difference ( 1.5-fold ) in specific activity when compared with the same enzyme purified from the cobB background ( 4.7 versus 3.2 mmol of Ac-CoA min 1 mg 1 ) , indicating that the mutant protein was no longer under SDPADS control . 
These results could be explained by a lack of acetylation of the AcsL641P enzyme by Pat . 
We also considered the unlikely alternative explanation would be that AcsL641P enzyme gained the ability to activate acetate in the presence of acetylated Lys-609 . 
Pat Does Not Acetylate AcsL641P Protein and Does Not Inhibit Its Activity -- To address the possibility that the L641P mutation blocked Acs acetylation by Pat , purified AcsL641P enzyme 14 was incubated with Pat and [ C,C-1 ] Ac-CoA , and the presence of labeled Acs protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging . 
Control experiments showed that Pat efficiently 14 14 transferred the [ C,C-1 ] acetyl moiety of [ C,C-1 ] Ac-CoA to wild-type Acs protein ( Fig. 4 , lanes 1 ) and that heat-inactivated Pat did not ( Fig. 4 , lanes 2 ) . 
In contrast to Acswt , AcsL641P enzyme was not a substrate for Pat under the in vitro conditions tested ( Fig. 4 , lanes 3 ) . 
These results were consistent with the idea that the AcsL641P enzyme was not acetylated by Pat in vivo , allowing the CobB sirtuin deacetylase-deficient strain , JE6668 , to grow on acetate . 
L641P To show that purified Pat did not acetylate Acs at Lys-609 , we monitored Acs activity after incubation with Pat . 
As expected , Pat-mediated inhibition of Acswt activity was observed ( 16-fold reduction ) . 
Strikingly , the activity of the AcsL641P enzyme was not significantly affected ( 10 versus 12 mol of Ac-CoA/min/mg of protein ; Table III ) . 
However , the AcsL641P enzyme activity was about one-third that of the Acswt enzyme , suggesting that the L641P mutation may affect the stability of the enzyme . 
The effect of the L641P mutation on Acs activity or stability has not been further characterized . 
Conclusions -- Results from these studies suggest that the structural contributions of residue Leu-641 of Acs are critical for its interaction with the Pat protein acetyltransferase . 
This conclusion is based on the robust negative effects that changes at position 641 had on the ability of Pat to acetylate Acs , despite drastic changes in the side chain introduced at that position . 
Although the crystal structures of unacetylated and acetylated Acs from S. enterica were solved in the presence of ligands ( 41 ) , the region of Acs that contains residue Lys-609 was disordered in both models , making it difficult to determine the spatial relationship of Leu-641 to Lys-609 . 
Leu-641 is located in - helix 20 ( residues 637 -- 645 ) , the last - helix of the Acs protein ( Fig. 5 ) , which could suggest that this helix represents a possible binding site on Acs for the Pat protein . 
Further studies of Pat-Acs interactions are under way .
