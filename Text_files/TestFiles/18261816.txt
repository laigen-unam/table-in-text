Abstract 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is a significant biofilm-forming pathogen . 
The influence of a 10-fold difference in nutrient laminar flow velocity on the dynamics of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilm formation and protein expression profiles were compared in order to ascertain how flow velocity influenced biofilm structure and function . 
Low-flow ( 0.007 cm s − 1 ) biofilms consisted of diffusely-arranged microcolonies which grew until merging by ∼ 72 h. High-flow ( 0.07 cm s − 1 ) biofilms were significantly thicker ( 36 ± 3 µm ( arithmetic mean ± standard error ; n = 225 ) versus 16 ± 2 µm for low-flow biofilms at 120 h ) and consisted of large bacterial mounds interspersed by water channels . 
Lectin-binding analysis of biofilm exopolymers revealed a significantly higher ( P b 0.05 ) proportion of N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) in low-flow biofilms ( 55.2 % ) , relative to only 1.2 % in high-flow biofilms . 
Alternatively , the proportions of α-L-fucose and N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc2 ) -- N-acetylneuraminic acid ( NeuNAc ) polymer-conjugates were significantly higher ( P b 0.05 ) in high-flow biofilms ( 69.1 % and 29.6 % , respectively ) than low-flow biofilms ( 33.1 % and 11.7 % , respectively ) . 
Despite an apparent flow rate-based physiologic effect on biofilm structure and exopolymer composition , no major shift in whole-cell protein expression patterns was seen between 168 h-old low-flow and high-flow biofilms , and notably did not include any response involving the stress response proteins , DnaK , SodB , and Tpx . 
Proteins involved in degradation and energy metabolism ( PduA , GapA , GpmA , Pgk , and RpiA ) , RNA and protein biosynthesis ( Tsf , TufA , and RpoZ ) , cell processes ( Crr , MalE , and PtsH ) , and adaptation ( GrcA ) , and some hypothetical proteins ( YcbL and YnaF ) became up-regulated in both biofilm systems relative to a 168 h-old planktonic cell control . 
Our results indicate that Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms altered their structure and extracellular glycoconjugate composition in response to flow and this response is suggested to be significant in the survival of this pathogen as biofilms .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis has emerged as one of the most important of all the food-borne pathogens , causing major outbreaks , especially in developed countries over the past 30 years ( Patrick et al. , 2004 ; Guerin et al. , 2006 ) . 
Salmonella Enteritidis results in losses of more than 500 million dollars annually due to associated medical costs of infections in humans , as

well as lost productivity and revenue to the egg and meat industries ( Frenzen et al. , 1999 ; Food and Drug Administration , 2004 ) . 
Biofilm formation by Salmonella Enteritidis has been documented ( Korber et al. , 1997 ; Stepanović et al. , 2003 ; Mangalappalli-Illathu and Korber , 2006 ) and it has been reported by Solano et al. ( 2002 ) that nearly all ( 97 % ) of 204 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates tested from various sources may form biofilms . 
These biofilms may serve as a reservoir of pathogens during the production of food products ( Stepanović et al. , 2003 ) . 
Thus , attachment of Salmonella to food processing surfaces and subsequent development of biofilms may have significant economic and public health consequences . 
In systems dominated by laminar flow , molecular diffusion is the primary mechanism whereby nutrients and wastes are transported int and out of the biofilm matrix ( Bryers , 1987 ; Davey and O'Toole , 2000 ) . 
While there have been recent attempts to generalize the effects of fluid flow velocity on biofilm developmental processes , it should be noted that considerable variability in bio-film formation has been reported for different bacteria grown under various hydrodynamic regimens . 
It has further been hypothesized that cellular automaton models are applicable for describing the development and architecture of microbial bio-films ; the interaction between substrate concentration , substrate gradient , and detachment forces might significantly influence the biofilm structure resulting in a system with overall reduced stress ( Van Loosdrecht et al. , 1997 ; Wimpenny and Colasanti , 1997 ) . 
Although molecular mechanisms mediating cell attachment and biofilm formation in Salmonella spp . 
are not completely understood , it is recognized that various genes and their products are either up-or down-regulated in response to biofilm formation . 
For example , the agfD promoter , encoding a putative response regulator of thin aggregative fimbriae expression , is involved in biofilm formation by Salmonella Typhimurium ( Römling et al. , 2000 ; Gerstel and Römling , 2001 ; Stepanović et al. , 2003 ) . 
Information on the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of agfD , and therefore biofilm formation , is limited even though multicellular behavior has been shown to be positively regulated at the onset of the stationary phase by agfD ( Römling et al. , 1998 , 2000 ; Gerstel and Römling , 2001 ) . 
Two genetic operons , namely bcsABZC and bcsEFG , are also required for the biosynthesis of cellulose which is a constituent of Salmonella Enteritidis EPS , suggesting that cellulose production is a factor in the survival and proliferation of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms associated with surface environments ( Solano et al. , 2002 ) . 
It has also been reported in Escherichia coli that 22 % of genes were up-regulated in the biofilm state , and 16 % were down-regulated ( Prigent-Combaret et al. , 1999 ) . 
Evidence exists that up - and down-regulation of a number of genes occur in surface colonizing cells following initial interaction with the substratum ( Donlan , 2002 ) . 
Notably , despite hypotheses that the biofilm contains zones where conditions would be presumed to be stressful ( e.g. , cells in the stationary phase ) , no work has demonstrated large-scale expression of stress genes . 
The influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the formation and maintenance of biofilms formed by Salmonella spp . 
is not well understood ( Stepanović et al. , 2003 ) , and could be significant for the development of resistant phenotypes responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents on food processing surfaces . 
In this study we used nutrient flow velocity as a tool to simulate the effect of flow conditions that occur in routine food processing environments , on : ( i ) development of biofilm architecture , ( ii ) biofilm EPS composition , and ( iii ) protein expression profiles of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Media and chemicals
Tryptic Soy Agar ( TSA ) , Standard Plate Count Agar ( SPCA ) , and Trypticase Soy Broth ( TSB ) were purchased from BBL 
( Becton Dickinson , Cockeysville , MD ) ; magnesium chloride ( MgCl2 ) , phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 3 - [ ( 3-cho-lamidopropyl ) - dimethylammonio ] -1 - propanesulfonate ( CHAPS ) , DNase , RNase A , fluorescein sodium salt , bromo-phenol blue , DL-dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) ; sodium chloride was from EM Science ( Gibbstown , NJ ) ; EDTA was from J. T. Baker Chemical Co. ( Philipsburg , NJ ) ; glycerol , sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) , tris base , and urea were purchased from Life Technologies ( Grand Island , NY ) ; Bac-Light ™ Live/Dead Viability Probe was purchased from Invitrogen Canada Inc. ( Burlington , ON , Canada ) ; and immobilized pH gradient ( IPG ) buffer ( pH 4.0 to 7.0 ) , Immobiline DryStrip gels and PlusOne ™ Protein Silver Staining Kit were purchased from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Inc. ( Baie d'Urfé , QC , Canada ) . 
The plant lectins Ulex europaeus and Triticum vulgaris conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) , respectively , were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. , as was the lectin Glycine max . 
The cyanine dye ( CY5 ) labeling for G. max was performed using a commercial labeling kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Research Organics , Cleveland , OH ) . 
2.2. Bacteria and culture conditions
Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 4931 was cultured from frozen stock on TSA plates overnight at 37 °C . 
Cells in the mid-log phase of growth were obtained by transferring a loopful of colony material from TSA plates to 50 ml of 10 % [ wt/vol ] TSB in an Erlenmeyer flask and incubating on a gyratory shaker ( 150 ± 5 rpm ) held at room temperature ( RT ; 21 ± 2 °C ) as batch culture for approximately 12 h . 
These cells , which were previously determined to be in the mid-log phase of growth , were used to inoculate flow cells . 
Planktonic cells for control experiments were grown in continuous culture in an Erlenmeyer flask held on a gyratory shaker ( 150 ± 5 rpm ) and incubated at RT for 168 h ; the total culture volume was set at 175 ml . 
Nutrient medium ( 10 % [ wt/vol ] TSB ) was added and removed continuously at the rate of 25 ml h − 1 resulting in a dilution rate of 0.14 h − 1 . 
The medium was pumped into and out of the Erlenmeyer flask via silicone tubing using two Watson -- Marlow peristaltic pumps ( Model 202U ; Watson -- Marlow , Cornwall , UK ) , with each one set to control the input of the medium to the flask and removal of the effluent to a waste reservoir . 
2.3. Flow cells, inoculation, and flow velocity
Multi-channel flow cells were constructed using 5 mm thick sheets of polycarbonate plastic into which were milled channels that were covered with glass coverslips , on which the biofilms were analyzed ( Korber et al. , 1994 ) . 
Due to optical limitations , flow cells for use in dark-field microscopy were constructed entirely out of glass slides and coverslips . 
Flow cell channels were sterilized by flushing with 5.25 % [ wt/vol ] sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min . 
Reservoirs of sterile nutrient medium ( 10 % [ wt/vol ] TSB ) were connected via silicone tubing to the flow cell channels and subsequently connected to th effluent reservoir . 
The medium was pumped through flow cells using a Watson -- Marlow peristaltic pump . 
Each flow cell channel was separately inoculated with 0.5 ml mid-log phase Salmonella Enteritidis cells , prepared as outlined above , concentrated or diluted to an optical density equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard ( 1.5 × 108 cfu ml − 1 ) . 
The bulk flow rates of 2.5 ml h − 1 and 25 ml h − 1 resulted in laminar flow velocities of 0.007 cm s − 1 and 0.07 cm s − 1 , respectively . 
Biofilms grown at nutrient laminar flow velocities of 0.007 cm s − 1 and 0.07 cm s − 1 will hereafter known as low-flow and high-flow biofilms , respectively . 
Corresponding Reynolds numbers ( Re ) for low-flow and high-flow conditions were determined to be 0.237 and 2.37 , respectively . 
2.4. Steady-state growth
Steady-state growth of biofilms grown on glass/polycarbo-nate and silicone surfaces was determined by assessing the pattern of dispersion of cells and the thicknesses of the biofilms ( see below ) . 
Analysis of cell shedding or dispersion ( n = 4 ) was used to monitor the extent of cell release from the glass/polycarbonate surfaces and the silicone tubing surfaces . 
Effluent from inoculated silicone tubing ( no flow cell ) was used to quantify cell shedding from the silicone surfaces ; whereas , effluent from an inoculated flow cell with a short glass outlet ( ∼ 1 cm ) was used to determine cell shedding from the flow cell . 
The effluent from biofilms grown on 10 % [ wt/vol ] TSB as nutrient medium at low-laminar and high-laminar flow velocities in either the channels of flow cells or on the inner surface of silicone tubing was collected aseptically , and enumerated at 12 h intervals . 
The effluent was serially diluted and plated on SPCA over a 168 h period in order to define the point at which the biofilms grown on the two different substrates reached a `` pseudo-steady state '' condition . 
Colonies were enumerated after overnight growth at 37 °C and the pattern of cell release versus time was used to determine when the biofilms reached the `` pseudo-steady state '' condition . 
2.5. Dark-field microscopy
A Zeiss model III RS microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a 10 × dark-field ( 0.22 numerical aperture ) objective lens and a cooled CCD camera ( Sensys model 1401E ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) controlled by PC-based RS Image version 1.7.3 software ( Roper Scientific Inc. , Trenton , NJ ) was used to collect images for low-power montage reconstruction . 
Montages of approximately 1 × 106 µm2 in total area were assembled using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 software ( Adobe Systems Inc. , Mountain View , CA ) . 
2.6. Biofilm thickness measurements
The thickness of biofilms was measured in µm using a computer controlled , motorized z-axis stepper motor and manual focusing using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope ( Nikon Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) ( Korber et al. , 1994 ) . 
Fifteen random fields were assessed for each biofilm with five separate thickness values obtained per field ( n = 75 ) . 
These values were averaged ( i.e. , arithmetic mean ) to obtain the thickness of each biofilm . 
The thickness measurements at each time interval ( 24 h ) are the arithmetic mean of 225 thickness measurements made at random locations from three biofilms replicated experimentally . 
2.7 . 
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy ( CLSM ) and digital image analyses 
Optical thin sections ( OTSs ) were acquired for semiquantitatively estimating biofilm biomass and viability of cells using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 Lasersharp fluorescence scanning confocal laser system ( Bio-Rad Microscience , Hemel Hempstead , UK now Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH , Jena , Germany ) mounted on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope . 
Optical thin sections ( each a total of 8067 µm2 ) from 5 biofilm depths ( 0 , 3.7 , 7.4 , 11.1 , and 14.8 µm , where 0 µm represents the biofilm -- substratum interface ) were collected for each of 15 biofilm sampling locations from three independently replicated experiments . 
Fluorescein was used for negative staining of biofilms and subsequent CLSM biomass estimation ( Caldwell et al. , 1992 ) , with percentage biomass ( the reported parameter ) representing the area covered by biofilm material at each section depth relative to the total field area . 
In order to determine bacterial viability as influenced by the flow stress , biofilms were stained with the BacLight ™ Live/Dead Viability Probe and assayed using dual-channel CLSM , and their fluorescence response was quantified ( n = 15 ) as follows ( Korber et al. , 1996 , 2002 ; Webb et al. , 2003 ) . 
Single-channel or dual-channel images were acquired in either the xy or vertical xz plane of analysis . 
The analyses of images for biofilm biomass and viability estimations were performed using MacIntosh ™ - based NIH Image version 1.63 f software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . 
The application of CLSM coupled with fluor-conjugated lectins to semi-quantitatively probe the EPS components within biofilm communities is well documented ( Neu and Lawrence , 1999 ; Neu et al. , 2001 ) . 
A preliminary survey examining eight different fluor -- lectin conjugates showed that G. max -- CY5 , T. vulgaris -- TRITC , and U. europaeus -- FITC had the most extensive binding to glycoconjugate residues of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms . 
The fluor-conjugated lectins G. max -- CY5 , T. vulgaris -- TRITC , and U. europaeus -- FITC were subsequently used in combination ( triple lectin labeling ) for in situ analyses of EPS composition , as described previously ( Neu et al. , 2001 ) . 
N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) residues in the EPS were detected by the binding of G. max-CY5 conjugate , α-L-fucose ( fucose ) residues were detected by the binding of U. europaeus -- FITC conjugate , and N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc2 ) and N-acetylneuraminic acid ( NeuNAc ) residues in combination were detected by the binding of T. vulgaris -- TRITC conjugate . 
An analysis of the binding of fluorescent lectins was carried out with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning microscope mounted on a Nikon Microphot-SA microscope . 
CLSM OTSs ( n = 15 ) were collected in each of the three channels to determine EPS biomass at various depths . 
Digital image analyses were performed using NIH Image version 1.61 , with macros written for semi-automate quantification , to semi-quantitatively estimate EPS glycoconjugate composition , as previously reported ( Lawrence et al. , 1998 ; Neu et al. , 2001 ) . 
Image analyses and calculations of lectinbinding volumes were carried out using the equations , as described previously ( Neu et al. , 2001 ) . 
Three color red -- green -- blue projections of the biofilms were prepared using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 . 
2.8. Protein expression analysis and protein identification
Biofilms were aseptically scraped from the flow cell channels . 
Both biofilm and planktonic cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 5 min . 
Total cellular proteins from biofilm and planktonic cells were electrophoretically separated by Two Dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( 2D-PAGE ) , as detailed previously ( Mangalappalli-Illathu and Korber , 2006 ) . 
After electrophoresis , the gels were silver stained , scanned on an Epson 1200C scanner with a transparency adapter as 8-bit grayscale 300 dpi images , and stored . 
Differentially-expressed proteins were then detected and quantified from the stored images using Phoretix ™ 2D version 2004 analysis software ( Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd , Newcastle upon Tyne , UK ) . 
An increase in the protein spot volume of 1.5-fold or more was interpreted as up-regulation , whereas a decrease in the spot volume of 1.5-fold or more was interpreted as down-regulation . 
Differentially-expressed proteins were identified by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectometry ( LC-MS/MS ) analysis using a capLC interfaced to a Q-ToF Ultima Global hybrid tandem mass spectrometer fitted with a Z-spray nanoelectrospray ion source ( Waters-Micromass , Manchester , UK ) . 
Protein spots of interest were collected from 2D-PAGE gels stained by modified silver staining protocol provided by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Inc. . 
Protein spots were excised from the gel , destained , and in-gel digested with trypsin in accordance with the established protocols for the MassPrep robotic workstation ( Waters-Micromass ) . 
LC-MS/MS data were processed using ProteinLynx software ( Waters-Micromass ) and searched against the NCBInr , MSDB , or Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL protein databases using Mascot Search ( Matrix Science Ltd. , London , UK ) . 
The biological functions of each protein identified were determined from the Wellcome Trust Sanger

All experimental data represent the arithmetic mean of at least three experiments . 
Differential protein expression of low-flow and high-flow Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms was determined from averaged ( i.e. , arithmetic mean ) spot volumes from four gels replicated experimentally , with a maximum variation of 30 % in spot volume between the gels . 
Planktonic cell dispersion data and biofilm thickness , biomass , and viability data were analyzed using SAS statistical software ( version 9.1.3 ; SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) ; and the Fisher 's least significant difference ( LSD ) method was used to test for significant ( P b0 .05 ) differences . 
3. Results
3.1 . 
Influence of flow velocity on the steady-state growth of biofilms 
Effluent from glass flow cells and silicone tubing was collected aseptically at 12 h intervals , serially diluted and plated during 168 h in order to enumerate the number of released cells ( arithmetic mean ; n = 4 ) present in the effluent . 
After 12 h of growth on silicone tubing surfaces , the number of cells in the effluent was approximately 1.6 × 104 cfu ml − 1 and 4.8 × 102 cfu ml − 1 for low-flow and high-flow velocities , respectively . 
The number of cells per milliliter released from glass surfaces at low-flow and high-flow were much higher ( 5.1 × 107 cfu ml − 1 and 6.1 × 106 cfu ml − 1 , respectively ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The number of cells released per sampling interval from either surface increased continuously after the 12 h sampling period until a steady-state release of cells was achieved at ∼ 96 h with the release of ∼ 3.5 × 108 cfu ml − 1 under both low-flow and highflow velocities . 
The number of released cells remained relatively constant over the 96 h to 168 h period .

The error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean . 
3.2. Influence of flow velocity on the architecture of biofilms
Biofilms cultivated under low - and high-flow conditions initially consisted of discrete microcolonies which developed into diffuse growth via the coalescence of microcolonies under low-flow conditions by 192 h. Under high-flow conditions over the same period microcolonies developed into a considerably thicker growth with large bacterial mounds interspersed by water channels ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The mean thickness ( n = 225 ) of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms steadily increased until about 144 h under low-flow conditions , and until 120 h under highflow conditions ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The mean thickness of biofilms grown at high-flow varied over time , but generally increased over the first 120 h. Bacterial mounds in high-flow biofilms were 36 ± 3 µm ( arithmetic mean ± standard error of the mean ; n = 225 ) in thickness , with minimum and maximum thickness measurements ranging between 12 and 60 µm , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) ; the high-flow biofilms were twice as thick as Salmo-nella Enteritidis biofilms grown at low-flow velocities ( 16 ± 2 µm ) . 
Biofilms grown under low-flow conditions were less thick and less variable ( Fig. 3 ) , whereas biofilms grown at highflow conditions were of variable thickness at different locations and found to contain water channels , mounds , and branching structures ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The biofilm biomass distribution was calculated by quantifying the percentage of area covered ( n = 15 ) by negatively-stained cells per microscopic field ( 8,067 µm2 ) . 
It was determined that the biomass of high-flow biofilm was generally equal to , or slightly greater than , that of the low-flow biofilms ( Fig. 4 ) . 
This was most apparent over time at the biofilm -- substratum interface ( 0 µm OTS depth ) . 
At the 3.7 µm optical section depth , there was often a significantly higher ( P b 0.05 ) amount of biomass in the high-flow biofilms . 
There was significantly less biofilm biomass in the outer layers ( 7.4 , 11.1 , and 14.8 µm OTSs ) than near the biofilm -- substratum interface for both low-flow and high-flow biofilms ; however , the greater overall thickness of high-flow biofilms reflected the presence of less dense cell material held in place by non-negatively-staining polymeric material . 
The viability of the cells was assessed by staining the biofilms with the BacLight ™ Live/Dead Viability probe ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The viable and non-viable biomass at the 0 , 3.7 , 7.4 , 11.1 , and 14.8 µm OTS depths were analyzed as the percentage of area covered by viable and non-viable biomass ( n = 15 ) . 
Overall , the proportion of viable biomass was found to be 14 to 20-fold higher than the proportion of non-viable biomass both in low-flow and highflow biofilms over the 168 h growth period .

3.3 . 
Influence of flow velocity on the glycoconjugate composition of biofilms 
Lectin-binding analyses ( n = 15 ) demonstrated that flow velocity significantly influenced the glycoconjugate composition of EPS of the biofilms ( Figs. 6 and 7 ; Table 1 ) . 
Our experiments showed that G. max -- CY5 , T. vulgaris -- TRITC , and U. europaeus -- FITC had the most extensive binding among the eight fluor-conjugated lectins analyzed for their binding to glycoconjugate residues of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms . 
Low-flow biofilms contained 55.2 % GalNAc residues in their EPS ; whereas , high-flow biofilms contained only 1.2 % GalNAc residues . 
Conversely , low-flow biofilms contained 33.1 % of

Protein expression patterns of low-flow and high-flow biofilms 
The proteome of 168 h-old low-flow and high-flow biofilms were compared with each other and that of 168 h-old planktonic cells continuously cultured using 2D-PAGE . 
There were about 120 protein spots in the planktonic cell gel image ; whereas , about 82 spots were identified in the biofilm gels . 
The majority of these proteins ( 48 spots ) were found to become downregulated when the cells were cultured as biofilms , relative to the planktonic cell control proteome . 
However , a few ( 20 ) proteins were found to be up-regulated . 
Overall , there was considerable similarity in the proteome of low-flow and high-flow biofilms ; however , the proteomes of both biofilms were significantly different from that of the planktonic cell control proteome ( Fig. 8 ) . 
We identified 32 differentially-expressed proteins ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . 
Among these proteins , 11 and 14 proteins were found to be up-regulated in low-flow and high-flow biofilms , respectively . 
However , 18 proteins were found to be downregulated in both biofilm systems . 
Three proteins ( GpmA , RpiA , and MalE ) , were found to be unchanged in their level of expression in low-flow biofilms , but became up-regulated in high-flow biofilms ( Table 2 ) . 
Major up-regulated proteins included those involved in degradation ( PduA ) , energy metabolism ( GapA , GpmA , Pgk , and RpiA ) , protein translation and modification ( Tsf and TufA ) , RNA synthesis , RNA modification , and DNA transcription ( RpoZ ) , cell processes ( Crr , MalE , and PtsH ) and adaptation ( GrcA ) . 
Two hypothetical proteins , YcbL and YnaF , were also found to be up-regulated ( Table 2 ) . 
Major down-regulated proteins were those involved in degradation ( GarR ) , proteolysis ( DegQ ) , energy metabolism ( AtpA , TpiA , Mdh , TalB , AceA , and AceK ) , cell envelope formation ( RfbH , FljB , and FliC ) , nutrient-binding ( ArgT , MglB , and OppA ) , detoxification ( Tpx and SodB ) , chaperone protein Hsp70 ( DnaK ) and the hypothetical protein GntY ( Table 3 ) . 
4. Discussion
In the present study , the timing and number of planktonic cells that released from the biofilms growing in low-flow and highflow settings was used to assess when biofilms attained a pseudo-steady-state growth condition , and helped to define the extent of cell shedding from either glass or silicone tubing surfaces ( materials both used in our flow cell model systems ) . 
The developmental kinetics of attached microorganisms has previously been shown to occur in a reproducible fashion , and cell dispersion ( the release of cells from developing biofilms into the aqueous phase ) has been used as a measurable parameter of biofilm development ( Korber et al. , 1989 ; Lawrence et al. , 1997 ) . 
Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms invariably reached the pseudo-steady-state condition on either silicone or glass surfaces by ∼ 96 h irrespective of flow velocity . 
While the factors that influence the timing of cell dispersion from biofilms are only beginning to be understood , both intrinsic genetic elements ( csrA in E. coli , PP0164 and PP0165 genes in Pseudomonas putida , etc. ) and external environmental cues ( glucose , nitrogen and phosphorus availability , O2 depletion , shear stress , etc. ) have been shown to be involved ( Jackson et al. , 2002 ; Gjermansen et al. , 2005 ) . 
The formation of microcolonies was a common feature of low-flow and high-flow biofilms during the early stages ( until 48 h ) of development , as reported previously ( Purevdorj et al. , 2002 ) . 
These microcolonies ultimately merged as the biofilms matured , but were still evident as bacterial mounds separated by voids or water channels . 
At steady-state ( ∼ 96 h ) , Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms exhibited the architecture typical of monospecies bio-films , with cell aggregates or mounds interlaced with exopolymer and surrounded by open areas or channels where nutrient medium flowed ( Fig. 2 ) ( Lawrence et al. , 1991 ; Davey and O'Toole , 2000 ) . 
The thicknesses of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms thus varied considerably with location ( whether the random thickness measurement occurred within a mound or in the separating water channel between mounds ) , and also had high thickness measurement standard deviations ( 16 ± 10 µm and 36 ± 24 µm for low-flow and high-flow biofilms at 120 h , respectively ) ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Parameters such as mean biofilm thickness have been used to measure the impact of mutations in genes involved in motility , cell signaling , and stationary phase σ-factor on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development ( Heydorn et al. , 2002 ) . 
There was considerably more variation in the thickness of high-flow biofilms . 
This difference is contributed to by a number of processes , in particular nutrient limitation and growth , sloughing , and regrowth of biofilm material . 
During the initial 24 h of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilm development , there was no significant effect of nutrient flow velocity on conformation and distribution of microcolonies ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
However , the mean maximum width of water channels in high-flow Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms increased from 25.3 ± 5.3 µm ( arithmetic mean ± standard deviation ; n = 24 ) at 144 h , to 33.2 ± 10.3 µm by 192 h ( Fig. 2D and F ) . 
In contrast , channel width decreased due to increased EPS production in Sphingomonas biofilms ( Venugopalan et al. , 2005 ) . 
Exopolymers played a significant role in the architecture of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms , as the biofilms grown under high-flow conditions were subject to visible flow peristalsis-induced viscoelasticity . 
It has been reported that biofilm viscoelasticity allows the biofilms to structurally deform when exposed to varying shear stresses ( Stoodley et al. , 2000 ) , a mechanism that allows the biofilms to resist erosion due to increased fluid shear by deformation while remaining attached to the surface ( Rupp et al. , 2005 ) . 
It is generally accepted that channel formation improves the diffusion-dominated transport of nutrients and waste materials into and out of the biofilm matrix ; therefore , it is envisaged that the Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms are highly polymorphic and structurally-adapted to changes in substratum chemistry , flow velocity and thus nutrient availability and waste removal . 
The identification of chemical heterogeneities spatiallylocalized within biofilms using fluor-conjugated lectins ( Neu and Lawrence , 1999 ; Neu et al. , 2001 ; Laue et al. , 2006 ) could help explain the various roles of EPS in these systems . 
In this study , nutrient flow velocity was implicated in a shift in glycoconjugate composition of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms . 
The major glycoconjugate component of the EPS of low-flo biofilms was found to be GalNAc residues ; whereas , in highflow biofilms the major component was fucose . 
Flow velocity apparently induced high-flow biofilms to alter their extracellular glycoconjugates by increasing fucose concentration as an adaptive mechanism to enhanced fluid shear , possibly favoring deformation . 
Compositional changes in biofilm EPS in response to various conditions , including nutrients , growth medium , pH , temperature , substratum ( surface material ) , and developmental time have previously been reported ( Oliveira et al. , 1994 ; Lee et al. , 1997 ; Tavernier et al. , 1997 ; Maki et al. , 2000 ; Lawrence et al. , 2004 , 2005 ) . 
Combining the qualitative and quantitative information , it was concluded that high-flow biofilms were more compact over the 0 to 15 µm OTS depths than were the low-flow biofilms ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . 
When the fluid velocity increased , the ratio of viable to non-viable biomass also increased ( Fig. 5 ) , indicating that the flow velocity did not cause any stress on high-flow biofilms , but actually served to enhance growth and development . 
In general , low-flow biofilms were found to consist of single cells arranged rigidly in compact masses ( Fig. 6A and B ) ; whereas , high-flow biofilm cells were loosely arranged and included long chains or filaments ( Fig. 6C and D ) . 
These elongated chains of cells may represent phenotypic variants due to the decreased O2 or nutrients , as well as responses to other stress factors ( Korber et al. , 1994 ) , suggesting that the metabolism of biofilm bacteria had shifted between flow regimens . 
Differential protein expression of planktonic and biofilm modes of growth has been reported in E. coli O157 : H7 ( Trémoulet et al. , 2002 ) , P. putida ( Sauer and Camper , 2001 ) , Bacillus cereus ( Oosthuizen et al. , 2002 ) , and Staphylococcus aureus ( Resch et al. , 2005 ) . 
In this study , out of the 14 proteins up-regulated in high-flow biofilms ( relative to the planktonic cell control ) , 11 were also up-regulated in their levels of expression in low-flow biofilms , and three proteins ( GpmA , RpiA , and MalE ) were up-regulated in the high-flow biofilms only . 
However , all 18 proteins down-regulated in high-flow biofilms were found to be down-regulated in low-flow biofilms . 
Overall , there was significant similarity in the protein expression profiles of both low - and high-flow biofilm systems , with the exception of the expression levels of GpmA , RpiA , and MalE . 
In S. enterica , PduA was suggested to be involved in 1,2-propanediol ( 1,2-PD ) utilization to allow use of this compound as a carbon source for energy generation ( Jeter and Roth , 1987 ) . 
Interestingly , the up-regulation of PduA observed in low - and high-flow biofilms suggests that these cells utilized the 1,2-PD utilization pathway perhaps for energy generation , minimizing aldehyde toxicity , or for cobalamin biosynthesis . 
Proteins involved in degradation of carbon compounds ( GarR ) and proteins ( DegQ ) were significantly down-regulated in both biofilm systems relative to the planktonic cell control proteome . 
Similarly , proteases were found to be up-regulated in planktonic S. aureus cells in comparison with the biofilm cells ( Resch et al. , 2005 ) . 
Among the proteins involved in energy generation , GapA , GpmA , Pgk , and RpiA were significantly upregulated ; whereas , AtpA , TpiA , Mdh , and TalB were found to be down-regulated . 
In contrast , malate dehydrogenase ( Mdh ) has been found to be up-regulated in E. coli O157 : H7 biofilms 
( Trémoulet et al. , 2002 ) . 
Two enzymes involved in glyoxylate bypass , AceA and AceK , were found to be down-regulated in both low - and high-flow biofilms . 
The down-regulation of both AceA and AceK indicate that biofilms did not employ glyoxylate bypass during acetate metabolism for energy generation ( Chung et al. , 1988 ) . 
Some proteins involved in nutrient-binding and transport , namely , Crr ( glucose ) , MalE ( maltose ) , PtsH ( various sugars ) were found to be up-regulated . 
ArgT ( lysine , arginine , and ornithine ) , MglB ( galactose and glucose ) , and OppA ( oligo-peptides ) were found to be downregulated . 
There are reports that D-galactose binding protein and amino acid ABC transporter-binding protein were up-regulated in E. coli O157 : H7 biofilms ( Trémoulet et al. , 2002 ) . 
Increased protein biosynthesis in both biofilm systems was deduced from the up-regulation of translation elongation factors ( TufA and Tsf ) and a protein involved in DNA transcription and RNA synthesis ( RpoZ ) . 
The translational elongation factor G ( Fus ) has recently been reported to be up-regulated in S. aureus biofilms ( Resch et al. , 2005 ) , as were translational elongation factors in Listeria monocytogenes biofilms ( Hefford et al. , 2005 ) . 
However , proteins involved in synthesis of structural components of the cell envelope , namely , lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein ( RfbH ) and flagellar biosynthesis proteins ( FljB and FliC ) , were found to be down-regulated in biofilms during the present study . 
There are similar reports that FliC was expressed in planktonic cells of P. putida but not in biofilms ; however , two different lipopoly-saccharide biosynthesis proteins , LpxD and WbpG appeared to be up-regulated in P. putida biofilms ( Sauer and Camper , 2001 ) . 
The patterns of up - and down-regulation of proteins involved in adaptation to hydrodynamic conditions were similar in low-and high-flow biofilms . 
GrcA , which acts as a radical domain for damaged pyruvate/formate lyase was significantly upregulated . 
However , chaperone protein Hsp70 ( DnaK ) , which is involved in heat-shock and similar stress response conditions , and SodB and Tpx involved in survival of oxidative stress , were significantly down-regulated in both biofilm systems . 
Thus , it is envisaged that low - and high-flow biofilms experienced more or less similar stress conditions , something one would expect if structural changes to the biofilms were responses that served to minimize overall stress . 
In the case of high-flow biofilms , the increased shear stress might have been compensated by the shift in extracellular glycoconjugate composition and the increased mass transfer of nutrients into the biofilms and removal of waste materials brought about by the architectural adaptation ( i.e. , formation of water channels and mounds ) . 
The protein expression patterns of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms appeared to be unique relative to planktonic cells and presumed to be significantly influenced by the nutrient composition and other environmental or stress factors ; however , flow velocity at the rates tested did not have a significant effect . 
In conclusion , a 10-fold difference in nutrient laminar flow velocity significantly influenced the development and architecture of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms . 
The thickness of Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms was related to the velocity of nutrient laminar flow , and biofilms grown under low-flow conditions contained a higher volume of EPS than high-flow biofilms ; the composition of glycoconjugates detected were als distinct . 
The protein expression patterns of the biofilms were essentially similar , indicating that the distinct biofilm architectures and patterns of EPS composition exhibited under the different flow regimens were a physical consequence of flow , but did not involve major shifts in protein expression ( at least not at the point of steady-state equilibrium ) . 
These findings suggest that complex mechanisms are operational that result in modification of extracellular glycoconjugates that are not dependent upon large-scale shifts in protein expression , or that chemical evidence of this event was simply not seen since proteomic analysis was only performed at 168 h . 
These results are also supportive of the notion that biofilms are automatonic systems that respond to physical and chemical conditions such as flow rate and nutrients , with the end result being different biofilm architectures that optimize conditions ( Van Loosdrecht et al. , 1997 ; Wimpenny and Colasanti , 1997 ) . 
While the proteomes of biofilms cultivated under low - and high-flow conditions were not significantly different , the biofilm protein expression patterns were significantly different from that of planktonic Salmonella Enteritidis cells . 
It is suggested that Salmonella Enteritidis biofilms were structurally-adapted to changes in substratum chemistry and flow velocity , which is significant in the survival of this pathogen as biofilms . 
This also has significance in controlling biofilms on food processing surfaces , as hydrodynamic conditions generated by mechanical processes like routine scrubbing have limited and short-term effects .
