Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium does not survive a pH 2.5 acid challenge under conditions similar to those used for Escherichia coli ( J. W. Foster , Nat . 
Rev. Microbiol . 
2:898 -- 907 , 2004 ) . 
Here , we provide evidence that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium can display arginine-dependent acid resistance ( AR ) provided the cells are grown under anoxic conditions and not under the microaerobic conditions used for assessment of AR in E. coli . 
The role of the arginine decarboxylase pathway in Salmonella AR was shown by the loss of AR in mutants lacking adiA , which encodes arginine decarboxylase ; adiC , which encodes the arginine-agmatine antiporter ; or adiY , which encodes an AraC-like regulator . 
Transcription of adiA and adiC was found to be dependent on AdiY , anaerobiosis , and acidic pH. 
Acid resistance ( AR ) in the Enterobacteriaceae requires the presence of amino acids in the challenge medium ; while Esch-erichia coli and Shigella ﬂexneri are classiﬁed as AR , it has repeatedly been found that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium does not survive a pH 2.5 acid challenge under conditions similar to those used for E. coli ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 ) . 
The AR mechanisms in E. coli have been demonstrated by several researchers ; they enable this organism to survive at pHs as low as 2.5 ( 15 , 16 , 20 ) . 
The ﬁrst AR system in E. coli ( AR 1 ) is apparent when cells are grown to stationary phase in rich medium and subsequently challenged in EG mineral medium at pH 2.5 ( 4 ) . 
The alternative sigma factor RpoS and the global regulatory protein cyclic AMP receptor protein regulate AR 1 . 
Repression of AR 1 by glucose permitted the discovery of the amino acid-dependent AR systems in E. coli ( 15 ) . 
Cells that have been grown in rich medium , pH 5.5 , to stationary phase in the presence of glucose survive dilution in mineral medium , pH 2.5 , only in the presence of glutamate ( AR 2 ) , arginine ( AR 3 ) , and to a lesser extent lysine ( AR 4 ) ( 4 , 13 ) . 
AR 2 is the most extensively studied mechanism of the three amino acid decarboxylase systems in E. coli ( 5 , 9 ) , but it seems to be absent from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( 15 ) . 
The genes for the AR 3 system are present in E. coli and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium but seem to contribute to AR only in E. coli . 
In E. coli , the arginine decarboxylase ( adiA ) and the arginine-agmatine anti-porter ( adiC ) are responsible for acid resistance ( 11 ) . 
CysB is a positive regulator of adi transcription , and , when overexpressed , the AraC-like regulator AdiY is also involved in regulation of adiA ( 19 , 22 ) . 
The AR 4 system is not present in E. coli , but in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium the lysine decarboxylase ( cadA ) and the lysine-cadaverine antiporter

( cadB ) work in concert to protect this organism at pHs as low as 3.0 ( 18 ) . 
It has generally been recognized that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium is not able to survive pH values as low as 2.5 ( 9 , 12 , 15 ) . 
Recently , however , de Jonge et al. ( 7 ) showed that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was able to survive in mineral medium at pH 2.5 for a prolonged period of time , and this triggered us to investigate the role of L-arginine in AR 3 in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in more detail . 
Arginine-dependent AR in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
AR 3 in stationary-phase S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells grown in LBG was determined as described previously ( 3 ) . 
In short , 10 l of stationary-phase culture was transferred to 10 ml of fresh EG mineral medium at pH 2.5 . 
EG mineral me-dium consisted of Vogel-Bonner mineral medium E ( 24 ) , 100 mM MES ( morpholineethanesulfonic acid ) , 10 mM L-arginine , and 4 g/liter of glucose at pH 2.5 . 
Growth of the cells in a 10-ml ﬁlled screw-cap culture tube without shaking created anoxic conditions . 
Without the addition of L-arginine , the number of surviving bacteria decreased by more than 4 log after 1 h at pH 2.5 . 
The amounts of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strain BAA-188 ( 2 ) that survived in challenge medium supplemented with L-arginine were approximately 59.4 % and 12.5 % after 1 and 2 h , respectively , at pH 2.5 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Similar results were obtained for the other serovar DT104 strains . 
The survival rates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ( 10 ) and UK1 ( 6 ) at pH 2.5 were slightly higher , at approximately 83 % and 38 % after 1 and 2 h , respectively . 
The results presented describe for the ﬁrst time arginine-dependent stationary-phase AR in S. enterica serovar Typhi-murium under conditions similar to those used for E. coli . 
All seven S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains tested displayed this phenotype , suggesting a common property of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains . 
Omission of L-arginine from the challenge medium resulted in an acid-sensitive phenotype in all S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains tested . 
Our results show that the LT2 strain displays AR similar to those of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strains , which were shown in a previous study by Berk et al. ( 3 ) to contain wild-type rpoS . 
This indicates , as suggested by Park et al. ( 17 ) , that RpoS has no major role , if any role at all , in AR 3 in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Role of oxygen in arginine-dependent AR S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 . 
Previous reports stated that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium does not survive pH 2.5 acid challenge under conditions similar to those used for E. coli ( 9 , 12 , 15 ) . 
Notably , in those studies cells grown under microaerobic conditions were used . 
Therefore , we assessed the role of oxygen in more detail in the development of arginine-dependent AR in Salmonella during culturing . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strain BAA-188 was grown to stationary phase in LBG , pH 5 , under anoxic , microaerobic , and aerobic conditions and subsequently challenged in mineral medium supplemented with 20 mM L-arginine at pH 2.5 under different oxygen conditions ( Table 1 ) . 
Aerobic cultures ( 10 ml ) were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks with shaking at 225 rpm . 
Cultures a Aerobic , microaerobic , and anaerobic stationary-phase cells grown in LBG at pH 5 were challenged in EG mineral medium , pH 2.5 , with 20 mM L-arginine at an initial concentration of approximately 1 106 CFU/ml under different oxygen conditions . 
All experiments were performed twice in triplicate . 
The detection limit was 5 102 CFU/ml . 
grown under microaerobic conditions , the standard conditions used for assessment of E. coli AR ( 15 ) , were obtained by growing the cells in 3 ml of medium in 15 - by 150-mm test tubes with shaking at 225 rpm . 
Analysis of stationary-phase AR under different oxygen conditions revealed that both aerobically and microaerobically grown stationary-phase S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were unable to survive at pH 2.5 , whereas anaerobically grown cells again showed excellent survival . 
Moreover , the presence of oxygen during the AR test at pH 2.5 resulted in a decreased survival capacity . 
Under microaerobic challenge conditions , approximately 18.4 % and 1.2 % of the anaerobically grown cells survived after 1 and 2 h , respectively . 
Under aerobic conditions , the survival of these cells decreased even further , to approximately 7.8 % and 0.3 % after 1 and 2 h , respectively . 
Obviously , the oxygen condition during growth is a critical determinant of the arginine-dependent AR phenotype in Sal-monella ; i.e. , only anaerobically grown stationary-phase cells display the AR phenotype . 
Our results offer an explanation for the lack of AR noted by other researchers , since in their experiments microaerobic growth conditions were used for testing AR at pH 2.5 ( 9 , 12 , 15 ) . 
Culture conditions that resulted in an AR phenotype in E. coli did not result in an AR phenotype in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Apparently , development of arginine-dependent AR in Salmonella is strictly dependent on anoxic growth conditions . 
Role of the arginine decarboxylase pathway in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 AR . 
To assess the role of the arginine decarboxylase system in S. enterica serovar Typhi-murium DT104 AR at pH 2.5 , several mutants in the adi gene cluster were constructed . 
Suicide plasmids were constructed by PCR ampliﬁcation of an internal fragment of the target gene with Pwo polymerase ( Roche Diagnostics , Almere , The Neth-erlands ) and subsequent insertion in the pir-dependent plasmid pERFORM-Z ( 1 ) by methods described previously ( 14 ) . 
Single-crossover transconjugants were selected with zeocin ( 25 g/ml ml ) and tetracycline ( 12.5 g/ml ) for counterselection against E. coli upon conjugation . 
PCR and Southern analysi conﬁrmed that the selected strains harbored the inserted antibiotic resistance cassette or plasmid ( data not shown ) . 
In this way , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strain BAA-188 adiA ( arginine decarboxylase ) , adiY ( regulator of adiA ) , yjdB ( putative antiporter in the adi gene cluster ) , and adiC ( argin-ine-agmatine antiporter ) deletion mutants were obtained . 
As demonstrated in Fig. 2 , disruption of the arginine decarboxylase gene adiA results in an AR of 0.014 % after 2 h at pH 2.5 , compared to 68.6 % for the wild type . 
A dramatic loss of AR was also observed in the adiY ( transcriptional regulator ) and adiC ( arginine-agmatine antiporter ) deletion mutants , which showed 0.035 % and 0.048 % survival , respectively , after 2 h at pH 2.5 in challenge medium supplemented with 20 mM L-arginine . 
Disruption of yjdB , encoding a putative antiporter , downstream of adiC did not result in loss of the AR phenotype . 
The arginine decarboxylase system has been implicated in AR in E. coli and Shigella ﬂexneri ( 15 ) . 
From the results presented here , it is obvious that the arginine decarboxylase system , including the arginine decarboxylase ( adiA ) , the AraC-like regulator ( adiY ) , and the arginine-agmatine antiporter ( adiC ) , confers AR in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Expression of adi genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strain BAA-188 . 
RNA from mid-logarithmic-phase S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 strain BAA-188 cultures grown in LBG was extracted with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase ( Pro-mega , Leiden , The Netherlands ) , as recommended by the supplier . 
Subsequently the expression of adiA , adiC , and adiY was examined by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) using the Bio-Rad MyiQ single-color real-time PCR detection system ( Bio-Rad , Veenendaal , The Netherlands ) and the iQ SYBR green Supermix kit ( Bio-Rad ) , as recommended by the manufacturer . 
Primer sets were designed with Beacon Designer , version 4.02 ( PREMIER Biosoft International , Palo Alto , CA ) . 
After optimization , the mean relative expression values were calculated . 
Expression of adiA and adiC was found to be induced by acid and anoxic growth conditions ( Table 2 ) . 
Similar results have been reported for transcription regulation of adiA in E. coli ( 11 , 21 ) and adiC in Salmonella ( 17 ) . 
The expression of adiY appears to be higher in Salmonella grown under aerobic conditions and to not be affected by the pH. It has been reported that the XylS/AraC-like transcriptional regulator AdiY , which is part adi gene cluster , acts as a positive regulator of adiA in E. coli ( 22 ) . 
The data presented here reveal that adiY is essential for induction of arginine-dependent AR in Salmo-nella . 
Indeed , qPCR analysis revealed transcription of adiA and adiC to be reduced signiﬁcantly in the adiY deletion mutant ( Table 2 ) . 
Recently , Gong et al. ( 11 ) suggested that AdiY acts as a conditional regulator for adiA , as they failed to shown a reduction in adiA transcription in an E. coli adiY deletion mutant . 
In E. coli , furthermore , the XylS/AraC-like transcriptional regulators EnvY and AppY were shown to stimulate adiA transcription ( 22 ) . 
In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , however , adiY has a unique role in that it is essential in the a RNA for the tpiA gene , encoding the triose-phosphate isomerase that converts D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into glycerone phosphate , was used as a housekeeping gene for normalization ( 23 ) . 
b Relative gene expression of the wild type under anoxic growth conditions at pH 7 was set at 1.0 . 
The standard deviation of the mean change in the experiment was 25 % . 
-- , not determined induction of arginine-dependent AR via direct or indirect transcriptional activation of the adiA and adiC genes . 
In conclusion , this study clearly shows that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has an active arginine-dependent AR mechanism ( AR 3 ) , permitting survival at pH 2.5 . 
The adiA , adiY , and adiC gene products are critically important in Salmonella AR 3 , with adiY playing a crucial role in the regulation of transcription of adiA and adiC . 
Foster recently stated that there was more to the AR 3 system of Salmonella than simply ﬁnding an active arginine decarboxylase and arginine-agmatine anti-porter ( 9 ) . 
From our results , however , it is now clear that the AR 3 system contributes to pH 2.5 acid survival only when Salmonella is grown anaerobically and not under conditions normally used for assessment of AR in E. coli .
