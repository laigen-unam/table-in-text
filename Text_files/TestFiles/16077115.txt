DNA adenine methylase ( Dam ) mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium contain reduced levels of FinP RNA encoded on the virulence plasmid . 
Dam methylation appears to regulate ﬁnP transcription , rather than FinP RNA stability or turnover . 
The ﬁnP promoter includes canonical 10 and 35 modules and depends on the 70 factor . 
Regulation of ﬁnP transcription by Dam methylation does not require DNA sequences upstream from the 35 module , indicating that Dam acts at the promoter itself or downstream . 
Unexpectedly , a GATC site overlapping with the 10 module is likewise dispensable for Dam-mediated regulation . 
These observations indicate that Dam methylation regulates ﬁnP transcription indirectly and suggest the involvement of a host factor ( s ) responsive to the Dam methylation state of the cell . 
We provide evidence that one such factor is the nucleoid protein H-NS , which acts as a repressor of ﬁnP transcription in a Dam background . 
H-NS also restrains transcription of the overlapping traJ gene , albeit in a Dam-independent fashion . 
Hence , the decreased FinP RNA content found in Dam hosts of S. enterica appears to result from H-NS-mediated repression of ﬁnP transcription . 
The F sex factor and its relatives have served as a paradigm of bacterial conjugation for six decades ( 62 ) . 
Early studies carried out with F paved the way for the discovery of plasmids in other bacterial genera . 
For instance , a plasmid initially called `` cryptic '' and later found to contain virulence genes was discovered in the standard strain LT2 of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( 51 , 52 ) . 
Virulence plasmids are also found in other strains of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , such as the mouse virulent strains SL1344 and 14028 , and in other host-adapted serotypes of S. enterica except the human-adapted serovar Typhi ( 46 ) . 
The virulence plasmid of S. enterica strain LT2 ( pSLT ) is self-transmissible ( 1 ) . 
Unlike F , pSLT undergoes conjugation at low frequencies ( 1 , 5 ) , and the genetic mechanism that maintains conjugal repression can cross-regulate F transfer ( 48 , 51 , 59 ) . 
Repression of mating is the norm for most F-like plasmids , and it relies on the so-called fertility inhibition system ( 17 ) . 
Transcription of the main transfer operon ( tra ) , which encodes functions for pilus synthesis and DNA processing during conjugal transfer , requires activation by the TraJ protein , encoded on a nearby monocistronic transcriptional unit ( 18 , 19 , 41 ) . 
Synthesis of the TraJ transcriptional activator is prevented by a small , untranslated RNA encoded by an overlapping gene , ﬁnP ( 20 , 41 ) .

and the traJ mRNA leader triggers degradation of the RNA duplex by RNase III ( 29 ) , a phenomenon reminiscent of the RNA interference mechanism described in eukaryotes ( 38 ) . 
FinP RNA is a short-lived molecule unless it is stabilized by the FinO protein ( 30 ) . 
FinO protects FinP RNA from degradation by RNase E ( 29 ) and acts as an RNA chaperone that facilitates RNA-RNA interactions ( 2 ) . 
The F sex factor is a FinO mutant ( 8 ) , and the ability of pSLT to repress F transfer relies on providing trans-acting FinO protein ( 48 ) . 
In certain F-like plasmids , activation of the main tra promoter , traY , is also activated by transcription of the plasmid-borne gene traM . 
Transcripts originating at the traM promoter appear to enter the neighboring traJ gene , thereby providing a two-cistron mRNA that can unbalance the ﬁnP / traJ transcriptional ratio and yield TraJ product for the activation of the traY promoter ( 11 ) . 
Besides these plasmid-encoded regulators of tra operon expression , chromosomal regulators of mating are also known ( 39 ) . 
The list includes the transcriptional regulators ArcA ( 55 , 57 ) and CRP ( 53 ) , the nucleoid protein H-NS ( 54 , 61 ) , the leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( 5 ) , and DNA adenine methylase ( Dam ) methylation ( 59 ) . 
A postranscriptional control mechanism acting on the TraJ product has been also described ( 23 , 50 ) . 
Regulation of conjugal transfer by Dam methylation occurs in F ( 59 ) , pSLT ( 5 ) , and R100 ( 7 ) . 
In all cases , Dam methyl-ation acts as a repressor of mating , and the increase in conjugation frequency detected in Dam donors varies from plasmid to plasmid ( 5 , 7 , 59 ) . 
The increased conjugal ability of Dam mutants was initially correlated with lower levels of FinP RNA ( 59 ) . 
Further studies have shown that repression of pSLT transfer by Dam methylation actually involves two independent , concerted actions : activation of FinP RNA synthesis and repression of traJ transcription ( 6 ) . 
569 
In this study , we have investigated the cause of the lowered FinP RNA levels found in DNA adenine methylase mutants of S. enterica . 
We show that transcription of ﬁnP is repressed in a Dam background by an unusual , indirect mechanism that involves the nucleoid protein H-NS ( 13 ) . 
Our ﬁndings explain the ability of Salmonella and Escherichia coli Dam mutants to undergo conjugation at elevated frequencies ( 5 , 59 ) , and they raise the possibility of a hitherto unknown relationship between Dam methylation and H-NS activity . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and strain construction . 
Unless otherwise indicated , the strains used in this study were derived from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 ( Table 1 ) . 
TR5878 , a transformable strain of S. enterica , was obtained from J. R. Roth , Section of Microbiology , University of California , Davis . 
The hns : : Kmr allele ( 15 ) was provided by N. P. Higgins , University of Alabama , Birmingham . 
E. coli strains P90A5 and UQ295 ( CGSC 6328 ) were obtained from J. L. Ramos , Estación Experimental del Zaidın , CSIC , Granada , Spain . 
The source of the lexA ( Ind ) allele used in this study was strain DA6522 , obtained from D. I. Andersson , Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control , Solna , Sweden . 
Transductional crosses using phage P22 HT ( 49 ) were used for strain construction operations involving chromosomal markers and for transfer of plasmids among Salmonella strains . 
Plasmid pIC552 is a promoter-probe vector that permits the construction of transcriptional lac fusions ( 33 ) . 
pMD1405 , obtained from M. Drummond ( John Innes Institute , Norwich , En-gland ) , is a ColE1 derivative engineered for the construction of translational fusions with a lacZ gene that lacks the ﬁrst eight codons . 
pIZ860 contains a 0.6-kb EcoRI-NaeI insert that includes pSLT DNA from 298 to 362 relative to the tra gene start site cloned on pBluescript II SK ( ) . 
This insert contains a complete ﬁnP gene but lacks the traJ promoter . 
pIZ879 contains a 301-bp HinfI-BamHI fragment from pSLT cloned on BamHI-EcoRV-digested pBluescript II SK ( ) ( 59 ) . 
pIZ880 is a pIC552 derivative that contains a transcriptional ﬁnP : : lac fusion and lacks the traJ promoter of pSLT ( 59 ) . 
pIZ899 carries a 326-bp EcoRV fragment of pSLT ( which includes a complete ﬁnP gene ) cloned onto pBluescript II SK ( ) ( 59 ) . 
pIZ900 is a pMD1405 derivative containing the same 326-bp EcoRV fragment carried by pIZ899 ( 59 ) . 
Construction of plasmid pIZ955 . 
Plasmid pIZ879 was digested with EcoRV and XhoI . 
A 100-bp fragment generated by this digestion was cloned on pIC552 previously digested with NcoI , Klenow end ﬁlled , and digested with XhoI . 
The resulting plasmid ( pIZ955 ) carried a ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusion and 66 bp upstream of the ﬁnP start site . 
Construction of plasmid pIZ981 . 
Plasmid pIZ879 was used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation with the Universal primer of pBluescript and a primer designed ad hoc ( DFP , 5 CGG GAT CCA GAT TGA CTG GCC AGT GTT 3 ) . 
The DFP oligonucleotide introduces a BamHI restriction site located at its 5 end . 
The 163-bp ampliﬁed fragment was puriﬁed , digested with BamHI and XhoI , and cloned on BglII-XhoI-digested pIC552 . 
The resulting plasmid ( pIZ981 ) carries a ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusion and 37 bp upstream of the ﬁnP start site . 
Construction of an hns : : Cmr allele . 
The hns gene was disrupted by adapting to S. enterica the method of Datsenko and Wanner ( 10 ) . 
The oligonucleotides 5 GCC GAC GGC ATT GAC CCG AAT GAA CTG CTG AAT AGC ATG GCT GCC GCT AAA TCC GGT ACC GTG TAG GCT GGA GCT GCT TC 3 and 5 TTT CAC CGT TTT CGT CAA CAT AGC TAT ATT TAG CCG GAC GAG CTG CGC GTT TAG CTT TGA CAT ATG AAT ATC CTC CTT AG 3 were used to PCR amplify the chloramphenicol resistance cassette of plasmid pKD3 ( 10 ) . 
The ampliﬁed plasmid was used to electroporate a derivative of strain TR5878 carrying plasmid pKD46 ( 10 ) , selecting Cmr transformants . 
This procedure yielded a Cmr cassette insertion at the KpnI restriction site of the hns gene , approximately 330 bp downstream from the initiation codon . 
The construct was veriﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation with two oligonucleotides external to the hns gene , 5 TAC ATT CCT GGC TAT TGCA C 3 and 5 TTT TTA TGC CTG GGG TCG TC 3 . 
Construction of a ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusion in the Salmonella virulence plasmid . 
A deletion in the ﬁnP gene of pSLT was generated according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner ( 10 ) . 
Primers were designed to eliminate a 100-bp DNA stretch of traJ from position 2 to position 102 ( EMBL accession number AJ011572 ) . 
The sequences of these oligonucleotides were 5 GTG ACA AAT TAA GGC TGA AAA CAA TAT AGT GTC TTT GTA GGT GTA GGC TGG AGC TGC TTC 3 and 5 ATT GAC TGG CGA GTG TTC TTT CTC TAC GAT CCG TCG GAC ACA TAT GAA TAT CCT CC TTA G 3 . 
The resulting deletion eliminates the whole ﬁnP gene except 3 bp at its 5 end . 
The kanamycin resistance cassette was excised by recombination with plasmid pCP20 ( 10 ) . 
PCR ampliﬁcation using primers from both sides of the pSLT ﬁnP locus identiﬁed kanamycin-sensitive isolates that carried the desired deletion . 
The sequences of these primers were 5 GTA TCT TCA GAG ATG GAA AG 3 and 5 TAT GAT TAC ACG GAA AACGG 3 . 
The resulting FRT site was then used to integrate plasmid pCE37 ( 14 ) , thereby generating a transcriptional ﬁnP : : lac fusion . 
Culture media and growth conditions . 
E medium containing 0.2 % glucose ( 60 ) was used as the minimal medium . 
The rich medium was nutrient broth ( 8 g/liter ; Difco ) with added NaCl ( 5 g/liter ) . 
Solid media contained agar at a 1.5 % ﬁnal concentration . 
Antibiotics and X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galacto-pyranoside ) were used at the concentrations described previously ( 59 ) . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
Levels of - galactosidase activity were assayed as described by Miller ( 40 ) , using the CHCl3-sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) permeabilization procedure . 
RNA extraction . 
RNA preparations were obtained by guanidinium isothiocya-nate lysis and phenol-chloroform extraction ( 9 ) . 
Saturated cultures were immersed in liquid N2 , and 1.4 ml of lysis solution ( 5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate , 50 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 10 mM EDTA , 8 % [ vol/vol ] - mercaptoethanol ) was added . 
Each mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min before 0.28 ml of chloroform was added . 
After gentle shaking and centrifugation at 9,000 rpm for 10 min , 0.66 ml of isopropanol was added to the supernatant . 
The samples were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min and centrifuged again at 9,000 rpm for 15 min . 
The pellets were then rinsed with 70 % ethanol and dried . 
After resuspension in 75 l of water ( with 0.1 % [ vol/vol ] diethyl pyrocarbonate ) , the samples were subjected to standard treatments with DNase and proteinase K , followed by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol ( 47 ) . 
The aqueous phase was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate , pH 4.8 , and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol . 
The samples were then kept at 78 °C for at least 30 min , centrifuged , and washed with 70 % ethanol . 
Finally , the precipitates were dried and resuspended in 20 to 40 l of diethyl pyrocar-bonate-water . 
RNA electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels . 
Samples contained 6 l of the RNA preparation and 4 l of loading buffer containing 50 % formamide . 
After 2 min of incubation at 94 °C , the samples were chilled in ice . 
Electrophoretic separation was carried out on gels prepared with Tris-borate-EDTA ( TBE ) an containing 8 % acrylamide and 7.5 M urea . 
The gels were 12 cm long and 0.75 mm thick . 
Electrophoretic separation was performed at 250 V. Primer extension . 
The oligonucleotide 5 TAA ATC GCC GAT ACA GGG AG 3 , complementary to an internal region of the ﬁnP gene of pSLT ( EMBL accession number AJ011572 ) , was end labeled with [ 32P ] ATP and annealed to 25 g of total RNA prepared from S. enterica strains bearing plasmid pIZ900 ( 59 ) . 
For annealing , 105 cpm of oligonucleotide was used . 
The end-labeled primer was extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) under conditions described previously ( 37 ) . 
The products of reverse transcription were analyzed in urea-poly-acrylamide gels . 
For autoradiography , the gels were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR ﬁlm . 
RNA hybridization against DNA probes . 
RNA was quantiﬁed by the A / A 260 280 ratio , using a Beckman DU spectrophotometer . 
Aliquots were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel under the conditions described above . 
After electrophoretic separation of RNA , the polyacrylamide gels were treated with cold TBE ( 0.5 ) for 15 min . 
Transfer to nylon ﬁlters was achieved with a Transblot SD Semidry Transfer Cell system from Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , Calif. . 
Transfer was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 400 mA at intensities below 25 V. Prehybridization and hybridization were both carried out at 38 °C , and formamide was not used . 
After transfer , the ﬁlters were stained with a solution of 0.3 % methylene blue in 0.3 M sodium acetate , pH 5.2 , to conﬁrm both the efﬁciency of transfer and the presence of equivalent amounts of RNA per lane . 
As a loading control , rRNA fragments , which were readily visible in the stained gel , were quantiﬁed using Image Gauge software in a Fujiﬁlm FLA-3000 Image System . 
The presence of equivalent amounts of RNA per lane was thus conﬁrmed . 
Loads that showed differences below 10 % were not considered signiﬁcant . 
The 5 TAA ATC GCC GAT ACA GGG AG 3 probe , complementary to an internal ﬁnP region , was end labeled with [ 32P ] ATP . 
After hybridization , the nylon ﬁlters were washed twice at room temperature with 6 SSC ( 1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) , 0.1 % SDS for 5 min . 
Two or more additional washes were carried out with either 0.6 SSC-0 .1 % SDS or 3 SSC-0 .1 % SDS for 15 min at room temperature . 
The ﬁlters were then exposed to an X-ray ﬁlm for 1 to 7 days . 
Sequencing reactions were carried out with the Sequenase DNA sequencing . 
2.0 sequencing kit ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , Ohio ) . 
The manufacturer 's instructions were followed . 
Additionally , 1 l of unlabeled dATP ( 10 M ) was added to the reaction mixtures . 
Sequencing gels were prepared in TBE and contained 6 % acrylamide and 500 g/liter urea . 
The gels were run in a Poker Face SE1500 sequencer ( Hoeffer Scientiﬁc Instruments , San Francisco , Calif. ) ; dried in a Slab Gel Dryer , model SE1160 ( Hoeffer Scientiﬁc Instruments ) ; and developed by exposure to X-ray ﬁlm . 
Determination of plasmid copy number by quantitative PCR . 
A method of DNA extraction that does not modify the chromosome/plasmid DNA ratio was adapted from Brandi et al. ( 4 ) . 
Five-milliliter overnight cultures were washed once with 1 ml of 1 M NaCl and three times with 1 ml of TE ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA ) . 
The cells were ﬁnally resuspended in 200 l TE and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thawing followed by 5 min if boiling . 
After appropriate dilutions , aliquots of the crude cell extracts were subjected to quantitative PCR ( QPCR ) to establish the relative chromosomal and plasmid DNA contents . 
Approximately 10 ng total DNA , determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining , was used for each ampliﬁcation . 
A Lightcycler-Fast-StartDNA Master SYBR Green I kit ( Roche Diagnostics , Sant Cugat del Vallès , Spain ) was used for real-time PCR according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The oligonucleotides used were 5 TAC ACC TGC CAT CTG GCT GC 3 and 5 ATT ATA CTG GGC TTC TCC GG 3 for plasmid quantiﬁcation and 5 CTT ACA TTG CCA AAC AAC GTC AA AT 3 and 5 GAA AGC TCA AAC GCA TCT TCC AGT 3 for the chromosome . 
The concentration of oligonucleotides in every reaction was 1 M. Ampliﬁcations were performed in an iCycler ( BioRad Laboratories , Alcobendas , Spain ) and analyzed with iCycler IQ Software ( version 3.0 ) . 
The QPCR conditions were 600 s at 95 °C for enzyme activation and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C , 30 s at 50 °C , and 30 s at 72 °C . 
An additional step starting from 60 to 95 °C ( 0.5 °C / s ) was performed to establish the denaturation curve speciﬁc for each ampliﬁcation . 
The observation of a unique ﬂuorescence fall at the fusion temperature of each PCR product certiﬁed ampliﬁcation speciﬁcity . 
Fluorescence was measured at the end of each polymerization step ( excitation , 450 to 495 nm ; emission , 505 to 537 nm ) . 
Fluorescence versus the reaction cycle was plotted , and the PCR baseline and threshold cycles were automatically determined . 
Calibration curves were established for a concentration range from 0.6 ng to 12 ng of pSLT DNA . 
For this purpose , serial dilutions of plasmid DNA obtained with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep extraction kit ( QIAGEN-Izasa , Barce-lona , Spain ) were used as templates to determine QPCR calibration curves . 
Each point was replicated twice .

Site-directed mutagenesis of the ﬁnP promoter . 
A modiﬁed version of the procedure described previously ( 26 ) was used for site-directed mutagenesis of the ﬁnP promoter . 
A 326-bp fragment from pIZ899 was PCR ampliﬁed using the Universal and Reverse primers of pBluescript II SK ( ) as external primers . 
For the GATC3GATG substitution , the internal primers were 5 TTC TCA CGA TGC GTC GGA CAC AT 3 and 5 ATG TGT CCG ACG CAT CGT AGA GAA 3 . 
For the GATC3GCTC substitution , the internal primers were 5 TTC TCT ACG CTC CGT CGG ACA CAT 3 and 5 ATG TGT CCG ACG GAG CGT AGA GAA 3 . 
For the GATC3GGTC substitution , a 655-bp fragment from pIZ860 was ampliﬁed using the Universal and Reverse primers of pBluescript II SK ( ) as external primers and the oligonucleotides 5 TTC TCT ACG GTC CGT CGG ACA CAT 3 and 5 ATG TGT CCG ACG GAC CGT AGA GAA 3 as internal primers . 
The initial ampliﬁcation was carried out at a hybridization temperature of 54 °C . 
The ampliﬁcation products were puriﬁed , and 1 l of each product , previously diluted 1/10 , was used as a template for a second ampliﬁcation ( cycles 1 to 10 at 63 °C ; cycles 11 to 25 at 55 °C ) . 
In all cases , site-directed mutagenesis of the ﬁnP GATC destroyed a Sau3A restriction site ; the absence of this site was used to conﬁrm that the second ampliﬁcation had generated the product expected . 
The product was then cloned on pBluescript II SK ( ) and sequenced . 
Gel retardation assays with H-NS protein . 
Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously ( 34 ) . 
The DNA fragment used was a PCR ampliﬁcation product obtained with primers 5 AAG CAG CTC CAT GTC CAA G 3 and 5 GGT ATA GGA TCT CTC AGC C 3 . 
The template DNA was plasmid pIZ860 ( 59 ) . 
RESULTS
Lack of Dam does not alter pSLT copy number . 
A previous study showed that the pSLT plasmid undergoes higher frequencies of conjugal transfer from a Dam donor ( 5 ) . 
Because a well - known role of Dam methylation is the regulation of DNA replication , both in the bacterial chromosome and in certain plasmids ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that a dam mutation might alter the copy number of plasmid pSLT . 
If such were the case , the altered copy number might provide a simple explanation for the distinct donor abilities of Dam and Dam hosts . 
Fertility inhibition relies on tight regulation of the level of the TraJ protein , and any imbalance in the ratio of the ﬁnP and traJ transcripts can potentially increase TraJ synthesis and derepress conjugal transfer ( 18 ) . 
On these grounds , we compared the copy numbers of plasmid pSLT in Dam and Dam isogenic strains ( SV3000 and LT2 , respectively ) using a quan-titative-PCR protocol . 
Reverse and forward oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a 500-bp fragment adjacent to the chromosomal replication origin ( oriC ) and a 681-bp fragment containing the pSLT-borne ﬁnO gene . 
The DNA sizes of these fragments are in the range for SYBR Green detection according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The PCR efﬁciency ( E ) for each primer was calculated from ampliﬁcation slopes . 
They were found to be similar ( 0.44 log E 0.39 ) , allowing the comparison of results . 
Threshold cycles were normalized , indicating the relative copy number of pSLT per chromosome . 
Ampliﬁcations were performed in quadruplicate . 
The Dam strain SV3000 showed an average of 1.003 pSLT plasmids per oriC equivalent , with a standard deviation of 0.13 ( 13 % ) . 
The parental Dam strain showed an average of 1.02 plasmids per oriC equivalent , with a standard deviation of 0.204 ( 20 % ) . 
Thus , according to real-time PCR results , the Dam genetic background does not inﬂuence the pSLT copy number . 
Half-lives of pSLT-encoded FinP RNA in Dam and Dam hosts . 
Preliminary evidence that Dam methylation regulates ﬁnP transcription rather than FinP RNA stability or turnover had been provided by an earlier study ( 59 ) . 
A transcriptiona ﬁnP : : lac fusion constructed on a multicopy promoter-probe plasmid vector showed different activities in Dam and Dam hosts . 
Since the fusion contained only 28 bp of ﬁnP transcript , the possibility of postranscriptional regulation seemed unlikely ( 59 ) . 
Despite this evidence , we carried out a direct test to compare the half-lives of pSLT-encoded FinP RNA in Dam and Dam strains of S. enterica . 
Late-exponential cultures of strains SV4107 and SV4109 were prepared in minimal medium and treated with rifampin ( 250 g/liter ) to block transcription initiation . 
Samples for RNA analysis were periodically collected , immersed in liquid N2 , and centrifuged at 4 °C . 
Because Dam mutants contain smaller amounts of FinP RNA ( 59 ) , samples from the Dam strain contained 20 g of total RNA , while those from the Dam strain contained 60 g of total RNA . 
Electrophoretic separation in polyacrylamide gels was followed by Northern blot analysis . 
Larger amounts of FinP RNA were consistently found in the Dam strain , and densi-tometric analysis indicated that the difference was around two-to threefold ( data not shown ) . 
Since the RNA concentration was threefold higher in the samples from the Dam strain , the actual difference in FinP RNA content must be around six - to ninefold . 
No difference in FinP RNA decay was detected between the wild type and the Dam mutant , suggesting that Dam methylation does not regulate FinP RNA turnover ( Fig. 1 ) . 
A side observation was that pSLT-encoded FinP RNA appears to be long-lived , even in a Dam host . 
Because SV4107 and SV4109 both carry pSLT , the stability of FinP RNA may reﬂect the activity of the pSLT-encoded FinO product . 
Activity of a pSLT-borne ﬁnP : : lacZ fusion in Dam and Dam hosts . 
To rule out the possibility of an artifact related to the use of a high-copy-number vector , a ﬁnP : : lac fusion was constructed on pSLT itself , using a procedure described previously ( 14 ) . 
When the resulting fusion was tested in Dam and Dam backgrounds ( strains SV4762 and SV4764 ) , its - galactosidase activity proved to be signiﬁcantly higher in a Dam host : 178 39 Miller units compared to 44 9 Miller units in a Dam mutant ( average of ﬁve independent experiments ) . 
Aside from conﬁrming previous observations ( 5 , 59 ) , these experiments supported the view that higher ﬁnP expression in a Dam background reﬂected elevated activity of the ﬁnP promoter : in the ﬁnP : : lac fusion constructed , most of the ﬁnP transcript ( all but 3 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site ) had been eliminated . 
Thus , it seemed likely that the difference in the FinP RNA contents found in Dam and Dam hosts might reﬂect a difference in ﬁnP promoter activity . 
Identiﬁcation of the ﬁnP gene start site . 
Primer extension was used to map the 5 terminus of the ﬁnP transcript ( Fig. 2A ) . 
For this purpose , a strain of S. enterica carrying plasmid pIZ900 ( SV4107 ) was grown in minimal medium until late exponential phase ; total RNA was then prepared . 
For the extension reaction , a labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the ﬁnP coding sequence was used . 
The extension products were separated in a polyacrylamide gel containing 6 % urea . 
A sequencing reaction was run in parallel and used as a size marker ; DNA sequencing was primed by the same oligonucle-otide employed for primer extension . 
The ﬁnP transcript was found to start at the location predicted by sequence data ( 59 ) . 
Transcription of ﬁnP is 70 dependent . 
DNA sequence analysis in silico suggests that the ﬁnP gene may be transcribed from a canonical 70-dependent promoter that contains a GATC site overlapping with its 10 module ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In search of experimental evidence that might support 70 dependence , we tested the effect of a thermosensitive rpoD mutation on the expression of a ﬁnP : : lac fusion . 
For this purpose , plasmid pIZ880 was electroporated into the isogenic E. coli strains P90AE and UQ285 ( 28 ) . 
Overnight cultures grown at 30 °C in LB-ampicillin were used to start fresh cultures , which were grown at 30 °C ( permissive temperature ) and 42 °C ( restrictive temperature ) in LB-ampicillin . 
After 14 h of incubation , ali-quots were extracted and cooled down in ice ; - galactosidase activities were then measured . 
In an RpoD background , the activities of the ﬁnP : : lac fusion were similar at 42 °C and 30 °C . 
In the RpoD ( Ts ) strain , however , the activity of the ﬁnP : : lac fusion was 15-fold higher at 30 °C than at 42 °C ( Table 2 ) . 
These observations provide evidence that transcription of the ﬁnP gene requires the rpoD-encoded sigma factor , 70 . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the ﬁnP promoter . 
The presence of a GATC site in the ﬁnP promoter of pSLT suggested the possibility that the methylation state of the 10 module might directly regulate the ﬁnP promoter ( 59 ) . 
We also speculated that such a regulatory mechanism might be shared by other F-like plasmids , because the GATC site that overlaps the 10 module is also found in F and R100 ( 59 ) , and these plasmids , like pSLT , undergo derepression in a Dam background ( 7 , 59 ) . 
To examine this hypothesis , the GATC site present in the ﬁnP promoter was replaced with GATG ( plasmid pIZ922 ) , GCTC ( pIZ1515 ) , and GGTC ( pIZ1529 ) using a method described previously ( 26 ) . 
The effects of these changes on ﬁnP transcription were then analyzed in Dam ( SV3081 ) and Dam ( SV3083 ) hosts . 
A primer extension experiment using the GATG-containing ﬁnP promoter is shown in Fig. 2B . 
The GATC3GATG mutation did not alter the transcription start site , but the amounts of ﬁnP transcript detected in three independent experiments were consistently reduced in a Dam host . 
The GCTC mutation had similar effects ( data not shown ) . 
Hence , these experiments provided evidence that a GATC-less ﬁnP promoter was still regulated by Dam methylation . 
The GGTC mutation produced an inactive ﬁnP promoter ( data not shown ) . 
The latter observation is in agreement with data reported for other F-like plasmids ( 16 , 30 ) . 
The failure of GATC3GATG and GATC3GCTC mutations to make ﬁnP transcription Dam independent was further supported by their effects on the expression of a traJ : : lac translational fusion ( Table 3 ) . 
Neither mutation altered the expression pattern typical of the traJ : : lac fusion ( always higher in

We thus reached the unanticipated conclusion that the GATC located on the ﬁnP promoter was not involved in Dam-medi-ated regulation . 
A corollary was that Dam methylation regulated ﬁnP transcription in an indirect fashion via a trans-acting regulator , which was in turn regulated by Dam methylation . 
DNA regions upstream from the ﬁnP promoter are not required for Dam-mediated regulation . 
The possibility that a trans-acting factor might bind at or near the ﬁnP promoter led us to deﬁne potential upstream regulatory elements that might serve as targets for such regulation . 
For this purpose , deletions were generated on plasmid pIZ880 . 
The resulting plasmids were introduced into Dam and Dam isogenic strains 
( SV3081 and SV3083 , respectively ) . 
None of the deletions rendered ﬁnP transcription Dam independent ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Because the deletion generated with the DFP primer carried only 3 bp upstream from the 35 module , we concluded that no DNA sequence upstream from this module was necessary for Dam-mediated regulation of ﬁnP transcription , Hence , we hypothesized that a Dam-sensitive regulator of ﬁnP transcription might act at the promoter itself or downstream . 
Such sites of action are not uncommon among regulators of 70-dependent genes ( 27 ) .

Expression of the ﬁnP gene is not affected by SOS induction . 
Regulation of the ﬁnP gene by Dam methylation follows a pattern opposite to that of genes of the SOS regulon : expression of ﬁnP is lowered in a Dam host , while LexA-regulated genes show increased expression in a Dam background ( 36 , 44 , 58 ) . 
However , the evidence that ﬁnP transcription was regulated by Dam in an indirect fashion left open the possibility that an SOS-related regulator might control ﬁnP transcription . 
This possibility was examined in two kinds of experiments . 
( i ) The expression of a ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusion ( carried by strain SV4762 ) was examined in the presence of nali-dixic acid , a well known SOS-inducing agent . 
LB plates containing X-Gal were seeded with 107 cells of SV4762 ( which formed a lawn after growth ) . 
A small amount of nalidixic acid powder was placed in the center of each plate , and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C . 
As a control , the same test was carried out with TT10897 , a strain that contained an SOS-inducible cea : : lac fusion ( 44 ) . 
Blue ( Lac ) halos were clearly observed in the latter , but not with SV4762 . 
Hence , these experiments provided evidence that expression of the ﬁnP gene remained unaltered upon SOS induction . 
( ii ) The expression levels of the same ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusion were compared in LexA and LexA ( Ind ) backgrounds ( strains SV5017 and SV5019 , respectively ) . 
The LexA ( Ind ) background prevents SOS induction , because the LexA mutant protein is unable to undergo autodigestion upon RecA activation ( 56 ) . 
Dam-mediated regulation of ﬁnP was still observed in a LexA ( Ind ) background ( data not shown ) . 
Hence , we concluded that the Dam-sensitive regulator of ﬁnP transcription was not a product encoded by the SOS regulon . 
Effect of H-NS on ﬁnP and traJ transcription . 
A search for the Dam-sensitive regulator of ﬁnP transcription was carried out using previously described genetic screens ( 5 , 58 ) based on the detection of mutations that altered the expression of ﬁnP : : lac transcriptional fusions . 
One such screen revealed that a ﬁnP : : lac fusion , which is Lac in a Dam host and Lac in a Dam host , became Lac in a Dam Hns mutant , suggesting that the nucleoid protein H-NS repressed ﬁnP transcription in a Dam background . 
Because certain S. enterica hns mutations appeared to cause impaired growth if combined with a dam mutation ( data not shown ) , two well-characterized hns alleles were used : an hns : : Kmr insertion allele ( 15 ) and an hns : : Cmr allele constructed ad hoc by the method of Datsenko and Wanner ( 10 ) . 
Both alleles proved to be compatible with a dam mutation . 
The effect of hns gene disruption on ﬁnP transcription was assayed using two different ﬁnP : : lac constructs : ( i ) a ﬁnP : : lac fusion carried on pIZ880 , a multicopy plasmid introduced into strains SV3081 , SV3083 , SV5024 , and SV5025 ; ( ii ) a ﬁnP : : lac fusion constructed in pSLT itself ( strains SV4762 , SV4764 , SV5052 , and SV5053 ) . 
Both assays con-ﬁrmed that the decrease in ﬁnP transcription typical of Dam mutants was relieved in the presence of an hns mutation . 
In contrast , the effect of H-NS observed in a wild-type ( Dam ) background was very small , if any ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The ﬁnding that H-NS acted as a repressor of ﬁnP transcription in a Dam background raised the question of whether H-NS might likewise regulate traJ transcription . 
Furthermore , a recent study had shown that the sudden decrease in F transfer observed upon entry into stationary phase ( 21 ) is caused by H-NS-mediated repression of traJ transcription ( 61 ) . 
To compare traJ transcription in Dam and Dam hosts , the hns : : Kmr and hns : : Cmr alleles were used , and the assays were carried out in multicopy ( pIZ898 ) and single-copy ( pSLT ) traJ : : lac fusions . 
The host strains for the multicopy construct were SV3081 , SV3083 , SV5024 , and SV5025 , all lacking pSLT ; the singlecopy fusion was in turn introduced into SV4761 , SV4763 , SV5054 , and SV5055 . 
The results obtained in both series of experiments were similar and can be summarized as follows . 
( i ) In a wild-type background , expression of a traJ : : lac transcriptional fusion increased in the presence of an hns mutation , indicating that H-NS is a repressor of traJ ( Fig. 4 ) . 
H-NS-mediated repression was , however , partial and did not prevent traJ expression under any of the conditions tested ( see below ) . 
( ii ) Because Dam methylation represses traJ transcription ( 6 ) the effect of an hns mutation was also tested in a Dam background . 
Derepression of traJ expression by an hns mutation was detected in both Dam and Dam hosts ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Hence , unlike ﬁnP , the traJ gene is repressed by H-NS regardless of the Dam methylation state of the cell . 
( iii ) Increase of traJ expression in the presence of an hns mutation was also observed in a Lrp background . 
An lrp mutation caused a strong decrease in traJ transcription , as previously described ( 5 ) . 
However , the activity of a traJ : : lac transcriptional fusion was higher in an Lrp Hns mutant than in an Lrp mutant ( see Fig . 
S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
Hence , Lrp-medi-ated activation and H-NS-mediated repression of traJ transcription appear to be independent phenomena . 
Additional experiments indicated that H-NS-mediated repression of traJ transcription occurred in both exponential - and stationary-phase cultures ( see Fig . 
S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
This observation suggests that H-NS-mediated regulation of the pSLT traJ gene is different from that shown in F : while in the latter H-NS acts as a growth phase-dependent traJ repressor ( 61 ) , in pSLT it merely restrains traJ transcription . 
Such restraint is growth phase independent , a difference consistent with the ability of pSLT to undergo transfer from sta-tionary-phase cultures ( 5 ) ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
FIG. 3 . 
Effects of deletions upstream of the ﬁnP promoter on Dam-mediated regulation of ﬁnP transcription . 
The traJ : : lac fusion starting at the NaeI restriction site was carried on plasmid pIZ880 . 
Its deletion derivative starting at the EcoRV site was carried on pIZ955 , and the DFP-generated fusion was carried on pIZ981 . 
These plasmids were introduced into isogenic Dam and Dam strains that lacked pSLT ( SV3081 and SV3083 , respectively ) . 
The activities ( in tens of Miller units ) of the fusions were measured in both backgrounds ( Dam , white bars ; Dam , black bars ) . 
The data shown are the means and standard deviations of six independent experiments . 
Analysis of H-NS binding to the traJ-ﬁnP region of the Salmonella virulence plasmid . 
In the F sex factor , HN-S has been shown to bind a DNA stretch that encompasses the traJ-ﬁnP region ( 61 ) . 
To analyze whether H-NS was likewise able to bind the homologous traJ-ﬁnP region in plasmid pSLT , a 589-bp fragment of pIZ860 was PCR ampliﬁed . 
This fragment contained 218 bp upstream of the traJ start site and 236 bp upstream of the ﬁnP start site ( shown in the diagram in Fig. 5 , top ) . 
H-NS binding was assayed in the presence of competitor DNA : a 427-bp fragment from the E. coli hemolysin operon previously shown to lack speciﬁcity for H-NS binding ( 34 ) . 
Preferential retardation of the DNA fragment that contained the pSLT traJ-ﬁnP region was clearly observed as the H-NS concentration increased . 
Therefore , the ability of H-NS to restrain traJ transcription may be tentatively correlated with its ability to bind the traJ-ﬁnP region of plasmid pSLT . 
These observations , however , also raise an intriguing question : if the region bound by H-NS includes the ﬁnP promoter , why is the latter repressed by H-NS in a Dam background only ? 
As discussed below , this effect can not be explained by a local effect of Dam methylation on H-NS binding , because the only GATC site found in the region is dispensable for Dam-mediated regulation ( Table 3 ) .

DISCUSSION
Genes whose expression is affected by Dam methylation have been described in both E. coli and S. enterica ( 32 , 36 ) . 
Such Dam-regulated genes were often discovered in genetic or microarray screens that compared gene expression in Dam and Dam isogenic strains ( 31 , 42 , 58 ) . 
It must be noted , however , that a difference in gene expression between Dam and Dam hosts does not imply a direct involvement of Dam methylation in gene regulation . 
For instance , in both E. coli and Salmonella , genes of the SOS regulon show increased expression in a Dam background ( 36 , 44 , 58 ) . 
The effect is , however , indirect : in the absence of Dam-directed strain discrimination , the mismatch repair MutHLS complex produces double-strand DNA breaks , and SOS induction occurs ( 22 ) . 
The example of the SOS gene network is unlikely to be unique , given the enormous differences found in the proteomes o

The host strains used were SV4762 ( Dam Hns ) , SV4764 ( Dam Hns ) , SV5052 ( Dam Hns ) , and SV5053 ( Dam Hns ) . 
The data shown are the means and standard deviations of four independent experiments . 
Dam and Dam strains ( 42 ) and the smaller number of genes that appear to be directly regulated by Dam methylation ( 31 , 42 ) . 
Aside from this caveat , examples of genes whose transcription is regulated by the methylation state of critical GATC sites have been known for two decades and can be classiﬁed into two classes . 
( i ) The ﬁrst class contains genes whose expression is coupled to the cell cycle , such as the IS10 transposase gene ( 45 ) and the E. coli trpR gene ( 35 ) . 
Promoters of this class contain GATC sites whose methylation states regulate RNA polymerase binding . 
( ii ) The second class comprises genes that contain GATC sites in upstream regulatory regions . 
In such cases , the methylation state of one or more GATC sites regulates binding of speciﬁc transcription factors . 
Examples of this class are the papBA promoter of uropathogenic E. coli ( 25 ) , the mom promoter of phage Mu ( 3 ) , the Ag43 promoter of E. coli ( 24 ) , and the traJ gene of the Salmonella virulence plasmid ( 6 ) . 
Here , we describe a case of transcriptional regulation by Dam methylation that does not ﬁt in these two classes . 
The ﬁnP gene of the Salmonella virulence plasmid is transcribed at higher levels in a Dam background . 
However , Dam-mediated regulation of ﬁnP transcription does not require the presence of GATC sites at or near the promoter : in fact , a mutant ﬁnP promoter devoid of the GATC site that overlaps its 10 module is still regulated by Dam . 
Hence , Dam methylation regulates ﬁnP transcription in an indirect fashion , a trait that is reminiscent of the LexA-regulated SOS gene network . 
Unlike SOS genes , however , ﬁnP transcription is not regulated by DNA damage and remains unaltered in a LexA ( Ind ) background . 
On these grounds , we postulated that ﬁnP was regulated by an unknown , Dam-sensitive , trans-acting factor ( either a positive effector of transcription active in a Dam background or a negative effector active in a Dam background ) . 
Trials for the Dam-sensitive ﬁnP regulator identiﬁed H-NS as a repressor of ﬁnP transcription . 
H-NS is a nucleoid-asso-ciated protein that participates in the organization of bacterial chromatin and usually acts as a repressor of gene expression ( 13 ) . 
At the ﬁnP promoter , however , repression by H-NS is observed only in a Dam background . 
This difference can not be explained by a direct effect of Dam methylation upon H-NS binding , because Dam-mediated repression is still observed in a GATC-less ﬁnP promoter . 
The involvement of upstream DNA sequences is likewise ruled out by deletion analysis . 
Hence , H-NS-mediated repression of ﬁnP must reﬂect a condition or state that occurs in Dam mutants but not in the wild type . 
For instance , a tentative explanation may be that a higher H-NS concentration exists in Salmonella Dam mutants , as reported in E. coli ( 42 ) . 
Although no evidence exists that the H-NS level in the cell is directly regulated by Dam methylation , one speculation may be that higher H-NS content is required to compensate for nucleoid distortions caused by lack of aden-osine methylation . 
N6 methylation at individual GATC sites is known to inﬂuence local DNA structure ( 12 , 43 ) , and the cumulative effect of nonmethylation at the 20,000 GATC sites present in the genome might have a major impact on nucleoid topology . 
In the F sex factor , H-NS has been shown to silence traJ and traM expression during entry into stationary phase ( 61 ) . 
Binding of H-NS to a region that encompasses the traM and traJ promoters suggests that silencing is a regional effect ( 61 ) . 
In pSLT , H-NS is also a repressor of traJ transcription , but repression is only partial and does not increase in stationary-phase cultures . 
This difference is consistent with the observation that transfer of the Salmonella virulence plasmid is largely insensitive to the growth stage . 
It must be noted that F-like plasmids share a general regulatory design , but individual regulatory traits are also found . 
An example concerns H-NS , identiﬁed here as a repressor of mating as previously shown for F ( 61 ) but described instead as an activator of mating functions in pRK100 ( 54 ) . 
Another example involves the leucine-respon-sive regulatory protein , which is an activator of traJ transcription in the Salmonella virulence plasmid ( 5 ) but not in pRK100 ( 54 ) . 
Plasmid-speciﬁc regulatory features may reﬂect distinct responses to physiological and environmental signals , and perhaps distinct strategies for plasmid spread in bacterial populations . 
An enigmatic aspect of mating regulation in the Salmonella virulence plasmid is that H-NS-mediated restraint of traJ transcription is insensitive to Dam methylation , while the overlapping ﬁnP gene escapes H-NS-mediated repression in a wildtype ( Dam ) background . 
From a mechanistic point of view , this difference is intriguing , since a large DNA stretch that includes both traJ and ﬁnP appears to be bound by H-NS , as previously described for F ( 61 ) . 
However , the ﬁnP and traJ promoters are transcribed in opposite directions , thus raising the possibility that H-NS repression might be strand speciﬁc . 
On the other hand , H-NS is known to bind curved DNA ( 13 ) , and curvature in the traJ-ﬁnP region might have distinct effects on promoters lying on opposite strands . 
Aside from these speculations , the avoidance of H-NS-mediated silencing at the ﬁnP gene certainly ﬁts in the logic of fertility inhibition : repression of traJ , but not of ﬁnP , can be viewed as a coordinated action for the repression of conjugal plasmid transfer . 
Mating restraint mechanisms , no matter how odd or subtle , can be expected to have a high adaptive value to avoid the burden that overexpression of mating functions would otherwise impose on the host cell ( 63 ) .
