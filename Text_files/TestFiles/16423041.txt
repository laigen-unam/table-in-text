Summary 
Upon antigen contact in the presence of cognate T-cell help , naive B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells . 
During this process , which occurs in germinal centres , B cells undergo afﬁnity maturation and class-switch recombination , giving rise to different subclasses of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) memory B cells , depending on the cytokine environment . 
Fol-1 ,2 lowing re-exposure to the same antigen , memory B cells undergo rapid proliferation , culminating in differentiation into plasma cells and in the secretion of high-afﬁnity IgG , which might persist in the circulation for years , thus providing long-term antibody production . 
However , 1,3 because the half-life of serum IgG is < 3 weeks , continu-4 ous antibody production is necessary to sustain IgG antibody titres for long-term antibody-mediated immunity . 
Thus , memory B-cell differentiation into short-lived or long-lived plasma cells represents an important source of protective antibodies for long-term immunity . 
3,5,6 Although some studies have demonstrated that high systemic antibody titres measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) correlate with immunity against pathogens , efﬁcient B-cell memory and protection depend critically on the bactericidal or neutralizing activity of these antibodies . 
This long-term production of 3,5,7 bactericidal -- neutralizing antibody constitutes a hallmark of adaptive immunity and is the basis of most effective vaccines . 
The mechanisms proposed to explain the long-lasting persistence of antibody titres include the following four explanations . 
( 1 ) The existence of long-lived memory B cells that survive in the absence of the speciﬁc antigen , and which clonally expand to increase the number of antigen-speciﬁc cells available for another encounter with their speciﬁc antigens . 
After antigen re-exposure , these cells require less activation than naive B cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells . 
During the recall response , the host is able to respond faster , with higher antibody titres , to the speciﬁc antigen . 
( 2 ) Long-lived 1 antibody-producing plasma cells survive in the bone marrow for long periods , maintaining high protective antibody titres for a long time in the absence of speciﬁc antigen . 
( 3 ) An independent antigenic stimulation via 8,9 polyclonal or bystander activation maintains memory B cells and provides a continuous source of new plasma cells . 
( 4 ) An antigen-dependent mechanism , in which 10 the persisting antigen is retained on follicular dendritic cells in germinal centres and maintains the speciﬁc switched B cells or memory B cells differentiated into short-lived plasma cells . 
Any or all of these non-5 ,11 -- 13 exclusive mechanisms could be responsible for maintain ¬ 
We examined the ability of porins from Salmonella enterica serovar typhi to induce a long-term antibody response in BALB/c mice . 
These porins triggered a strong lifelong production of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody in the absence of exogenous adjuvant . 
Analysis of the IgG subclasses 
produced during this antibody response revealed the presence of the subclasses IgG2b , IgG1 , IgG2a and weak IgG3 .

bactericidal-binding activity to the wild-type S. typhi strain , whereas porin-speciﬁc antibody titres measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) decreased with time . 
Because our porin preparations contained the outer membrane proteins C and F ( OmpC and OmpF ) , we 
evaluated the individual contribution of each porin to the long-lasting antibody response . 
OmpC and OmpF induced long-lasting antibody titres , measured by ELISA , which were sustained for 300 days .

Introduction 
ing the memory B-cell response . 
Long-term , high-afﬁnity protective antibodies are maintained following infection or immunization . 
However , 3,7 only a few puriﬁed antigens have been studied and found to induce a long-lasting , persisting antibody response in the absence of adjuvants . 
For this reason , the characteri-7 zation of novel antigens with the ability to induce a neut-ralizing or bactericidal antibody memory response constitutes an important endeavour in understanding protective immunological memory . 
Antibody responses are important to achieve protection against salmonella infection . 
We have previously reported that heat-inactivated sera speciﬁc for Salmonella enterica serovar typhi ( hereafter referred as S. typhi ) outer membrane proteins protected mice against challenge with 50 and 100 lethal doses of the virulent bacteria . 
In humans , 14 high antibody titres speciﬁc to S. typhi surface antigens such as Vi polysaccharide correlate with protection against infection . 
These studies portray the anti-15 body response as essential to achieving protection against S. typhi . 
In mice , the contribution of the anti-body-mediated immune response during salmonella infection has been studied in B-cell-deﬁcient animals . 
16 -- 18 These experiments established that protective immunity to S. typhimurium depends on the combined action of speciﬁc antibodies , B cells and T-cell-acquired immune responses . 
In addition , antibodies to lipopolysaccha-16 -- 18 ride ( LPS ) O-chains , porin -- LPS complexes and , to a les-ser degree , native porins are important in acquired resistance to infection by S. typhimurium . 
19 Because of the ability of porins to elicit a host immune response and thus protection of the host against infection , our group and others have studied porins from S. typhi as candidates for a vaccine against typhoid fever , a 20,21 life-threatening systemic disease that remains an import-ant health problem in some developing countries . 
With 22 up to 10 molecules per cell , porins are the most abun-5 dant proteins found in the outer membrane of Gram-neg-ative bacteria ; porins assemble in trimers and form stable pores that allow the passive transport of nutrients . 
The 23 ﬁrst evidence of the immunogenicity of porins was that the serum of patients in the acute and convalescent phases of typhoid fever induced IgM and IgG antibodies that recognize mainly these proteins . 
Moreover , 24 -- 26 porins from several pathogens have been described as activators of the innate and adaptive immune responses . 
These proteins are agonists for Toll-like 27,28 receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) and induce the expression of costimulatory molecules , up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules , cytokine release by macrophages , and increased antibody production by B cells . 
Immunization with puriﬁed porins can pro-29 -- 31 tect mice against challenge with virulent salmonella strains . 
During the host immune response , S. typhi 32 -- 36 porins induce T-cell and antiporin antibodies . 
20,37 -- 41 Previous studies have demonstrated that salmonella porins induce the production of predominantly IgG1 after 30 days in BALB/c mice . 
We have recently reported that 42 human volunteers vaccinated with S. typhi porins produced bactericidal IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies 2 weeks after immunization . 
These studies have demonstrated that po-20 rins are good immunogens . 
Because the ability of S. typhi porins to induce a B-cell memory response has not been analysed and bactericidal -- neutralizing antibodies are essential for protective B-cell memory , we were interested in studying the capacity of porins to induce a long-term 
We report that immunization of mice with S. typhi porins induces a bactericidal antibody response for life . 
Despite the high homology among porins of different sal-monella strains , the long-lasting antiporin sera did not cross-react with S. typhimurium , suggesting that the selection of bactericidal antibodies is directed at unshared exposed epitopes . 
Analysis of the speciﬁc antibody response against OmpC and OmpF porins showed that OmpC is the main component of porins responsible for the antibody-mediated memory bactericidal response . 
bactericidal antibody response . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
The wild-type S. typhi strain was obtained from ATCC 9993 . 
Isogenic Salmonella mutant strains STYF302 D R D R ( ompF Km ) and STYC171 ( ompC Km ) expressing OmpC and OmpF , respectively , have been previously des-cribed . 
The isogenic mutant strain VALE39 ( 43 DompF R D R Km ompC Cm ) , deﬁcient in both the OmpF and OmpC porins , was generated for this study . 
To evaluate cross-reactivity , an Escherichia coli strain was isolated from mouse faeces and characterized biochemically . 
Immunogens
The salmonella porins ( i.e. OmpC and OmpF ) were puri-20 ﬁed from the wild-type S. typhi as previously described . 
-- Salmonella typhi strains STYF302 ( OmpF ) and STYC171 -- ( OmpC ) were used as the source of OmpC and OmpF porins , respectively . 
LPS content was determined by means of the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay ( LAL ) ( Endosafe KTA , Charles River Endosafe Laboratories , Charleston SC ) . 
LPS-free ovalbumin ( OVA ) Grade VI was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. , St Louis MO. . 
Protein-free S. typhi LPS was kindly provided by Dr John 
S. Gunn, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.
Mice
Female BALB/c or C3H/HeJ LPS-hyporesponsive mice , 8 -- 10 weeks old , were used and kept in the animal facilities of the Experimental Medicine Department , Faculty of Medicine , National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) , and cared for in conformity with good laborat-ory practice guidelines . 
Immunizations
Groups of mice ( three or six mice/group ) were immun-ized intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) on day 0 and boosted on day 15 with 10 lg of native antigen preparations : porins , OmpC , OmpF . 
Antigens were diluted in sterile isotonic saline solution ( saline ) to a total volume of 0 5 ml . 
No added adjuvant was used for these immunizations . 
Control mice were injected with saline only . 
Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital sinus at various times as indicated in each ﬁgure . 
Individual serum samples were stored at ) 20 until analysis . 
Determination of antibody titres by ELISA
IgM and IgG antibodies . 
High-binding 96-well polystyrene plates ( Corning , New York NY ) were coated with 10 lg/ml of porins , OmpC , OmpF , or LPS and 150 lg/ml for experiments using OVA in 0 1 M carbonate -- bicarbonate buffer , pH 9 5 . 
Plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37 and then overnight at 4 . 
Before use , plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 2 ) containing 0 05 % Tween-20 ( PBS-T ) ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) . 
Non-speciﬁc binding was blocked with 5 % non-fat dry milk diluted in PBS ( PBS-M ) for 2 hr at 37 . 
After washing , mice sera were diluted 1 : 40 in PBS-M and two-fold serial dilutions were added to the wells . 
Plates were incubated for 2 hr at 37 , followed by six washes with PBS-T . 
The optimal dilution , 1000 : 1 , of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM or IgG antibodies ( Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) was added , followed by 1 hr of incubation at 37 and eight additional washes with PBS-T . 
IgG subclasses . 
Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b ( Zymed ) or IgG3 ( Rockland , Gilberts-ville , PA ) antibodies were used to titrate the speciﬁc subclasses . 
All conjugates were used at 1 : 1000 dilution in PBS-M and incubated for 1 hr at 37 , followed by eight washes with PBS-T . 
Ortho-phenylenediamine ( 0 5 mg/ml ; Sigma ) in 0 1 M citrate buffer , pH 5 6 , containing 30 % H O was used as the enzyme substrate . 
The reaction was 2 2 stopped with 1 25 M H SO and the optical densities were 2 4 read at 490 nm using an automatic ELISA plate reader 
( Dynex Technologies MRII , Chantilly , VA ) with BIOLINX 2 22 software . 
Antibody titres are given as -- log2 dilution · 40 . 
Positive titres were deﬁned as 3 SD above the mean values of the negative controls . 
In the graphs , symbols indicate the mean ± SD of three to six mice per group . 
Flow cytometry
The ability of antiporin , antiOmpC and antiOmpF sera to bind to live bacteria was evaluated using the wild-type S. typhi strains , ATCC 9993 and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 , and commensal E. coli . 
We used a previously reported method with minor modiﬁcations . 
Bacteria 44 were washed with PBS and diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 cells/ml . 
Preimmune or hyperimmune sera , 9 1 : 100 , were incubated with 10 bacteria for 60 min at 8 37 . 
Cells were washed and incubated with goat ﬂuoresc-ein-labelled anti-mouse IgG , 1 : 200 ( Immunotech , Mar-sella , France ) for 30 min at 37 . 
Analyses were performed on a FACScan ﬂow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Frank-lin Lakes , NJ ) using the CELL QUEST Software ( version 3 2.1 ) . 
Acquisition gates were set on forward-scatter and side-scatter modes to exclude lysed cells and cell aggregates . 
Ten thousand cells were analysed for each sample . 
Complement-mediated bactericidal assay
Serum bactericidal activity was determined using a previously described method with minor modiﬁcations . 
45 Brieﬂy , antiporin , antiOmpC and antiOmpF sera were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 . 
Sterile U-bottomed 96-well polystyrene microtitre plates ( Corning ) were used for the bactericidal assay . 
Duplicates of complement-inactivated sera were prediluted 1 : 40 in PBS , and two-fold serial dilutions were added to wells containing 200 ± 50 colony-forming units ( CFU ) of the wild-type S. typhi or the isogenic VALE39 strain , and a complement source ( guinea-pig serum ) 9 % ( v/v ) . 
Controls included samples containing : ( 1 ) a known positive sample ; ( 2 ) bacteria and complement-inactivated antiporin sera ; ( 3 ) bacteria and guinea-pig serum ; and ( 4 ) bacteria , antiporin sera , and heat-inactivated guinea-pig serum . 
Plates were incubated for 18 hr at 37 and the CFU were counted . 
Bactericidal titres are given as -- log2 dilution · 40 , and represent the lowest dilution at which 50 % killing of bacteria was observed . 
Statistical analysis
The Mann -- Whitney U-test was used to compare antibody titres between the experimental groups . 
Results
Porins induce a strong lifelong antibody response
In a previous study , we reported that 10 lg of native porins confer strong active protection in mice . 
Thus , to 33 evaluate the time span of the antibody response induced by porins , BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 lg of native porins on day 0 and an identical booster dose was given on day 15 . 
These antigens were diluted in saline as a vehicle , and injected i.p. in the absence of added adjuvant . 
During the primary antibody responses , an early 
16-fold elevation of IgM and IgG antibody titres was observed on day 4 ( Fig. 1a ) . 
After boosting ( i.e. during the secondary response ) , the highest antibody titres were seen around day 30 , with a 1024-fold increase in IgG titre over control values ( Fig. 1a ) . 
On day 90 , IgG titres had decreased to half their maximal values , and continued to decrease slowly to reach levels similar to those at day 4 . 
The antibody titres remained 16 times the control levels until the last mouse died of apparently natural causes 476 days after the ﬁrst immunization ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Although 
To examine whether the route of administration inﬂu-enced the antibody response , BALB/c mice were immun-ized intravenously ( i.v. ) and subcutaneously ( s.c. ) . 
The kinetics of the antibody titres were similar in these groups to those in animals immunized i.p. ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicate that porins induce a lifelong antibody memory response in the absence of exogenous adjuvants , regardless of the route of immunization . 
Porins induce a lifelong bactericidal antibody memory response
Because efﬁcient B-cell memory depends on the concerted capacity of antibodies to achieve bactericidal or neutralizing activity , we used a complement-dependent bactericidal assay to examine whether antiporin antibodies could mediate S. typhi bacteriolysis . 
Although a weak bactericidal response was observed on day 4 after immunization , by day 10 , the bactericidal titres had rapidly increased to 128 times the control level ( Fig. 1b ) . 
During the secon-dary response , bactericidal activity showed a 512-fold increase on day 25 , and remained at this level until day 
476 , even though the ELISA antibody titres markedly decreased after day 150 ( Fig. 1b ) . 
The bactericidal activity of these sera was directed against porins , because sera from immunized mice failed to induce bacteriolysis of a porin-deﬁcient S. typhi strain ( OmpC OmpF ) ( Fig. 1b ) . 
-- -- The capacity of antibodies to recognize bacteria is essential for the induction of a bacteriolytic response . 
We next compared the antibody-binding capacities of sera ( i.e. the ability of antibodies to recognize live bacteria ) . 
Antiporin IgG antibodies obtained from mice during the primary ( day 4 ) , secondary ( day 25 ) , and long-lasting ( day 300 ) responses were analysed by ﬂow cytometry . 
We found low reactivity at day 4 , but speciﬁc binding on days 25 and 300 ( Fig. 2a ) . 
In contrast , we observed no binding to S. typhi ( OmpC OmpF ; data -- -- not shown ) . 
Taken together , these data indicate that the low memory antiporin antibody titres measured by ELISA were as efﬁcient in killing and binding to bacteria as the high antiporin antibody titres observed during the secondary response . 
Anti-S. typhi porin antibodies are species-speciﬁc
Because porins are conserved proteins among different salmonella strains , we next asked whether long-lasting 46 antiporin antibodies could cross-react with other related bacterial porins . 
Using ﬂow cytometry , we evaluated the capacity of these antibodies to recognize surface-exposed epitopes on the bacteria . 
Day 300 antiporin IgG sera were incubated with S. typhimurium and commensal E. coli . 
Antiporin IgG antibodies did not bind to S. typhimu-rium , but exhibited a low cross-reactivity with E. coli ( Fig. 2d ) . 
These results agree with previous ﬁndings that monoclonal antibodies directed to surface-exposed epitopes of porins are not cross-reactive , whereas antiporin antibodies toward buried regions present high cross-reac-tivity . 
Overall , our data suggest that memory antiporin 47 antibodies recognized speciﬁc S. typhi B-cell epitopes not shared between different bacterial strains . 
were lower , a long-lasting IgM ith a four-fold elevation at day 
the IgM antibody titres response was observed , w 476 ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Porin-speciﬁc antibodies are composed of all IgG subclasses
To characterize the porin-speciﬁc IgG response , we identiﬁed the IgG subclass composition in the antiporin sera . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( c ) , the IgG3 response was rapid at day 4 , followed by the IgG subclasses : IgG2b , IgG1 and IgG2a at days 8 -- 14 . 
We observed different IgG subclass antibody titres ( IgG2b , IgG1 , IgG3 and IgG2a ) during the secon-dary response ( Fig. 1c ) . 
During the long-lasting antibody response , the IgG subclass titre proﬁle included IgG2b , IgG1 , IgG2a and weak IgG3 ( Fig. 1c ) . 
Because IgG1 is a poor complement-activating subclass , these results 48 suggest that IgG2b and IgG2a are the main contributors to the long-lasting bactericidal memory response . 
Moreover , the presence of all IgG subclasses shows the strong immunogenicity of porins and suggests that additional protective biological activities are mediated by the non-bactericidal IgG subclasses . 
LPS traces in the porin preparations are unlikely to account fully for the induction of lifelong bactericidal antibody memory responses
Porins form tight complexes with LPS . 
We estimated 49 that the LPS content in the porin preparations , determined by the LAL assay , was 0 02 % ( wt/wt ) , equivalent to 0 2 ng of LPS/lg of protein . 
We examined if such a low level of LPS contamination might play a role in the long-lasting bactericidal antibody memory response through three parallel approaches , which produced the following results . 
First , antiporin sera from BALB/c mice ( Fig. 1 ) were analysed by ELISA to detect anti-LPS antibody titres .

The lifelong bactericidal antibody memory response induced by porins . 
BALB/c mice were immunized i.p. with 10 lg of porins at day 0 and 15 ( marked with an arrow ) . 
( a ) ELISA antibody titres . 
Antiporin IgM ( e ) , antiporin IgG ( r ) , and saline immunized controls ( h ) . 
( b ) Bactericidal antibody response . 
Sera from experimental groups were pooled and the bactericidal effect was analysed against wild-type S. typhi ( r ) and S. typhi ( OmpC OmpF ) ( -- -- · ) ; saline immunized controls ( h ) . 
( c ) The antiporin IgG subclasses IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b , and IgG3 ( r ) ; 
saline immunized controls ( h ) . 
The antibody response was evaluated in each mouse for 476 days after immunization until the last mouse died . 
Results are expressed as the mean ± SD , with three mice per group ( a and c ) . 
Data correspond to one representative result from ﬁve independent 
experiments . 
Anti-LPS IgM antibody titres increased by about fourfold , but this response was no longer seen after day 40 postimmunization ( Fig. 3a ) , and background anti-LPS IgG titres were detected only after day 19 ( Fig. 3a ) . 
However , these anti-LPS antibodies were unable to lyse S. typhi ( OmpC OmpF ) ( Fig. 1b and data not shown ) , -- -- indicating that these antibodies do not play a role in the observed bactericidal activity . 
Second , because C3H/HeJ mice posses a missense mutation in the tlr4 gene and are hyporesponsive to LPS , they provide a useful model to 50 evaluate whether possible LPS contamination induced the bactericidal memory response . 
Figure 3 ( b ) shows that C3H/HeJ mice produced a rapid antiporin IgG antibody response at day 4 , which peaked on day 22 with a 256-fold increase , and which remained elevated 32-fold above control levels throughout the lifetime . 
These antibodies also exhibited bactericidal activity , with a 128-fold increase at day 22 , which remained unchanged until day 390 , even though ELISA titres decreased over time ( Fig. 3c ) . 
In addition , IgG1 , IgG2a and IgG2b antiporin subclasses were observed during this long-term memory bactericidal response in C3H/HeJ mice . 
Notably , we found IgG2a and IgG2b until the last mice died on day 390 postimmunization , supporting the role of both subclasses in the long-lasting bactericidal activity ( Fig. 3d ) . 
In contrast to BALB/c mice , in C3H/HeJ mice , anti-LPS IgM and IgG antibody titres were barely detected ( 1 to 2 ± 1 log titres ) on day 12 after porin immunization ( data not shown ) . 
Third , we studied the adjuvant effect induced by 0 2 ng of S. typhi LPS/lg of protein using the model antigen 
OVA . 
Groups of six BALB/c mice were immunized i.p. on day 0 with 10 lg OVA , 10 lg OVA + 2 ng LPS , 10 lg OVA + 5 lg LPS , or saline . 
Mice were boosted on day 15 using the same antigen composition and dose . 
Speciﬁc antibody titres in sera from immunized animals were measured by ELISA . 
The Mann -- Whitney U-test was used to compare the groups . 
OVA induced only 2 ± 1 log speciﬁc IgG1 antibody titres on day 12 after immunization , and the antibody titres increased 4 ± 2-fold on day 5 after boosting ( day 20 ) . 
Antibody titres did not increase signiﬁcantly in animals immunized with 10 lg

OVA + 2 ng LPS ( P > 0 05 ) and antibody titres of other IgG antibody subclasses such as IgG2a , IgG2b ( 1 ± 1 log titre ) and IgG3 were not detected ( data not shown ) . 
In contrast , the antibody titre increased 64-fold in mice immunized with 10 lg OVA + 5 lg LPS on day 12 and 512-fold on day 20 . 
The IgG2b antibody titres increased 16-fold on day 20 , whereas IgG2a and IgG3 antibody titres were not detected ( data not shown ) . 
The experiment was repeated to conﬁrm these results . 
Because OVA is a poor immunogenic protein compared with porins , the OVA dose -- response experiment was performed to determine the optimal OVA dose to be used for control experiments . 
Groups of ﬁve BALB/c mice were immun-ized i.p. with 10 lg , 100 lg , 1 mg , 2 mg or 5 mg OVA . 
Blood from immunized animals was collected for 30 days and OVA-speciﬁc antibody titres were measured in sera using ELISA . 
The optimal dose -- response was observed in mice immunized with 2 mg OVA ( data not shown ) . 
Two milligrams of OVA was then used for immunizations . 
OVA induced a 64-fold increase in IgG1 antibody titre on days 12 and 20 compared with that induced by 10 lg OVA . 
Two milligrams of OVA also induced a 16-fold increase in IgG2b antibody titre but only on day 20 , whereas no IgG2a or IgG3 antibody titres were detected . 
A similar pattern of antibody titres and curve kinetics was observed when mice were immunized with 2 mg 
OVA + 2 ng LPS . 
In contrast , mice immunized with 2 mg OVA + 5 lg LPS exhibited a 128-fold increase in speciﬁc IgG2b titres and 8-fold to 32-fold increases in OVA-speciﬁc IgG2a antibody titres , showing the adjuvant effect of 5 lg LPS ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicate that traces of LPS present in porin preparations do not signiﬁcantly contribute to the high speciﬁc antibody titres or to the high IgG subclass titres induced by porins . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the small amount of LPS contamination detected in the porin prep-arations is unlikely to account fully for the induction of the long-lasting antibody memory response . 
OmpC is the main porin responsible for the antibody-mediated memory bactericidal response
Porins puriﬁed from wild type S. typhi consist of a mixture of OmpC and OmpF porins . 
To evaluate the 20,33 contribution of independently isolated OmpC or OmpF porins in the antibody memory response , we puriﬁed each protein from either OmpF or OmpC salmonella-deﬁcient strains ( data not shown ) . 
During the primary and long-lasting responses , OmpC induced a stronger production of IgG antibody than OmpF ( Fig. 4a ) . 
The initial IgG3 production observed with porin immunization ( Fig. 1c ) was induced by the OmpC porin , which presented an eight-fold elevation on day 4 ( Fig. 4c ) . 
After boosting , whereas antiOmpC IgG titres reached maximum titres with a 1024-fold increase above control levels on day 25 , the greatest response of antiOmpF titres occurred on day 31 , with a 512-fold elevation ( Fig. 4a ) . 
During this secondary response , both porins showed a similar pattern of production of IgG subclasses : IgG2b , IgG1 , IgG3 and IgG2a ( Fig. 4c ) . 
Notably , whereas anti-OmpC IgG titres remained unchanged until day 300 ( the last point tested ) with a 256-fold increase , antiOmpF IgG titres decreased to a level that was 16-fold above the control level at day 300 ( Fig. 4a ) . 
The long-lasting antiOmpC IgG subclass proﬁle changed to a gradual decrease of IgG3 compared with the other subclasses : IgG1 , IgG2b , IgG2a and weak IgG3 at day 300 ( Fig. 4c ) . 
The presence of high bactericidal antibody titres con-ﬁrmed that OmpC had the strongest immunogenicity . 
AntiOmpC and antiOmpF antibodies reached their maximum bactericidal titres during the secondary response ( Fig. 4b ) . 
AntiOmpC bactericidal titres exhibited a 256-fold increase , whereas antiOmpF bactericidal titres were elevated only 16-fold above control levels ( Fig. 4b ) . 
Moreover , the strong bactericidal response induced by OmpC was sustained at a level 64 times the control level at day 300 , the last point tested ( Fig. 4b ) . 
In contrast , the bactericidal activity induced by OmpF decreased to a level only twice that of the control level at day 90 , and was no longer detected at day 180 , even though the ELISA showed antiOmpF IgG antibody titres ( Figs 4a -- c ) . 
Consistent with these data , antiOmpC antibodies still bound S. typhi at all the time points studied . 
The antiOmpC IgG primary response showed a weak recognition on day 4 , which increased to its highest capacity at day 25 and was still present at day 300 ( Fig. 2b ) . 
This pattern contrasted with the observation that antiOmpF IgG antibodies bound S. typhi only at day 25 , and then decreased below the detection limit after day 180 ( Fig. 2c ) . 
These results suggest that OmpC induced a persistent bactericidal-binding antibody memory response , whereas the long-lasting antiOmpF antibodies recognized B-cell epitopes not exposed on the bacterial surface .

Discussion
Maintaining the production of bactericidal and neutralizing antibodies over time is essential to achieve an efﬁcient protective B-cell memory response . 
Long-term protective antibodies are apparent after vaccination with live-attenuated micro-organisms ( e.g. smallpox , polio-virus , or rubella ) or by the application of several booster doses of subunit antigens ( e.g. tetanus toxoid or hepatitis B surface antigen ) . 
Because micro-organisms contain a 7,51 mosaic of antigens , the elicited memory immune response is complex . 
Thus , characterizing antigens that can sustain the production of long-term protective antibodies would help identify and explain the mechanisms responsible for the induction of immunological memory . 
We found that immunization with S. typhi porins in mice induced a sustained lifelong bactericidal/binding antibody response , even in the absence of added adjuvants ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . 
Notably , these antiporin antibodies did not cross-react with S. typhimurium ( Fig. 2d ) . 
The long-lasting antiporin IgG antibodies showed a sustained bactericidal/binding activity to S. typhi , even though the long-lasting antibody titres measured by ELISA were lower ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . 
This notable immunogenicity of porins to sustain bactericidal antibody memory response could be explained by either of the following non-exclu-sive mechanisms . 
First , because salmonella porins are good immunogens and porins from other 20,21,27,33,36 -- 42 pathogens have been identiﬁed as TLR2 agonists . 
29 -- 31 Thus , during the initial immune response , it is possible that salmonella porins might be simultaneously recognized by B-cell receptors and innate receptors , such as 
TLRs , thereby inducing the differentiation of naive B cells into effector antibody-secreting plasma cells . 
We speculate that this strong initial activation would sustain antibody production by inducing the efﬁcient generation of memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells . 
Second , porins are highly hydrophobic proteins , a property that could 23 favour the formation of antigenic deposits in germinal centres , which might maintain the persisting antiporin antibody titres for life . 
The long-term antibody titres measured by ELISA decreased over time ( Fig. 1a ) . 
For example , at day 180 , antibody titres decreased 32-fold compared with the maximum peak ( secondary response ) . 
However , the bac-tericidal-binding capacities of these antibodies did not decrease with time ( Figs 1b and 2a ) and showed no cross-reactivity ( Fig. 2d ) . 
These results might indicate that a process of selection or afﬁnity maturation of species-speciﬁc antiporin antibodies occurs during the antibodymediated memory bactericidal response . 
The mechanisms involved in the induction of porin-speciﬁc memory antibody response are currently under investigation . 
Because IgM has a short half-life , the presence of low long-lasting antiporin IgM antibody titres ( Fig. 1a ) was an intriguing result . 
Consistent with our observation , a previous study described the production of anti-Borrellia IgM by B1b lymphocytes ( IgM IgD Mac1 CD5 ) for 230 days high low + -- after infection . 
It is possible that the long-term anti-52 porin IgM antibody levels are produced by B1b cells . 
The predominantly IgG subclasses in the antiporin memory response were IgG2b , IgG1 and IgG2a ( Fig. 1c ) . 
Because IgG1 has been described as a poor complement-ﬁxing subclass , it appears that the IgG2b and IgG2a are 48 the main subclasses responsible for the long-lasting bactericidal effect . 
In addition , we found all IgG subclasses in the secondary response ( Fig. 1c ) , despite the Th2-prone predisposition in BALB/c mice . 
This supports the role of porins as strong immunogens with the ability to generate a microenvironment that efﬁciently favours the immuno-globulin switch independent of genetic background . 
In addition , the presence of the poor complement-ﬁxing 
IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses suggests that additional protect-ive biological activities are mediated by these non-bacteri-cidal IgG subclasses . 
Because our antigen preparations contained traces of LPS , we addressed the possible adjuvant role of LPS in the generation of the long-lasting bactericidal antibody memory response by immunizing the LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice with our porin preparation . 
We found strong antiporin bactericidal titres for life ( Fig. 3b ) , indicating that the long-lasting bactericidal memory response induced by porins did not depend on the TLR4 adjuvant signal mediated by LPS . 
This observation is supported 50 by the low anti-LPS antibody titres in BALB/c mice ( Fig. 3a ) unable to kill the porin-deﬁcient salmonella strain ( Fig. 1b ) ; this rules out the possibility that the bactericidal activity mediated by antiporin antibodies was the result of the presence of natural or induced anti-LPS antibodies . 
In addition , control experiments using OVA + 2 ng LPS ( equivalent to the calculated trace amount of LPS present in porins ) for immunization had no adjuvant effect on OVA-speciﬁc IgG1 antibody titres or on the induction of other IgG subclasses . 
In contrast , immunization with OVA + 5 lg LPS induced a strong adjuvant effect , which was reﬂected in the increase in OVA-speciﬁc IgG1 antibody titres and in the induction of OVA-speciﬁc IgG2a and IgG2b antibody titres . 
Taken together , these results indicate that LPS was unlikely to account fully for the bactericidal antibody memory response induced by porins . 
Because porins are composed of OmpC and OmpF , we investigated whether the OmpC or the OmpF porin is required for induction of the long-lasting antibody memory response . 
Although antiOmpC and antiOmpF IgG subclasses showed similar kinetics , mostly during the secondary response ( Fig. 4a ) , we found high antiOmpC bactericidal titres after 300 days ( the last point tested ) , whereas antiOmpF bactericidal titres increased after boosting and were not detected by day 180 ( Fig. 4b ) . 
These results suggest a differential contribution of antiOmpC or antiOmpF antibodies to the bactericidal memory response : OmpC induces a persistent bactericidal response and OmpF generates only bactericidal antibodies after boosting , suggesting that the long-lasting antiOmpF antibodies recognize mainly epitopes not exposed on the bacterial surface . 
These results support the predominant role of OmpC in inducing the memory B-cell bactericidal immune response . 
Porins , especially OmpC , are highly conserved proteins among different salmonella strains . 
Despite the high 46 homology of porins , there have been reports of speciﬁc regions of the S. typhimurium OmpC porin that corres-47 pond to external loops . 
Additionally , we have previously reported that strain-speciﬁc epitopes on the S. typhi OmpC porin , which correspond to external loops 6 ( L6 ) and 7 ( L7 ) expressed at the bacterial surface , are available for non-cross-reactive antibody-binding recognition .

The observed lack of cross-reactivity to S. typhimurium in our current study indicates a strong bactericidal/binding speciﬁcity of the long-lasting antiporin sera ( Figs 1 and 2d ) . 
Thus , it seems likely that antiporin IgG antibodies are directed against species-speciﬁc B-cell epitopes in the OmpC porin , such as L6 and L7 . 
In conclusion , our study showed the capacity of S. typhi porins to induce a sustained , lifelong and speciﬁc bactericidal antibody response , independent of a possible TLR4-adjuvant signal delivered by traces of LPS present in our porin preparation . 
These unique antigenic characteristics are not found in most antigens , particularly in bacterial subunit vaccines . 
Our data support the use of porins as a suitable model to study the induction of immunological memory and to improve the development of subunit vaccines with the ability to confer long-lasting immunity .
