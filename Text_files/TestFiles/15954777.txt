Spectroscopic and Computational Studies of the ATP:Corrinoid Adenosyltransferase (CobA) from Salmonella enterica: Insights into the Mechanism of Adenosylcobalamin Biosynthesis
Abstract : CobA from Salmonella enterica is a member of an enzymatic system responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl ) , catalyzing the formation of the essential Co-C bond by transferring the adenosyl group from a molecule of ATP to a transient Co1 + corrinoid species generated in the enzyme active site . 
A particularly fascinating aspect of this reaction is that the flavodoxin in vivo reducing agent that serves as the electron donor to CobA possesses a reduction potential that is considerably more positive than that of the Co2 + / 1 + couple of the corrinoid substrate . 
To explore how CobA may overcome this challenge , we have employed electronic absorption , magnetic circular dichroism , and electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopies to probe the interaction between Co3 + - and Co2 + corrinoids and the enzyme active site . 
Our data reveal that while Co3 + corrinoids interact only weakly with CobA , Co2 + corrinoids undergo partial conversion to a new paramagnetic species that can be obtained in nearly quantitative yield when CobA is preincubated with the co-substrate ATP . 
This `` activated '' species is characterized by a distinct set of ligand field transitions in the near-IR spectral region and EPR parameters that are unprecedented for Co2 + corrinoids . 
Analysis of these data on the basis of qualitative spectral correlations and density functional theory computations reveals that this unique Co2 + corrinoid species possesses an essentially square-planar Co2 + center that lacks any significant axial bonding interactions . 
Possible implications of these findings for the mechanism of Co2 + f Co1 + reduction employed by CobA and Co-C bond-forming enzymes in general are explored . 
1. Introduction
Vitamin B12 ( cyanocobalamin , CNCbl ) is a nutrient necessary to sustain life in all animals , including humans ; yet , only a few species of prokaryotes ( including Salmonella enterica ) are able to accomplish the de novo synthesis of this complex cofactor .1 In CNCbl , the four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms of a highly substituted macrocycle , termed the corrin ring , equatorially ligate a low-spin Co3 + ion ( Figure 1 ) .2 The `` lower '' axial face of the Co is coordinated by a nitrogen atom from a 5,6-dimethylben-zimidazole ( DMB ) base , which is part of the nucleotide terminus of a molecular loop tethered to the corrin ring at C17 . 
A variety of ligands can bind in the `` upper '' axial position ( e.g. , CN - as in CNCbl ) ; however , cobalamin is biologically active only when this position is occupied by a methyl group , as in methyl ¬

cobalamin ( MeCbl ) , or an adenosyl group , as in coenzyme B12 ( adenosylcobalamin , AdoCbl ) .3 While higher order organisms lack the complete biosynthetic machinery needed to manufacture AdoCbl de novo , they possess adenosyltransferases that are able to catalyze the replacement of the upper axial ligand of exogenous cobalamins with the 5 ′ - deoxyadenosyl ( Ado ) group derived from a molecule of ATP .4,5 The Ado group is bound to the Co center through the 5 ′ - C , yielding one of Nature 's few examples of a stable organometallic bond .6 In humans , AdoCbl is employed as the cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ( MMCM ) , the isomerase responsible for catalyzing the rearrangement of the catabolite meth-ylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA .7 Malfunction of the human adenosyltransferase ( hATR ) can lead to potentially fatal disorders , such as methylmalonic aciduria and metabolic ketoacidosis .8 The biosynthetic route that leads to corrin-based cofactors utilizes over 25 enzymes to convert 5-aminolaevulinic acid to

cobyrinic acid , a cobalamin precursor that possesses all of the necessary functionality save the nucleotide loop and the Ado upper axial ligand . 
Cobyrinic acid is then adenosylated by a 21 kDa homodimeric adenosyltransferase ( CobA ) before entering the nucleotide loop assembly pathway .9,10 In addition to CobA , S. enterica employs two other evolutionarily distinct adenos-yltransferases , PduO and EutT ,11,12 yet CobA is the only transferase that efficiently adenosylates exogenous cobalamins as well as incomplete corrinoids ( such as cobinamides , Figure 1 ) that lack part or all of the nucleotide loop . 
Additionally , CobA is responsible for maintaining a basal concentration of AdoCbl to promote transcription of the eut operon that encodes proteins needed for the catabolism of ethanolamine .12,13 Included among the eut proteins is EutT , a presumably Fe-S cluster-containing adenosyltransferase12 that provides a ready supply of adenosy ¬

lated cobalamin to the eutBC gene product , an AdoCbl-dependent ethanolamine ammonia lyase ( EAL ) .14 PduO fulfills a similar role for the cobalamin-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol by the enzyme diol dehydratase ( DD ) .11 Interestingly , PduO from S. enterica bears significant sequence homology ( 26 % sequence identity ) to hATR that is co-translated with MMCM .15,16 Its ability to adenosylate both scavenged cobalamins and incomplete corrinoids originating from the de novo assembly pathway makes CobA an ideal target for studying the generic mechanistic requirements for adenosyl-group transfer . 
The current proposal for the CobA reaction mechanism is depicted in Figure 2 . 
While the general mechanism of the adenosyl-group transfer is fairly well established , several important questions concerning specific events in this process remain unanswered . 
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the mechanism depicted in Figure 2 ( from the point of view of electronic structure ) is that CobA is capable of generating a transient Co1 + corrinoid intermediate even though the Co2 + / 1 + reduction midpoint potential of unbound Co2 + Cbl ( E ° ) -610 mV ) 17 is well below that of the semiquinone/reduced flavin couple of FldA ( E ° ) -440 mV ) .18 Thus , an understanding of the mechanism by which CobA catalyzes Co-C bond formation provides a suitable framework not only for the subsequent investigation of the other adenosyltransferases described above but also for studies of MeCbl-dependent enzymes , such as methionine synthase ( MetH ) and the corrinoid Fe-S protein ( CFeSP ) , in which formation of a Co1 + Cbl intermediate constitutes one of the key steps in their respective reactivation mechanisms .3 Previously , our group has characterized the electronic structures of free cobalamins and cobinamides in both their Co3 + and Co2 + oxidation states using an array of spectroscopic methods in conjunction with density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations .19,20 Using our insights gained in these studies as a foundation , we have begun to examine the nature of enzyme-induced activation of corrinoids for several representative cobalamin-dependent systems , including MMCM ,21 MetH , glutamate mutase ( GM ) , and CFeSP . 
This report summarizes our efforts to characterize spectroscopically substrate binding events and intermediates involved in the adenosylation pathway employed by CobA . 
Specifically , MCD spectroscopy has been used to probe changes in the Co2 + ligand field ( LF , dfd ) transition energies upon binding of Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + - cobinamide ( Co2 + Cbi + , Figure 1 ) to the CobA active site . 
These data have been interpreted within the framework of spectral correlations to free Co3 + - and Co2 + corrinoids as well as DFT calculations on cofactor models and cobalamin analogues . 
Collectively , our results provide detailed insight into the mechanism by which CobA tunes the Co2 + / 1 + reduction potential so as to enable the formation of an active-site bound Co1 + - corrinoid `` supernucleophile '' that is the key reactive intermediate in the adenosylation pathway . 
2. Experimental Section
Cofactors and Chemicals . 
Aquacobalamin ( H2OCbl + ) , dicyanoco-binamide ( ( CN ) 2Cbi ) , AdoCbl , and sodium borohydride ( NaBH4 ) were purchased from Sigma and used as obtained . 
Diaquacobinamide ( ( H2O ) 2Cbi2 + ) was prepared by reducing a solution of ( CN ) 2Cbi with-BH4 , loading the reaction mixture onto a C18 SepPack column , and quenching with doubly distilled H O . 
The ( H O ) Cbi2 + product was 2 2 2 eluted with methanol and characterized by mass spectrometry and Abs spectroscopy . 
Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + Cbi + were prepared anaerobically by BH - 2 2 2 4 reduction of H OCbl + and ( H O ) Cbi2 + , respectively . 
Purification of CobA Enzyme . 
The ATP : corrinoid adenosyltransferase CobA from Salmonella enterica was overexpressed and isolated using previously published procedures .22 CobA purity ( > 95 % homogeneity ) was monitored with SDS-PAGE , and enzymatic activity ( 19.74 nmol of AdoCbl produced/min ‚ mg of CobA ) was determined using the corrinoid adenosylation assay developed previously .22 All samples used in this study contained 0.40 mM CobA in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) to enhance protein stability , and 60 % ( v/v ) of the glassing agent glycerol . 
Sample Preparation . 
Solutions of the free corrinoids and CobA were purged separately with N2 gas for 20 min at 4 °C and subsequently combined in a 0.9:1.0 ratio in a sealed anaerobic vial . 
The resulting mixtures were equilibrated for 5 min under constant N pressure and 2 then injected simultaneously into MCD cells and quartz EPR tubes that were then immediately frozen in liquid N2 . 
CobA samples containing the co-substrate ATP were prepared by anaerobically incubating the enzyme for 20 min at 4 °C with a 20-fold molar excess of ATP . 
Spectroscopy . 
Low-temperature electronic Abs , CD , and MCD spectra were acquired using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in conjunction with an Oxford Instruments SpectroMag-4000 8T magnetocryostat . 
All MCD spectra shown in this paper were obtained by taking the difference between the spectra collected with the magnetic field aligned parallel and antiparallel to the light propagation axis . 
X-band EPR data were collected using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with an Oxford ESR 900 continuous flow liquid helium cryostat , an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller , and a Varian EIP model 625A CW frequency counter . 
All spectra were accumulated under nonsaturating conditions ( see caption of Figure 6 for details of spectral acquisition ) . 
EPR data were simulated using the WEPR program written by Dr. Frank Neese .23 Complete parameter sets employed for the EPR simulations are given in the Supporting Information . 
Computations . 
( i ) Models . 
A computational model of Co2 + Cbi + ( `` unperturbed '' model ) was generated starting from the published crystal structure coordinates of Co2 + Cbl ,24 replacing the lower axial ligand by an H O molecule and truncating the peripheral corrin ring substituents , 2 as described in our earlier work on free Co2 + corrinoids .20 To generate 
Scheme 1. Chemical Structure of [Co(Me6[14]dieneN4)]
Co2 + Cbi + models along the lower ligand dissociation pathway , the Co-OH2 bond was systematically lengthened in increments of 0.05 Å from the unperturbed distance of 2.201 Å , while the coordinates of all other atoms were kept fixed . 
For computational studies on N-rac - [ Co2 + -5,7,7,12,14,14 - hexa-methyl-1 ,4,8,11 - tetraazacyclotetradeca-4 ,11 - diene ( H O ) ] ( abbreviated 2 [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] , Scheme 1 ) , the input geometry was based on the corresponding X-ray crystal structure coordinates ,25 where the Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ligand H atoms were added at a distance of 1.1 Å from their respective C atoms . 
The coordinates of the H atoms of the axially bound water molecule were energy minimized using the Amsterdam Density Functional ( ADF ) 2003.02 suite of programs26-28 29 with the Vosko-Wilk-Nusair local density approximation ( VWN ) 30 31 and the gradient corrections of Becke and Perdew for exchange and correlation , respectively . 
This calculation was carried out on an Intel Xeon cluster ( ACE computers ) employing ADF basis set IV and an integration constant of 4.0 . 
Atomic coordinates for the Co2 + Cbi + and [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] models are provided in the Supporting Information . 
( ii ) Single Point DFT Calculations . 
Ground state DFT calculations were executed on a desktop PC using the ORCA 2.2 software package developed by Dr. Frank Neese ( MPI Mülheim , Germany ) .32 The Perdew-Wang LDA ( PW-LDA ) 33 in conjunction with the gradient corrections by Becke34 and Perdew31 was chosen for all DFT computations , following our earlier work on free Co2 + corrinoids . 
Electronic excitation energies and intensities for all models were calculated by the TD-DFT method35-37 within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation38 ,39 as implemented in ORCA 2.2 . 
The predicted Abs spectra were simulated assuming that each electronic transition gives rise to a Gaussian band with full width at half-maximum of ν1 / 2 ) 1250 cm-1 . 
Finally , molecular g values and hyperfine parameters were calculated with the ORCA program by solving the coupled-perturbed SCF ( CP-SCF ) equations40 employing the PW-LDA functional .

Co3 + CorrinoidTCobA Interaction . 
In our previous Abs and MCD spectroscopic and DFT computational studies of free 3 + 19 Co corrinoid species , we found that the axial ligand basicity modulates the mixing of Co 3d-orbitals with the corrin ring π / π * frontier molecular orbitals ( MOs ) , thereby varying the energy of the lowest-energy corrin-based πfπ * ( cor πfπ * ) transition that is responsible for the so-called R-band in the corresponding Abs spectra . 
Therefore , the position of the R-band provides a sensitive reporter of changes in the axial ligation upon binding of a given Co3 + corrinoid to a protein active site . 
Using this relationship between shifts of the R-band position and axial perturbations , the nature of the interaction between the substrate H OCbl + and CobA was monitored in both the absence and 2 the presence of the co-substrate ATP . 
H OCbl + + CobA . 
+ 2 The Abs spectra of unbound H2OCbl ( pH 5 ) , HOCbl ( pH 9 ) , and ( H2O ) 2Cbi2 + are compared in Figure 3 ( top panel ) . 
All three species exhibit so-called `` typical '' corrinoid Abs spectra characterized by a prominent feature in the visible region , which exhibits a partially resolved vibrational progression that includes the R - and â-bands , and an intense feature centered in the UV region , designated as the γ-band . 
Upon the addition of a buffered solution of CobA , the Abs + R spectrum of H2OCbl changes significantly ; both the - and γ-bands decrease in intensity and red-shift by 400 and 470 cm-1 , respectively ( cf. Figure 3A , D ) . 
However , these spectral changes can be attributed primarily to deprotonation of the cobalamin to yield HOCbl ( cf. Figure 3B ) , as the protein solution was buffered to a pH of 8.0 while the pKa of the water ligand of + 41 free H2OCbl is 7.6 . 
Interestingly , though , a new feature is observed at 21 200 cm-1 that has no counterpart in the Abs

spectrum of any Co corrinoid . 
This feature is reminiscent of 2 + the R-band of Co corrinoids ( vide infra ) , suggesting that the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) in the buffer caused 2 + partial reduction of the corrinoid to Co Cbl . 
+ + H2OCbl + CobA/ATP . 
The Abs spectrum of H2OCbl in the presence of the CobA/ATP complex is almost identical to that of H2OCbl + / CobA ( cf. Figure 3D , E ) . 
This result suggests that the presence of ATP in the CobA active site has little effect on the electronic structure of the bound Co3 + corrinoid substrate + or that H2OCbl does not actually bind to the enzyme . 
Nevertheless , the relative intensity of the Abs feature at 21 200 cm-1 attributed to the R-band of Co2 + corrinoid increases by 12 % when ATP is present , possibly suggesting that reduced cobalamin is more readily bound , and thus protected against reoxidation , when CobA is complexed with ATP . 
3.2 . 
Co2 + CorrinoidTCobA Interaction . 
( i ) Abs and MCD . 
Similar to the case of Co3 + corrinoids , the energy of the R-band transition of Co2 + corrinoids ( involving the same pair of cor π / π * - based donor and acceptor MOs as the R-band transition of Co3 + corrinoids ) is also sensitive to the identity of the lower ligand , undergoing a 150 cm-1 blue-shift upon substitution of the DMB ligand of Co2 + Cbl with a water molecule to yield Co2 + Cbi + ( cf. Figures 4A and 5A ) .20 Both Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + - Cbi + are paramagnetic ( S ) 1 / ) species and give rise to richly 2 structured , temperature-dependent MCD spectra . 
Detailed analyses of these spectra within the framework of TD-DFT calculations revealed that electronic transitions can be classified as 2 + 2 + being either Co ligand field ( LF ) , Co fcor π * charge transfer ( CT ) , or cor πfπ * in nature ( Figure 4A ) . 
On the basis of these assignments , changes in spectral features upon corrinoid binding to CobA can be analyzed in terms of molecular perturbations so as to determine possible modes of activation 2 + of Co Cbl for further reduction . 
2 + Co Cbl + CobA . 
The Abs spectrum of Co2 + Cbl in the presence of a slight excess of CobA ( Figure 4B ) is qualitatively similar to that of free Co2 + Cbl ( Figure 4A ) . 
Although the latter spectrum exhibits slightly increased intensity around 18 000 -1 cm , this difference can be ascribed to a small fraction of oxidized cobalamin ( i.e. , HOCbl ) . 
While Abs spectroscopy alone yields little insight into the nature of the interaction between 2 + Co Cbl and CobA , low-temperature MCD spectroscopy provides a much more sensitive probe of this interaction . 
Comparison of the MCD spectra in Figure 4A , B reveals only small differences in intensity distribution throughout the CT and cor π π f * spectral regions . 
Notably , both the LF transition energies R and the - band position are virtually identical for the free and 2 + CobA-bound Co Cbl species , precluding any significant 2 + perturbation of the Co coordination environment in the enzyme active site . 
2 + + Co Cbl CobA/ATP . 
In contrast to the rather modest 2 + spectral changes accompanying Co Cbl binding to substrate - ∆ ) free CobA described above , a significant blue-shift ( 450 -1 R -1 cm ) of the - band to 21 550 cm is observed in the Abs 2 + spectrum of Co Cbl upon the addition of CobA that was incubated with a 20-fold excess of the co-substrate ATP ( Figure 4C ) . 
Likewise , the corresponding MCD spectrum exhibits pronounced differences in signal intensity throughout the entire spectral region ( in particular , near 18 000 and 28 000 cm-1 ) compared to the free Co2 + Cbl spectrum . 
Most striking , however , is the appearance of a temperature-dependent MCD feature at 12 400 cm-1 . 
Because this feature has no obvious counterpart in the Abs spectrum ( Figure 4C ) , it can attributed to an LF transition of Co2 + , as transitions of this type are formally electric dipole forbidden .42 The shift in R-band energy coupled with the appearance a new LF transition suggests that the presence of ATP in the CobA active site triggers significant changes in the Co2 + coordination environment . 
Co2 + Cbi + + CobA . 
In an attempt to obtain further insight into the nature of the paramagnetic species responsible for the MCD feature at 12 400 cm-1 in the spectrum of Co2 + Cbl + CobA/ATP ( Figure 4C ) , the spectroscopic studies described above were repeated with Co2 + cobinamide ( Co2 + Cbi + ) , a precursor of Co2 + Cbl that lacks the nucleotide loop ( Figure 1 ) . 
Comparison of the Abs spectra of free Co2 + Cbi + ( Figure 5A ) and Co2 + Cbi + in the presence of substrate-free CobA ( Figure 5B ) reveals a small blue-shift ( ∆ ) 100 cm-1 ) of the R-band to 21 350 cm-1 in the latter spectrum . 
Additional Abs features at 17 350 and 18 700 cm-1 coincide with the R - and â-bands of the ( H2O ) 2Cbi2 + starting material ( see Figure 3C ) , signaling that some reoxidation of the Co2 + corrinoid species occurred ( as for Co2 + Cbl , vide supra ) . 
Inspection of the corresponding low-temperature MCD spectra ( Figure 5A , B ) reveals that , in fact , two paramagnetic species are present in the Co2 + Cbi + + CobA sample . 
The dominant component exhibits spectral features nearly identical to those of unbound Co2 + Cbi + , suggesting that substrate-free CobA does not significantly interact with Co2 + - + Cbi , as well . 
However , the appearance of the MCD feature at 12 400 cm-1 indicates that some portion of Co2 + Cbi + is converted to a species similar to that observed in the MCD spectrum of Co2 + Cbl bound to the CobA/ATP complex ( Figure 4C ) . 
Co2 + Cbi + + CobA/ATP . 
As noted above for Co2 + Cbl , the Abs spectrum of Co2 + Cbi + is also greatly altered upon corrinoid binding to the CobA/ATP complex ( cf. Figure 5A , C ) . 
Most notably , the R-band shifts to 21 550 cm-1 , which is similar to the position of the R-band in the spectrum of Co2 + Cbl obtained under identical conditions ( Figure 4C ) . 
The low-temperature 2 + + MCD spectrum of the Co Cbi + CobA/ATP sample ( Figure 5C ) is completely unprecedented , being dominated entirely by features that have no counterparts in the spectrum of any unbound Co2 + corrinoid studied to date .20 On the basis of their large MCD-to-Abs intensity ratios , the transitions at 12 400 , 13 700 , and 19 000 cm-1 are readily assigned as LF transitions . 
In comparison , the features appearing between 21 100 and 30 000 cm-1 have much smaller MCD-to-Abs intensity ratios ; thus , they are attributed to CT and cor πfπ * transitions .43 The striking perturbation of the LF transitions when the free Co2 + - corrinoids ( Figures 4A and 5A ) bind to the CobA/ATP complex can only be rationalized by a dramatic change in the coordination environment of the initially five-coordinate Co2 + center . 
To interpret these spectral changes in terms of molecular perturbations , it is important to note that all MCD features attributed to LF transitions are positively signed in both the free and the CobA/ATP-bound Co2 + Cbi + spectra ( Figure 5A , C ) .

( 43 ) The weak MCD features at 17 000 and 18 000 cm-1 are due to residual unbound Co2 + Cbi + . 
tively , in the case of Co2 + Cbl , an almost even distribution of positively and negatively signed MCD features associated with the LF transitions is observed ( Figure 4A ) . 
The dominance of positive signal intensity exhibited by the Co2 + Cbi + MCD spectra is characteristic of low-lying excited states mixing into the ground state via spin-orbit coupling . 
The fact that this excess 2 + + positive intensity persists upon binding of Co Cbi to the CobA/ATP complex indicates that the resulting species also possesses ( a ) low-lying excited state ( s ) , consistent with a weak axial LF component experienced by the Co2 + center in the protein-bound corrinoid . 
Moreover , the presence of the 12 400 -1 cm feature in all MCD spectra of CobA-bound Co2 + corrinoids discussed above implies that the nature of the unique Co2 + - corrinoid species that is generated in the CobA/ATP active site is largely independent of the identity of the lower axial ligand in the free corrinoid substrate . 
( ii ) EPR . 
MCD experiments described above were complemented with EPR studies , as this technique provides a uniquely sensitive probe of the axial ligation of Co2 + corrinoids . 
X-band ( 9.36 GHz ) EPR spectra recorded at 40 K for all Co2 + corrinoid samples described above are presented in Figure 6.44 The addition of substrate-free CobA to a solution containing Co2 + - Cbl has no major effect on the corresponding EPR spectrum but nonetheless causes a minor sharpening of the axial nitrogen superhyperfine features centered at 3400 G ( Figure 6B ) , suggesting that the Co-Nax bond is more constrained in the protein active site . 
Interestingly , this sharpening becomes much more pronounced when ATP-bound rather than substrate-free CobA is added to the Co2 + Cbl solution ( Figure 6C ) , allowing for the resolution of 14N superhyperfine splittings on all but the highest field feature . 
The EPR spectrum of Co2 + Cbi + bound to substrate-free CobA ( Figure 6E ) is nearly identical to that of the free corrinoid ( Figure 6D ) , the exception being the appearance of a small derivative-shaped feature at 2200 G. Importantly , the metal hyperfine splitting remains unchanged , and furthermore , no additional fine structure appears that would signal axial coordination of an atom possessing a nuclear magnetic moment ( e.g. , 14N , I ) 1 ) . 
This finding precludes that upon corrinoid binding to CobA , an active site histidine residue displaces the H2O ligand , a binding scheme employed by several B12-dependent enzymes.45-48 While the spectral changes induced by binding Co2 + Cbi + to substrate-free CobA are rather insignificant , much more dramatic perturbations to the EPR spectrum are observed when ATP-bound CobA is used instead ( Figure 6F ) . 
The series of sharp negative resonances in this spectrum centered at g ) 2.00 and split by 140 G indicate that some of the Co2 + Cbi + does not interact strongly with the CobA/ATP complex ( possibly reflecting a sizable population of unbound corrinoid ) ; this contribution was removed by subtracting the suitably scaled ( × 0.33 ) Co2 + Cbi + + CobA spectrum ( Figure 6E ) to obtain the trace shown in Figure 6G . 
Simulation of the resulting spectrum requires nearly axial g values and unusually large 59Co hyperfine parameters A ( 59Co ) ( Table 1 ) . 
Not surprisingly , given the uniqueness of the MCD spectrum exhibited by this species ( Figure 5C ) , such EPR parameters had never before been reported for any Co2 + corrinoid species . 
The implications of these results with respect to the molecular structure of Co2 + Cbi + bound to the CobA/ATP complex will be explored in 3.4 .

AdoCblTCobA Interaction . 
Abs , CD , and MCD spectra of free AdoCbl and AdoCbl in the presence of ATP-bound CobA are presented in Figure 7 . 
While the two data sets are nearly indistinguishable , the addition of the CobA/ATP complex to a solution of the AdoCbl product causes a sharpening 
( 44 ) As the EPR spectra of free Co2 + Cbl ( Figure 6A ) and Co2 + Cbi + ( Figure 6D ) are essentially identical to previously published data ( EPR parameters are listed in Table 1 ) , it can be concluded that neither the buffer nor the presence of ATP in the solution has any effect on the Co2 + corrinoid spectral properties . 
The small negative feature at 3250 G ( g ) 2.00 ) is due to a 2 + minor Cu impurity that resides in the EPR cavity . 
Collecting high temperature ( 40 K ) data minimizes this contribution to the EPR spectra .

More pronounced differences are evident in the so-called γ-region ( near 27 000 -1 cm ) where several cor πfπ * transitions contribute to the Abs 19 envelope . 
Similar spectral changes were observed upon binding of AdoCbl to apo-MMCM , results that were attributed to the imposition of a strict conformation on the Ado moiety and a 21 decreased local dielectric constant in the enzyme active site . 
Collectively , these findings suggest that AdoCbl does bind to the CobA/ATP complex , albeit without undergoing significant geometric and electronic changes . 
3.4 . 
Spectro/Structural Correlation . 
The spectroscopic data presented above indicate that a unique Co2 + corrinoid species is generated when either Co2 + Cbl or Co2 + Cbi + binds to the CobA/ATP complex . 
This finding is not necessarily surprising considering that CobA must somehow activate the Co2 + corrinoid substrate so as to facilitate its reduction to the Co1 + state . 
One way such an activated species may be generated in the enzyme active site is through manipulation of the lower ligand bonding interaction , as this would provide a means for a direct modulation of the energy of the redox-active Co dz2-based molecular orbital ( MO ) . 
To test this hypothesis , DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed on Co2 + Cbi + models differing with respect to their lower ligand bond length . 
The Co-OH2 coordinate was systematically varied from 2.100 to 2.650 Å , and for each configuration , the corresponding Abs spectrum and EPR parameters were computed . 
( i ) Validation of Computational Approach and Implications for Co2 + Cbi + Spectral Assignments . 
To validate the use of the computational approach described above for the prediction of Co2 + Cbi + LF transition energies and g values as a function of the Co-OH2 distance , we also performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations on the well-characterized Co2 + complex N-rac - [ Co2 + -5,7,7,12,14,14 - hexamethyl-1 ,4,8,11 - tetraazacyclotetradeca - 4,11-diene ( H2O ) ] , hereafter referred to as [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) - ( H2O ) ] ( Scheme 1 ) .25 This complex was chosen for its structural similarity to Co2 + Cbi + , as the metal center is ligated equatorially by a tetradentate N-based ligand ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) that mimics the corrin ring and also possesses an axially bound water molecule with a Co-OH2 bond distance of 2.315 Å . 
Magnetic susceptibility and EPR experiments on [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) - ( H2O ) ] demonstrated that this complex is low-spin ( S ) 1/2 ) and indicated that the unpaired electron resides in the Co 3dz2-based MO. 49 Consistent with these experimental findings , our DFT calculations carried out on a complete model of [ Co ( Me6 - [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] predict a Co ( 3dz2 ) 1 ground state electron configuration . 
Selected LF transition energies computed using TD-DFT are presented in Table 2 , along with published experimental results from near-IR Abs studies .25,49 This comparison reveals that the BP TD-DFT method overestimates the energy of these LF transitions by ∼ 6500 cm-1 . 
Interestingly , the predicted energies for [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] are similar to those computed previously for the `` unperturbed '' Co2 + Cbi + model ( cf. Table S5 ) , suggesting that the Co2 + Cbi + LF transition energies are also overestimated by ∼ 6500 cm-1 . 
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that much lower LF excited state energies are computed for both the Co2 + Cbi + and [ Co ( Me [ 14 ] dieneN ) ( H O ) ] models by using the semiempirical 6 4 2 intermediate neglect of differential overlap ( INDO/S-CI ) 50,51 or Slater half-electron excitation methods52 ( Tables 2 and S5 ) , computational approaches that have been used with considerable success in past studies of bioinorganic systems . 
Importantly , regardless of the method used , our calculations consistently predict similar LF transition energies for Co2 + Cbi + and [ Co - ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] ( cf. Tables S5 and S6 ) . 
Therefore , it is likely that the Co2 + dxzfdz2 and dyzfdz2 transitions of Co2 + - Cbi + lie outside the range accessible to our MCD instrument , and that the observed lowest energy transition for this species ( Figure 5A ) formally involves excitation of an electron from the Co 3dxy-orbital to the singly occupied dz2-orbital . 
Comparison of the experimental and CP-SCF computed EPR parameters for the [ Co ( Me6 [ 14 ] dieneN4 ) ( H2O ) ] model indicates that gx and gy are significantly underestimated relative to their experimental values ( Table 3 ) . 
Additionally , the 59Co hyperfine parameters , which provide a measure of the unpaired spin density on the metal nucleus , are considerably overestimated by the CP-SCF method . 
In an attempt to improve upon these results , EPR g values were also calculated using the zeroth-order regular approximation ( ZORA ) to the Hamiltonian ; 53,54 however , these computations yielded no significant improvement over those employing CP-SCF DFT ( Table 3 ) . 
Collectively , these results indicate that DFT-based computational approaches fail at reliably predicting EPR parameters of Co2 + corrinoidlike systems . 
Therefore , the g values and 59Co hyperfine parameters derived from the experimental EPR spectrum of Co2 + Cbi + bound to the CobA/ATP complex ( Figure 6G ) were interpreted within the framework of spectral correlations to well-characterized Co2 + - containing macrocyclic systems ( see Effects on EPR Parameters below ) . 
( ii ) Effects on Abs Spectrum . 
To examine the effects of perturbations along the axial coordinate on the excited state electronic structure of Co2 + Cbi + , TD-DFT was used to compute the Abs spectra for a series of Co2 + Cbi + models with differing Co-OH2 bond lengths ( Figure 8A ) . 
These computations predict that the dominant feature in the visible region ( the R-band ) blue-shifts by ∼ 15 cm-1 / pm as the Co-OH2 bond length is increased from its equilibrium value of 2.201 Å . 
While the donor MO involved in the corresponding transition is mostly cor π-based , it also possesses significant ( 37 % ) Co 3dz2-orbital character as well as a small contribution ( 2 % ) from an oxygen-based lonepair of the H2O ligand , making it weakly Co OH2 σ-antibond-ing . 
Thus , the blue-shift of the R-band with increasing Co-OH2 bond length can be understood in terms of a weakening of this σ-antibonding interaction . 
Yet , it is primarily the perturbation of the LF transitions , which carry little intensity in the Abs spectrum , that gives rise to the massive differences between our experimental MCD spectra ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . 
As a weakening of the Co-OH2 σ-antibonding interaction stabilizes MOs with significant Co 3d 2-orbital character , LF transitions originating from these z

orbitals exhibit considerable blue-shifts with increasing lower ligand bond length . 
Alternatively , LF transitions that terminate in the Co 3dz2-based spin-down LUMO display large red-shifts in response to Co-OH bond lengthening . 
This prediction that 2 some transitions shift toward lower energy upon weakening of the lower ligand bonding interaction is verified by our TD-DFT results ( Figure 8B ) and provides a rationale for the red-shift ( to 12 400 cm-1 ) of the experimentally observed lowest energy MCD feature , assigned to the Co2 + dxyfdz2 transition , upon Co2 + Cbi + binding to the CobA/ATP complex ( Figure 5A , C ) . 
( iii ) Effects on EPR Parameters . 
As demonstrated in the previous section , elongation of the Co-OH2 bond of Co2 + Cbi + causes significant shifts of the LF transitions . 
Molecular g values are predicted to be similarly sensitive to distortions along this coordinate , as stabilization of the Co 3dz2-based MO allows for more efficient mixing via spin-orbit coupling of the Co2 + dxzfdz2 and dyzfdz2 excited states into the ground state , thereby causing gx and gy to shift further away from the free electron value ( Table S10 ) . 
Furthermore , lengthening the lower ligand bond reduces the Co-OH2 bond covalency , thus giving rise to increased unpaired spin density on the Co center . 
These qualitative predictions concur nicely with the dramatic changes in g values and 59Co hyperfine parameters observed by EPR spectroscopy when Co2 + Cbi + binds to the CobA/ATP complex ( Table 1 , Figure 6G ) . 
Collectively , these results hint toward a description of the enzyme-bound species as an essentially fourcoordinate square-planar Co2 + complex with , perhaps , a weakly interacting oxygen-based axial ligand . 
Strong support for this description is provided by the strikingly similar appearance of the EPR spectrum in Figure 6G and those reported for Co2 + - porphyrins55 and Co2 + pthalocyanines56 that are rigorously fourcoordinate ( square-planar ) or weakly bind a solvent ( e.g. , H2O ) molecule in the axial position . 
EPR parameters for representative members of these two classes of synthetic Co2 + complexes are included in Table 1 . 
4. Discussion
Considerable research effort has been directed toward elucidating the geometric and electronic factors contributing to the remarkable activation of the Co-C bond of AdoCbl ( Figure 1 ) for homolysis by B - dependent enzymes.57-62 12 In contrast , the biological formation of this unique organometallic bond that lies at the heart of the reactivity of the coenzyme B12 has attracted relatively little attention .12,22,63 In this study , we have built upon the foundation established in our earlier characterization of free Co3 + - and Co2 + corrinoids to analyze changes in Abs and MCD spectroscopic data of physiologically relevant precursors of AdoCbl as they interact with the bacterial adenosyltransferase CobA . 
Key insights gained from these studies are summarized below , and their possible implications for the mechanism of Co2 + fCo1 + reduction employed by Co-C bond-forming enzymes are explored . 
CorrinoidTCobA Interactions . 
( i ) Co3 + Corrinoids . 
Abs and CD spectra of H2OCbl + in the presence of CobA ( Figures 3D and S2 ) are different from those of unbound H2OCbl + ( Figures 3A and S1 ) , yet similar to those of free HOCbl ( Figures 3B and S1 ) , as expected considering that the protein-containing sample was sufficiently basic ( pH 8.0 ) to promote deprotonation of the upper axial H2O ligand of H + 2OCbl ( pKa of 7.6 ) .41 The only notable difference between the H2OCbl + / CobA and unbound HOCbl data sets is the presence of an additional feature at ∼ 21 100 cm-1 in the former , attributed to base-on Co2 + Cbl on the basis of corresponding MCD data ( cf. Figures 4A and S2 ) . 
Analogous spectroscopic studies of H OCbl + 2 in the presence of the CobA/ATP complex provide nearly identical

results , also revealing that the cobalamin cofactor is converted to HOCbl and that a significant portion is reduced to the Co2 + oxidation state . 
Interestingly , however , a modest ( ∼ 12 % ) increase in the yield of HOCbl conversion to Co2 + Cbl is observed when co-substrate ATP is present in the CobA active site , suggesting that the CobA/ATP complex has a higher affinity for Co2 + Cbl and/or raises the Co3 + / 2 + reduction potential relative to the ATP-free form of the enzyme . 
While the results described above are not conclusive as to whether Co3 + corrinoids actually bind to the CobA active site , the small but notable spectral changes observed upon the addition of ATP-bound CobA to a solution of AdoCbl ( Figure 7 ) indicate that CobA does indeed interact with Co3 + corrinoids . 
In particular , the increased Abs intensity in the γ-region is characteristic of a decrease in the dielectric constant resulting from the exclusion of water from the local environment of the cofactor , consistent with the crystallographic observation of an N-terminal R-helix of CobA that is properly positioned to seal off the active site from bulk solvent .9 Importantly , while some bands in the γ-region exhibit minor changes in peak position and intensity , the R - and â-bands are not perturbed to any significant degree . 
On the basis of our previous spectro/structural correlation studies of alkyl-Co3 + corrinoids ,21 this observation definitively precludes any strong protein interaction with the axial ligands and , ultimately , is consistent with the need for CobA to readily dissociate the product . 
( ii ) Co2 + Corrinoids . 
On the basis of the close resemblance of the corresponding MCD spectra ( Figure 4 ) , the geometric and electronic structures of Co2 + Cbl are not significantly perturbed when this species binds to CobA , indicating that the lower ligand coordination by DMB is maintained in the enzyme active site . 
However , in the presence of co-substrate ATP , a small portion ( ∼ 10 % ) of the Co2 + Cbl substrate is converted to an unprecedented paramagnetic species characterized by a LF transition with positively signed , prominent MCD intensity at 12 400 cm-1 . 
As this feature is not present in the MCD spectrum of free Co2 + Cbi + ( Figure 5A ) , the spectral changes that accompany binding of Co2 + Cbl to CobA can not be rationalized solely in terms of a protein-induced replacement of the DMB with a water molecule ( a scenario uncovered recently for hATR ) .64 When substrate-free CobA is treated with Co2 + Cbi + , the same unique paramagnetic species is formed , albeit in greater yield ( Figure 5B ) . 
With ATP also bound to the CobA active site , Co2 + Cbi + is almost completely converted to this new species ( Figure 5C ) , allowing for a full spectroscopic characterization of this putative Co2 + corrinoid/CobA intermediate . 
Our data indicate that this species exhibits a unique set of LF transitions that dominate the near-IR region of the MCD spectrum , as well as a blue-shifted R-band Abs feature ( by 450 cm-1 ) , signifying a weakened interaction between the Co 3d-orbitals and the cor π-based frontier MOs .20 The EPR spectrum of the Co2 + Cbi + / CobA/ATP ternary complex ( Figure 6G ) indicates that 67 % of the corrinoid substrate converts to a new species characterized by g values 59 and Co A parameters that are strikingly different from those reported for any free Co2 + corrinoid ( Figure 6 , Table 1 ) . 
Quantitative analysis of the corresponding EPR spectrum yields g ⊥ values ( ∼ 2.7 ) and components of the 59Co hyperfine tensor

( ∼ 800 and ∼ 600 MHz for A | | and A ⊥ , respectively ) that are unusually large for a Co2 + corrinoid ; however , these parameters are in fact remarkably similar to those reported for Co2 + - porphyrins55 and Co2 + pthalocyanines56 ( Table 1 ) , wherein the lower ligand is considerably removed from the Co2 + ion or is completely absent . 
Consequently , it is tempting to speculate that the Co2 + corrinoid species present in the CobA/ATP complex is significantly perturbed with respect to this lower ligand coordinate . 
Support for this proposal is provided by the Co2 + - Cbi + spectro/structural correlation developed in this work . 
Specifically , our computations predict that a 0.3 Å elongation of the Co-OH2 bond will blue-shift the R-band maximum by ∼ 500 cm-1 , red-shift the d fd 2 LF transition by ∼ 3000 cm-1 xy z ( Figure 8 ) , and substantially raise the g ⊥ values ( Table S10 ) , all in striking agreement with our experimental data . 
These massive changes in spectroscopic properties primarily reflect the decrease in Co-OH2 σ-antibonding interaction and consequent stabilization of the Co 3dz2-orbital in response to a partial dissociation of the lower axial ligand . 
Collectively , our results strongly suggest that the species responsible for the unique MCD and EPR spectral features observed for CobA-containing samples of Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + Cbi + is best described as possessing an essentially four-coordinate Co2 + center that lacks any significant axial bonding interactions . 
Possible implications of this remarkable finding for the function of CobA are explored in the next section . 
Activation Mechanism for Corrinoid Reduction Employed by CobA . 
It has been shown that Flavodoxin A ( FldA ) is a flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) - dependent electrontransferase that serves as the terminal member of a system of enzymes designed to harness the reducing power of NADH and is capable of providing the electron required for the Co2 + fCo1 + reduction in the CobA active site ( Figure 2 ) .65 A most intriguing aspect of this reaction is that the one-electron reduction of free Co2 + - Cbl is physiologically unfeasible , as the corresponding midpoint potential ( E ° ) -610 mV vs SHE ) 17 is much lower than that of FldA ( E ° ) -440 mV for the semiquinone/reduced FMN couple18 ) ; therefore , for this reduction to become thermodynamically favorable , CobA must suitably activate the corrinoid substrate . 
One possible strategy for activating enzyme-bound Co2 + Cbl would involve replacing the axial DMB ligand ( Figure 1 ) with a weaker donor to stabilize the redox-active Co dz2-based MO ; for example , DMBfH2O substitution is expected ∼ to raise E ° by 120 mV , corresponding to the difference in reduction potentials of Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + Cbi + ( E ° ) -490 mV ) .17 However , the crystal structure of HOCbl bound to the CobA/ATP complex suggests that no such axial substitution actually occurs .9 Likewise , our data conclusively demonstrate that when Co2 + Cbl binds to CobA , it retains the DMB lower axial ligand ( Figures 4C and 6C ) . 
Nonetheless , while these observations rule out that CobA-bound Co2 + Cbl spontaneously converts to a typical `` base-off '' ( i.e. , Co2 + Cbi + - like ) species , our MCD and EPR data reveal that a small fraction is converted to a Co2 + corrinoid derivative with spectroscopic signatures

reminiscent of square-planar Co2 + species ( Table 1 ) . 
Nearly complete conversion to this `` activated '' species is achieved when the physiologically more relevant substrate Co2 + Cbi + is used instead , presumably because the corresponding Co-OH2 bond is weaker than the Co-DMB bond in Co2 + Cbl .20 On the basis of our spectro/structural correlation , the lengthening of the lower ligand bond by ∼ 0.3 Å , in the activated Co2 + corrinoid species ( vide supra ) , results in a 0.266 eV stabilization of the Co 3dz2-based redox-active MO. . 
Such a change in electronic structure should raise the Co2 + / 1 + reduction potential by ∼ 250 mV , thereby ensuring ample thermodynamic driving force for the reduction of the CobA-bound Co2 + corrinoid substrate by FldA . 
The fact that this activated Co2 + corrinoid species is formed in high yield only in the presence of ATP provides a means by which the enzyme can control the timing of Co2 + fCo1 + reduction so as to protect itself from being attacked by the transiently formed Co1 + corrinoid `` supernucleophile '' . 
While we have demonstrated herein that CobA accomplishes the thermodynamically challenging Co2 + fCo1 + corrinoid reduction step by promoting partial dissociation of the Co2 + corrinoid 's lower axial ligand , a key question that remains is whether all Co-C bond-forming enzymes employ the same general strategy for Co2 + fCo1 + corrinoid reduction despite their vastly different structures . 
Although answering this question is a major objective of ongoing research efforts in our laboratory , EPR and MCD spectroscopic data obtained for other members of this class of enzymes indeed hint toward a common mechanism for promoting reduction of the Co2 + corrinoid substrate .66 By complementing spectroscopic studies with site-directed mutagenesis , we anticipate that significant new insight will be obtained into the detailed mechanism employed by these enzymes to achieve , and control the extent of , this extraordinary activation of their Co2 + - corrinoid substrates for one-electron reduction .
