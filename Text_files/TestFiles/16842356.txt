Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi uses type IVB pili to facilitate eukaryotic cell invasion . 
Here , we compare environmental and genetic controls on pil operon transcription with those regulating viaB genes required for Vi antigen expression . 
Transcription of pil occurs only in the late logarithmic and stationary phases of bacterial growth while viaB expression occurs in the logarithmic growth phase . 
Expression of both viaB and pil was , however , optimal at 100 mM NaCl , and mutations in envZ/ompR , rcsB/rcsC , ( but not rcsA ) , tviA , ihfB or ﬁs affected transcription of both viaB and pil DNA . 
As both Vi antigen and Type IVB pili facilitate serovar Typhi invasion of human monocytes , an overlap of production controls is logical . 
It appears that Vi antigen synthesis precedes pilus production .

Introduction
Among salmonella strains , the Vi capsular antigen is synthesized by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C. Genes required for Vi antigen biosynthesis ( the viaB gene cluster ) are transcribed by serovar Typhi inside human macrophages ( Daigle et al. , 2001 ) and expression of the Vi antigen is important ( although not essential ) for bacterial survival in such cells ( Hirose et al. , 1997 ) . 
Control of viaB gene expression has been well studied . 
The RcsB protein acts in concert with TviA protein , encoded by the ﬁrst gene of the viaB locus , to activate viaB transcription from the tviA promoter ( Virlo-geux et al. , 1996 ) . 
Expression of the Vi antigen in serovar Typhi is also dependent upon a functional ompR/envZ regulatory system ( Pickard et al. , 1994 ) . 
Higher osmolarity inhibited cotranscription of the tviAB genes required for Vi antigen synthesis , and Vi antigen synthesis was strongly inhibited at a salt level of 300 mM ( Arricau et al. , 1998 ) . 
Vi antigen is synthesized during the logarithmic phase of growth ( Arricau et al. , 1998 ) . 
We have earlier suggested that type IVB pili expressed by serovar Typhi may contribute to bacterial virulence ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) . 
The serovar Typhi pil operon is located in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 7 ( SPI7 ) , which also carries the viaB gene cluster mentioned above ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
Pili encoded by the pil operon mediate bacterial selfassociation , but only when the presumptive minor pilus proteins PilV1 and PilV2 are not expressed ( Morris et al. , 2003 ) . 
Apart from playing a role in bacterial self-association , the pil operon may also be important in mediating attachment of invading bacteria to eukaryotic cells during infection . 
The type IVB structural pilin , PilS , binds to the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) , the recognized eukaryotic cell receptor for serovar Typhi ( Pier et al. , 1998 ; Lyczak & Pier , 2002 ; Tsui et al. , 2003 ) . 
Such binding may precede a more intimate association between CFTR and bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( Lyczak & Pier , 
2002 ) . 
An association of PilS with a eukaryotic cell surface receptor may be important not only in facilitating the entry of serovar Typhi into intestinal epithelial cells ( Tsui et al. , 2003 ) but also into human monocytes after bacterial penetration of the gut epithelium . 
Piliated serovar Typhi stimulated protein kinase C activity , interleukin 6 production , and nuclear transcription factor NF-kB synthesis in human monocytic THP-1 cells to extents greater than those seen with the control pil-negative strain ( Wang et al. , 2005 ) . 
A 12-residue peptide selected , using a ribosome display system , to bind to PilS , afforded 75 % inhibition of piliated serovar Typhi entry to human monocytic THP-1 cells when used at 6 mM , while a control peptide was without effect , and neither peptide inhibited THP-1 cell invasion by a nonpiliated strain of serovar Typhi ( Wu et al. , 2005 ) . 
Also , a 71 nt RNA aptamer , obtained by systematic evolution using exponential enrichment , inhibited ( 71 -- 74 % ) serovar Typhi entry into THP-1 cells , although the same aptamer also showed a nonspeciﬁc inhibition ( 19 -- 33 % ) of the THP-1 cell entry of a pilS mutant ( Pan et al. , 2005 ) . 
To date , controls ( such as growth phase , osmolarity , or genetic regulation ) on expression of the serovar Typhi pil operon have not been investigated . 
Of particular interest is whether any pil control elements are shared with those regulating expression of the Vi antigen . 
Coregulation of pilus production with Vi antigen expression would perhaps be expected if both extracellular structures were important in virulence . 
In this paper , we examine this question . 
Materials and methods
Materials and DNA manipulation
Reagents were of Molecular Biology grade . 
Enzymes active on DNA were obtained from either Invitrogen or Roche and were used as directed by the suppliers . 
Anti-Vi antiserum was from Becton , Dickinson & Co. ( Sparks , MD ) . 
Catechol was from Aldrich Inc. . 
Molecular biology techniques followed the methods of Sambrook et al. ( 1989 ) . 
Media, bacterial strains and plasmids
Luria -- Bertani broth ( LB ) was prepared as described by Miller ( 1972 ) and contained 10 g tryptone L and 5 g 1 yeast extract L . 
Salt was added to 100 mM unless other 1 salt levels are explicitly indicated . 
Solid medium contained 1.5 % ( w/v ) agar . 
Antibiotics were added , when appropriate , to 30 mg mL 1 ( chloramphenicol ) , 50 mg mL 1 ( Km ) , 100 mg mL 1 ( ampicillin ) , 10 mg mL 1 ( tetracycline ) , or 20 mg mL 1 ( trimethoprim ) . 
Serovar Typhi J341 ( Ty2 Vi ) ( Zhang et al. , 1997 ) is the basic strain used in most of the work of this paper . 
Serovar Typhi Ty2 ( Vi ) was obtained from the Salmonella Genetic 1 Stock Center at the University of Calgary , Canada . 
Escher-ichia coli K-12 DH5a [ supE44 , DlacU169 , ( f80 lacZDM15 ) , hsdR17 , recA1 , endA1 , gyrA96 ( nalidixic acid ) , thi-1 , relA1 ] R was the usual host for recombinant plasmids . 
The xylE gene was obtained by PCR from pCM20 ( Marx & Lidstrom , 2001 ) . 
The kanamycin-resistance ( Km ) cassette , containing R a Km gene of 816 bp , is derived from plasmid pUC4K R ( Pharmacia Biotechnology ) . 
The chloramphenicol-resistance cassette is 1384 bp long and contains a chloramphenicolresistance gene of 660 bp ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) . 
We made two reporter strains in the background of serovar Typhi J341 . 
For the ﬁrst ( termed the ` pil Transcription Reporter ' ) , examining control of pil transcription , the xylE gene ( 924 bp , in a cassette of 966 bp ) , followed by the trpA terminator ( 29 bp , in a fragment of 37 bp ) and the chlor-amphenicol-resistance cassette ( to permit selection of the insertion mutant ) was inserted downstream of the pil promoter , just upstream of the pilL gene with which the pil operon commences . 
The insertion begins after nt 7044 of GenBank AF000001 and pilL sequence recommences at AF000001 nt 7072 . 
The size of the insertion is 2387 bp . 
We created mutations in regulatory genes in the background of the pil Transcription Reporter , to measure effects on pil transcription . 
In the remainder of this subsection , all numbered nucleotides refer to GenBank submission NC_004631 ( serovar Typhi Ty2 complete sequence ) . 
To make a mutation in ompR/envZ , bases 4155629 -- 4156230 , 4156916 -- 4156981 , and 4155259 -- 4155632 were removed , and a Km cassette replaced nts 4155259 -- 4156230 . 
For the R rcsB/rcsC mutation , nts 674170 -- 676360 , 676838 -- 677016 , and 677119 -- 677353 were eliminated , and a Km cassette R replaced nts 676838 -- 677353 . 
A tviA mutation was a simple insertion of a Km cassette between nts 4507211 -- 4507212 . 
R The rpoS mutation involved the removal of nts 2900774 -- 2900807 and 2901451 -- 2901480 with a Km casR sette replacing nts 2901451 -- 2901480 . 
Finally , the rcsA mutation was a simple insertion of a Km cassette between nts R 
995102 and 995103 . 
The XylE assay , using culture sonicates , has been described ( Tam et al. , 2005 ) . 
An OD600 nm level of 1.0 was taken to indicate that the culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth . 
OD600 nm values of 1.5 or 1.8 reﬂected cultures in the late logarithmic or stationary phases of growth , respectively . 
Levels of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were measured . 
Enzyme units are expressed as pmol 2-hydroxy-muconic semialdehyde produced min 1 mg 1 protein . 
The pil Transcription Reporter routinely yielded values of 10 -- 12 U , when grown to stationary phase in medium containing 100 mM NaCl . 
A Bio-Rad protein assay kit was used for estimation of protein concentration . 
A pUC19-based plasmid which efﬁciently complemented a serovar Typhi chromosomal ompR/envZ mutation contained a 2106 bp fragment from nt 4154896 to nt 4157001 , encoding , sequentially , the ompR and envZ genes . 
A trpA terminator followed . 
In a strain , we term the Vi Control Reporter , the natural thyA gene was inactivated by insertion of a 1272 bp tetra-cycline-resistance cassette , containing a 1191 bp tetracy-cline-resistance gene ( produced by PCR from plasmid pBR322 ) , between nts 3000410 and 3000411 . 
Then , the E. coli thyA gene , a trpA terminator , and a chloramphenicolresistance cassette were inserted simultaneously , on a 2266 bp DNA fragment , between nts 4506642 and 4506726 . 
This placed thyA under the control of the tviA promoter . 
Further , the tviA gene was preserved intact , as efﬁcient tviA promoter activity requires functional TviA protein ( see Results ) . 
We created mutations in regulatory genes in the background of the Vi Control Reporter , to measure effects on viaB transcription . 
These mutations were also inserted into the background of the pil Transcription Reporter , in order to measure effects of such mutations on pil transcription . 
The serovar Typhi ﬁs gene was interrupted between nts 
3395371 and 3395372 by insertion of a 1244 bp DNA fragment carrying a Km cassette . 
The ihfB gene was R interrupted between nts 2002809 and 2002810 with a DNA fragment of 1256 bp , again including a Km cassette . 
R 
A new method for the selection of positive regulatory genes
In the Vi Control Reporter strain described above , transcription of the thyA gene is under the control of the tviA promoter . 
When this strain was subjected to random transposome mutagenesis , using the EZ : : Tn5 o R6Kgori / Kan-2 4 Trp kit ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) we obtained insertions ( Km ) at the frequency reported for experiments R using serovar Typhimurium . 
Thus , we obtained 4 104 insertions mL 1 of transposome preparation . 
When a pool of transposome-induced mutants was plated in the presence of both Km and trimethoprim , and with thymine ( 50 mg mL 1 ) , strains unable to transcribe the thyA gene were selected . 
After overnight growth at 37 1C , eight mutants had formed visible colonies . 
The transposon insertions were rescued as plasmids and sequencing conﬁrmed that these initial mutations were all in the thyA or tviA genes . 
The strains were discarded . 
After 48 h of incubation , two slowergrowing colonies appeared on the plate . 
These contained transposon insertions in the ihfB and ﬁs genes ( one strain of each ) , and we proceeded to show that mutations in these genes negatively affected the transcription of both the viaB gene cluster and pil . 
We make the point here that this approach may be applied to the identiﬁcation of genes which positively regulate a gene of interest , provided that the gene of interest is expressed in the logarithmic phase of growth ( so that ThyA is made at a growth stage permitting killing of thyA cells , on plates , by trimethoprim ) . 
We were 1 unable to perform the reverse experiment ( selection of mutations negatively affecting pil transcription , and then asking if these mutations inﬂuenced viaB activity ) as pil is 
transcribed only in the stationary phase of growth . 
Results
Growth phase, osmotic, and genetic regulation of pil transcription
We placed a xylE reporter gene just before the ﬁrst gene ( pilL ) of the pil operon ( see Materials and methods ) and initially showed that pil transcription begins only in late logarithmic growth and is optimal in the stationary phase ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Although serovar Typhi Ty2 carries a mutation in the rpoS gene , encoding a stationary phase-speciﬁc s factor ( Robbe-Saule & Norel , 1999 ) , the serovar Typhi RpoS protein still carries 311 aa residues of the wild-type 330 aa sequence . 
We made a major deletion in rpoS ( see Materials and methods ) and conﬁrmed that this mutation , in the reporter strain background , was without effect on pil transcription ( data not shown ) . 
Transcription of pil was optimal in medium with 100 mM NaCl , and was shut off at a NaCl concentration of 300 mM ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The pH of the medium , when buffered in the range pH 5 -- 8 with phosphate , did not affect pil transcription ( data not shown ) . 
We next used insertions of Km cassettes to independently R inactivate a total of 10 known regulatory genes in the reporter strain background ( details of some constructs are in Materials and methods ) . 
Of these insertion mutations seven ( in the fur , oxyR , phoP/phoQ , pmrA/pmrB , sirA , slyA , and ssrA/ssrB genes ) had no effect on pil transcription and will not be further discussed . 
The pil operon transcription is controlled by both the ompR/envZ ( Pickard et al. , 1994 ) and rcsB/rcsC ( Gottesman & Stout , 1991 ) two-component regulatory systems , and tviA ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The ompR/envZ mutation reduced pil transcription by 86 % and was complemented by wild-type ompR/envZ on a multicopy plasmid ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The rcsB/rcsC mutation lowered pil transcription by 84 % . 
We experienced difﬁculty in complementation of the mutation with wild-type rcsB/rcsC DNA on plasmids of either high or low copy number , possibly because the control of rcsB/rcsC expression from plasmids is distinct from that operating on chromosomal rcsB/rcsC . 
Therefore , we made several entirely independent rcsB/rcsC mutations in the reporter strain background and showed that all showed similar inhibition of pil transcription . 
Data from two such mutations are shown ( Fig. 1a ) . 
We expected that a mutation in rcsA would also inhibit pil transcription as RcsB usually partners with RcsA protein to form a functional transcription factor ( Gottesman & Stout , 1991 ; Stout et al. , 1991 ) . 
An inactivating mutation in rcsA ( see Materials and methods ) , however , was without effect on pil transcription ( data not shown ) . 
It is known that RcsB also interacts with TviA protein , encoded by the ﬁrst gene of the viaB locus , to activate viaB transcription from the tviA promoter ( Virlo-geux et al. , 1996 ) . 
We therefore inactivated the tviA gene in the reporter strain background , and observed a 50 % drop in pil transcription ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Again , we could not effectively complement our ﬁrst tviA mutation with a plasmid-borne wild-type tviA gene , even though we used plasmids of varying copy number . 
We therefore made several completely independent tviA mutants in the reporter strain background and showed that all such mutants showed similar reductions in pil transcription . 
Data from two such mutants are shown ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The reduction in pil transcription activity afforded by the tviA mutations was not as great as the effects noted with mutations in ompR/envZ or rcsB/rcsC , but was still signiﬁcant , and suggests that RcsB may optimally complex with TviA to facilitate transcription of pil , although we can not exclude the possibility that a viaB gene distal to tviA is involved in the interaction with RcsB .

( a ) Transcription of serovar Typhi pil is affected by growth phase , NaCl concentration , and mutations in ompR/envZ , rcsB/rcsC , and tviA . 
A xylE reporter gene was placed downstream of the pil promoter , just upstream of pilL , the ﬁrst gene in the pil operon , and XylE levels were assayed . 
The details 
are in the text . 
( b ) Mutations in ﬁs and ihfB affect pil transcription when bacteria are grown under stress . 
Growth conditions are indicated . 
Nb , novobiocin . 
For all tests except those exploring the inﬂuence of NaCl level on pil transcription , bacteria were grown in medium with 100 mM NaCl . 
For 
all tests except those examining growth phase inﬂuences on pil expression , bacteria were grown for 16 h to stationary phase . 
The growth rates of all strains were similar . 
In both ( a ) and ( b ) , black bars refer to data obtained from bacteria with the xylE reporter gene but otherwise wild type . 
White bars in 
( a ) , and patterned bars in ( b ) , indicate data obtained from bacteria with both the xylE reporter gene and a further mutation ( identiﬁed in the Figure ) . 
The small grey bar in ( a ) is the negative control , indicating the XylE level measured from a wild-type strain lacking the reporter gene . 
All assays were 
performed at least ﬁve times , in triplicate . 
Averages and standard deviations are shown . 
The wild-type strain routinely yielded values of 10 -- 12 enzyme units , when grown to stationary phase in medium containing 100 mM NaCl . 
These values are normalized in each series of experiments . 
Next , we repeated all assays described in the above paragraph but with cells in the logarithmic phase of growth . 
No activity was seen in any case . 
The observations that pil operon expression requires transcription factors encoded by the ompR , rcsB , and tviA genes , and that pil transcription is inhibited by high salt levels , is strongly reminiscent of controls affecting Vi antigen biosynthesis . 
As mentioned above , RcsB and TviA proteins complex to activate viaB transcription from the tviA promoter . 
Expression of the Vi antigen in serovar Typhi also requires a viable ompR/envZ regulatory system ( Pickard et al. , 1994 ) . 
Higher osmolarity inhibited cotranscription of the tviAB genes , required for Vi antigen synthesis , and very little Vi antigen was synthesized at a salt level of 300 mM ( Arricau et al. , 1998 ) . 
A difference between controls on Vi antigen expression , on the one hand , and constraints on pil transcription , on the other , is that Vi antigen is synthesized during the logarithmic phase of growth ( Arricau et al. , 1998 ) while pil transcription occurs almost exclusively in stationary phase ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Selection of other mutations affecting transcription of viaB genes
We decided to select for other regulatory genes required for viaB transcription and to ask if mutations in such genes might affect not only Vi antigen production , but also pil transcription . 
We developed a novel method ( see Materials and methods ) to select for mutants in regulatory genes which are positive effectors of a gene or gene cluster normally transcribed in the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth . 
Brieﬂy , we placed the thyA gene under the control of the tviA promoter , which acts to transcribe the viaB gene cluster , and also inactivated the natural thyA gene of the bacterial strain . 
We then subjected this reporter strain ( which we term the Vi Control Reporter in Materials and methods ) to random transposon mutagenesis and selected for mutants capable of growth on solid medium containing trimethoprim . 
The rationale is that thyA cells will grow on trimethoprim-containing plates as tetrahydrofolate drain is minimal in such mutants and inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by trimethoprim does not kill the cells . 
Trimethoprim is lethal in thyA cells . 
Therefore , bacterial colonies 1 growing on the selection plates may be mutant in genes which are positive regulators of the tviA promoter . 
We identiﬁed mutations in both the ihfB and ﬁs genes and conﬁrmed that such mutations affected tviA promoter activity ﬁrst by showing that deﬁned ihfB and ﬁs mutants , in the Vi Control Reporter background , grew slowly ( at a rate about half that of a thyA control ) on trimethoprimcontaining plates but were ultimately resistant to the drug at 20 mg mL 1 in solid medium . 
The Vi Control Reporter strain was killed at this trimethoprim level . 
Next , we recombined the deﬁned ihfB and ﬁs mutations into a serovar Typhi Ty2 ( Vi ) background and showed , by slide 1 agglutination with anti-Vi antiserum , that the mutants still retained some ability to be agglutinated . 
This indicated that the ihfB and ﬁs mutations did not completely eliminate Vi antigen production . 
The ihfB gene encodes the HimD or IhfB ( integration host factor b-subunit ) , which binds to and bends DNA in a manner affecting the activities of promoters ( Paul et al. , 2001 ) . 
The ﬁs gene encodes a factor for inversion stimulation , a DNA binding protein involved in growth phase-dependent regulation ( Sheikh et al. , 2001 ) . 
We then asked if ihfB or ﬁs mutations might affect transcription of pil , as evidenced by inhibition of XylE activity in the reporter strain in which xylE is located just upstream of pilL . 
Under optimal growth conditions ( 100 mM NaCl , no added novobiocin ) , neither the ihfB nor the ﬁs mutation affected pil transcription . 
When the NaCl levels were raised , however , or when novobiocin ( 25 mg mL 1 ) was added to the growth medium , both the ihfB and the ﬁs mutations negatively affected pil transcription activities ( Fig. 1b ) . 
Growth in 170 mM NaCl , 250 mM NaCl , or 25 mg mL 1 novobiocin reduced pil transcription in a ﬁs mutant by 0 % , 26 % , and 23 % , respectively , compared with transcription levels seen in the unmodiﬁed reporter strain ( Fig. 1b ) . 
The corresponding ﬁgures for the ihfB mutant were 27 % , 51 % , and 55 % ( Fig. 1b ) . 
The observation that mutations selected for inhibition of tviA transcription also served to inhibit pil transcription provides strong evidence that synthesis of the Vi antigen and the type IVB pili share controls on expression .

Discussion
The SPI7 DNA of serovar Typhi contains both the viaB gene cluster , required for biosynthesis of Vi capsular antigen , and 
DNA encompassing the pil operon . 
A role for pil in typhoid fever pathogenesis has not yet been demonstrated by administration of a pilS mutant of serovar Typhi to human volunteers . 
We earlier showed that pilS mutants of serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin were defective in entry to human INT407 cells in culture ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ; Morris et al. , 2003 ) . 
Recently , Pan et al. ( 2005 ) showed that entry of piliated serovar Typhi into human monocytic THP-1 cells was reduced by 93 -- 94 % when the strains were examined singly . 
As piliated serovar Typhi may enmesh nonpiliated bacteria ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) it is likely that our earlier INT407 cell entry tests using bacterial mixtures which included positive control strains overestimated the invasive capacities of admixed nonpiliated mutants . 
Expression of the Vi antigen assists serovar Typhi to survive in human macrophages ( Hirose et al. , 1997 ; Daigle et al. , 2001 ) . 
Expression of the Type IVB pili is also important in this context . 
Piliated serovar Typhi entered human monocytes to a level 14-fold greater than that shown by an otherwise isogenic pil mutant ( Pan et al. , 2005 ) . 
Small molecules ( a peptide , and an RNA aptamer ) selected for afﬁnity to PilS ( the pilin ) by ligand enrichment techniques , inhibited the entry of piliated serovar Typhi into human monocytes , while the entry of the otherwise isogenic pil mutant was either not affected ( Wu et al. , 2005 ) or less affected ( Pan et al. , 2005 ) . 
It is therefore logical that expression of the Vi antigen and the Type IVB pili should be coregulated . 
As the Vi antigen is made in the logarithmic phase of growth , and the Type IVB pili only in the stationary phase , it may be that a two-step process is involved in macrophage entry of serovar Typhi . 
The Vi antigen is ﬁrst synthesized as armour to protect the bacterium against damage after macrophage entry . 
The pili are then made to facilitate such entry . 
Either or both CFTR binding and bacterial self-association may be useful to assist macrophage invasion by serovar Typhi .
