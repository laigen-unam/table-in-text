Abstract 
This study describes the potential use of attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains to express and deliver VP1 of entero-virus 71 ( EV71 ) as a vaccination strategy to prevent EV71 infection in mice . 
When orally administered to BALB/c mice , both attenuated carrier strains , CNP101 and SL7207 , were able to efﬁciently invade livers and spleens , while only the virulence plasmid-carrying strain SL7207 persisted for more than 30 days in these organs . 
A recombinant in vivo-regulated promoter expression plasmid expressing VP1 antigen of EV71 was constructed . 
The expression of the VP1 , directed by the pagC promoter , in attenuated Salmonella was conﬁrmed by Western blot hybridization . 
Both humoral and cellular immune responses were elicited in mice by oral immunization with such Salmonella-based VP1 vaccines . 
We evaluated the protective efﬁcacy of the vaccines in mice using a maternal immunization protocol . 
With a lethal challenge , ICR newborn mice born to dams immunized with Salmonella-based VP1 vaccine showed a 50e60 % survival ; in contrast , none of the mice in the control group survived the challenge . 
Our data indicated that Salmonella-based VP1 subunit vaccines are a promising vaccine strategy in the prevention of EV71 infection .

Introduction 
Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is a human enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family . 
Since its ﬁrst reporting in 1974 [ 1 ] , several large outbreaks of EV71 infection have been reported , including hand , foot and mouth disease [ 2 ] , polio-like paralysis [ 3,4 ] , and fatal encephalitis with cardiopulmonary complication [ 4 ] . 
EV71 appears to be emerging as an increasingly important virulent neurotropic enterovirus in the upcoming era of poliomy-elitis eradication [ 5 ] . 
Since no effective antiviral agents are available ( pleconaril is not effective ) , developing vaccines for primary prevention is considered to be the best choice among control strategies against EV71 . 
Attenuated Salmonella has been proposed as a useful vector to carry protective antigens of other pathogens to make hybrid vaccine strains . 
The potential advantage of an oral Salmonella vaccine vector , compared to other vaccine vectors such as vaccinia virus , is that Salmonella replicates and potentially expresses the heterologous antigen in the intestine , thereby delivering the antigen to the mucosal immune system , where local humoral and cellular responses are vigorously stimulated . 
Furthermore , most of the Salmonella vaccine strains retain a limited ability to invade the internal lymphoid organs , such as liver and spleendsufﬁcient induction of systemic immunity therefore can be expected . 
Several methods have been used to obtain an attenuated strain of Salmonella without impairing immunogenicity , including mutations altering synthesis of amino acids and gene expression [ 6,7 ] . 
For example , aroA-deletion mutants of Salmonella enterica serova

Typhimurium were found to be avirulent and immunogenic in mice and were excellent live oral vaccines against murine sal-monellosis [ 8e10 ] . 
However , attenuation by only one single or two related phenotypical markers does not provide sufﬁcient safety against vaccination-related complications . 
Practically , two independently phenotypical attenuating markers are necessary to ensure full stability on account of potentiating single frequencies of back mutation [ 11,12 ] , although certain onemarker mutants still exhibit good stability . 
Enteroviruses are shed in the feces of patients for weeks after primary infection . 
A direct fecaleoral mechanism of transmission has been postulated . 
Gastrointestinal tract appears to be the portal of entry shared by both enteroviruses and Salmonella . 
In this study , we aimed to devise an oral Salmonella-based EV71 vaccine . 
We used two S. Typhimurium auxotrophic mutants , SL7207 and CNP101 , as vector strains to express a viral capsid protein , VP1 , of EV71 and analyzed the immunogenicity and efﬁcacy of the vaccine strains in the protection of EV71 infection in mice . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial and viral strains
Strain 2272 of EV71 was isolated from the autopsied specimen of the spinal cord of an 8-year-old child . 
The virus , propagated in rhobdomyosarcoma cells ( RD ) using DMEM with 2 % serum , was used as the prototype virus for all experiments , including challenge test , in this study . 
On the other hand , the virus titer was determined as TCID50 on Vero cells based on an observation of a typical cytopathic effect ( CPE ) produced by viral infection . 
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection . 
One of the S. Typhimurium strains used in this study was the auxotrophic aroA mutant SL7207 [ 13 ] that contained a 90-kb virulence plasmid ( pSTV ) . 
The other auxotrophic strain , CNP101 , is an attenuated strain of which LD50 is 10 9 bacteria that is at the level of avirulence . 
Yet , it retains the ability to invade liver and spleen and survive in mice for a few days . 
This attenuated strain is constructed and kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan T. Ou , Chang Gung University , Taiwan ( USA patent 6207167 ) . 
CNP101 is a derivative of C5 , a wild-type , virulence plasmid-carrying strain , with an LD50 of < 500 bacteria to mice . 
The virulence plasmid-cured CNP101 is defective with regard to its ability to utilize amino acids . 
CNP101 can not grow in minimal medium , but grows well with the supply of casein hydrolysates . 
There are several possible explanations for the auxotrophy : one is the inadequate transport and the other , the degradative pathways may be poorly expressed or defective . 
The genetic information for the auxotrophy in CNP101 remains absent . 
2.2. Construction of plasmids
Total DNA-free RNA was extracted from the prototype EV71 2272-infected cells using TRIzol reagent-chloroform ( GibcoBRL ) extraction as described earlier [ 14 ] . 
The concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically at 260/280 nm and quality as assessed by visualization on an ethidium stained agarose gel . 
RT-PCR for cDNA synthesis and ampliﬁcation was performed in a single step by adding RNA template and primers to RT-PCR beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Buckinghamshire , UK ) containing MmuLV reverse transcriptase , RNase inhibitor , buffer , nucleo-tides , and taq polymerase . 
Two PCR oligodeoxynucleotide primers were synthesized as described earlier [ 14 ] ; however , an NcoI and a HindIII restriction endonuclease site were introduced to allow ligation of the entire VP1 cDNA into pKK233-2 , a prokaryotic expression vector with Salmonella-speciﬁc in vivo-regulated promoter [ 15 ] ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The constructed plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli DH5a by transformation . 
The plasmid DNA was extracted and puriﬁed by the CsCl gradient method described earlier [ 16 ] . 
Veriﬁcation of the inserted viral VP1 sequence was performed using the automated dideoxynucleotide chain termination method ( ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit , Perkin Elmer Inc. , CA ) . 
Furthermore , the puriﬁed plasmid DNA was introduced into S. Typhimurium SL7207 and CNP101 by electroporation , and the transformants that harbored the constructed plasmid were used in subsequent experiments as vaccine strains . 
2.3. Expression of VP1 by attenuated S. Typhimurium
Approximately 1 10 bacterial cells from an overnight 6 culture were harvested by centrifugation . 
The pelleted cells were sonicated on ice , and the insoluble proteins were recovered by centrifugation . 
The insoluble fraction of the whole cell proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 12.5 % acrylamide gels ) and transferred to a PVDF membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) by electroblotting . 
The blotted PVDF membrane was incubated in a blotting solution ( Tris-buffered saline , 1 % Tween 20 , 1 % gelatin , 5 % skim milk ) , Western blot hybrid-ization was performed with mouse anti-EV71 polyclonal antibody ( Chemicon International Inc. , Temecula , CA ) , and bound antibody was detected using the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse IgG ( Biogenesis Inc. , Sandon , NH ) . 
2.4. Comparison of the S. Typhimurium carrier strains SL7207 and CNP101
The major difference between the two auxotrophic S. Typhimurium strains is that SL7207 , but not CNP101 , harbors pSTV . 
A Tn5-tagged pSTV ( CK1-1 ) was reintroduced into CNP101 [ 16 ] . 
The insertion site of Tn5 in CK1-1 is at the transfer region , which is outside the known virulence region ( spv operon ) of pSTV [ 16 ] . 
CNP101 did not regain the high virulence of its parental strain by acquiring CK1-1 , as determined by a mouse virulence test ( LD50 1/4 10 e10 bacteria ) . 
8 9 For infection of mice , bacterial inocula were prepared by seeding ﬁve colonies of each S. Typhimurium strain into Luria broth ( L broth ) and allowing them to grow overnight a 
37 C without shaking . 
Adult female BALB/c mice in groups of 12 were immunized orally via a 4-cm gastric lavage needle with approximately 10 bacteria ( 100 ml/mouse ) . 
Thirty min-8 utes prior to oral inoculation , mice were administered 100 ml of 10 % sodium bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acidity . 
At predetermined time points after infection , mice were euthanized , and their spleens and livers were excised aseptically . 
Each organ sample was placed in 5 ml gelatin 1 % - Hanks 's Balanced Salts Solution ( GibcoBRL ) , homogenized , diluted serially and inoculated onto L agar plates . 
Viable bacterial counts were determined after incubation at 37 C for 24 h. Experiments were repeated three times . 
2.5. Immunization of mice
Adult female BALB/c mice in groups of 12 were immunized orally with approximately 10 bacteria ( 100 ml/mouse ) 8 previously grown at 37 C without shaking . 
Prior to immuni-zation , mice were administered 100 ml of 10 % sodium bicarbonate . 
Mice were boosted with the same dose of bacteria at days 7 and 14 . 
Three control groups were immunized orally with a Salmonella carrier strain SL7207 , EV71 strain 2272 , and normal saline , respectively . 
Four mice of each group were sacriﬁced 1 , 2 , and 3 months after the ﬁnal immunization and serum sample was collected for neutralization assay . 
Livers and spleens of the sacriﬁced mice at each time point were removed , homogenized aseptically , and plated on LB agar containing an antibiotic for selection . 
When the growth of Salmonella was assured , at least 10 colonies of the bacteria were randomly selected and examined by an alkaline lysis method for the presence of the recombinant plasmid [ 16 ] . 
The immunization experiment was repeated twice . 
2.6. Neutralization antibody assay
The neutralization test was carried out by a 50 % TCID50 reduction assay in Vero cells [ 17 ] . 
All serum samples were tested in triplicate and with a two-fold serial dilution . 
The diluted serum was incubated at 56 C for 30 min to inactivate the complement before mixing with equal volumes of virus containing 10 TCID50 , and then the mixture of virus and se-2 rum was added to monolayer of Vero cells in 96-well plates . 
After 3 days of growth , the titer was read as the highest dilution that resulted in less than 50 % CPE . 
In case the difference between triplicates was greater than two-fold , the assay was repeated . 
2.7. Delayed-type hypersensitivity test
Cellular immunity of mice to the immunization was evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity test [ 18 ] . 
One month after immunization with vaccines , heat-killed > 10 TCID50 7 ( 25 ml ) virus was injected into the footpad of the immunized mouse , and the thickening of the pad was measured 24 , 48 , and 72 h later . 
Mice inoculated with EV71 , CNP101 , and normal saline were used as controls . 
2.8. Protection test
EV71 infection caused no apparent clinical symptoms in adult BALB/c ; however , in ICR newborn mice , EV71 infection resulted in hind limb paralysis and eventual death within 10 days post-viral challenge [ 19 ] . 
For maternal immunization , adult female mice were orally administered with Salmonella-based EV71 vaccine ( 10 CFU ) three times at a 1-wee 7 interval . 
Controls consisted of one group of mice orally immunized with the carrier strain SL7202 and the other subcutane-ously injected with inactivated EV71 strain 2272 [ 19 ] . 
Seven days after the ﬁnal immunization , the animals were allowed to mate . 
The ICR newborn mice were challenged at 24 h of age with the EV71 strain 2272 by intraperitoneal injection . 
The mice were observed daily for eventual mortality . 
The percentage survival rate of the mice in each group was recorded for 2 weeks .

The VP1 gene of EV71 was ampliﬁed by a pair of primers designed based on EV71 strain 2272 . 
The RT-PCR amplicon was inserted into pKK233-2 as expression cassette for recombinant VP1 protein . 
The Salmonella-speciﬁc in vivo-regulated promoter , ppagC , was used in this plasmid ( pKK233-2-VP1 ) to drive the expression of the insert gene . 
Cell lysates of S. Typhimurium strains CNP101 and SL2272 and E. coli DH5a transformed with pKK233-2-VP1 were further separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane before binding with EV71 polyclonal antibody .

2.9. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of differences between groups were performed by using the c test or Student 's t test . 
A difference 2 was considered statistically signiﬁcant with a P value less than 0.05 . 
3. Results
3.1. Expression of EV71 VP1 protein
The recombinant VP1 protein expression was determined in E. coli DH5a and S. Typhimurium strains CNP101 and SL7207 transformed with the pKK233-2-VP1 by Western blot hybridization . 
A protein of approximately 40 kDa corresponding to VP1 was detected in CNP101 and SL7207 that harbored the recombinant plasmid and was absent in CNP101 alone or E. coli containing the plasmid ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Previous studies showed that MgCl2 concentration affected the expression of the reporter gene by the pagC promoter in the plasmid pKK233-2 [ 15 ] ; however , we found in this study that the addition of 0.01 mM and 0.1 mM MgCl2 to the culture medium did not signiﬁcantly increase the expression of VP1 in Salmonella ( Fig. 1B ) . 
To examine the stability of plasmid pKK233-2-VP1 in Salmonella SL7207 and CNP101 in vitro , SL7207 and CNP101 cells containing pKK233-2-VP1 were cultured with daily passage of 1:1000 dilutions for 5 consecutive days in L broth . 
All SL7207 and CNP101 cells examined ( 20 clones for each strain daily ) kept pKK233-2-VP1 , indicating that the recombinant plasmid was very stable in these vaccine carrier strains . 
Bacterial cells obtained from the last-day culture of the stability test expressed VP1 readily ( data not shown ) , suggesting stable expression of VP1 without rearrangements . 
3.2. In vivo persistence of auxotrophic S. Typhimurium strains in mouse organs
To investigate and compare the ability of the two auxotro-phic S. Typhimurium carrier strains to invade and persist in organs of mice , groups of mice were orally infected and the number of bacteria recovered from livers and spleens were determined at different time points . 
The results showed that both strains were able to efﬁciently invade into livers and spleens following oral inoculation ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The pSTV-carrying SL7207 , but not CNP101 , persisted for more than 30 days in these organs . 
Such long-term persistence phenotype was restored in CNP101 , when CNP101 was introduced with a virulence plasmid , CK1-1 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The vaccine strains showed similar invasion and persistence phenotype to the original carrier strains ( Fig. 2 ) . 
3.3. Antibody responses generated in mice orally immunized with attenuated S. Typhimurium expressing VP1
Immunogenicity of the vaccines was evaluated in BALB/c mice by in vitro neutralization assay . 
The assay detects only antibody capable of blocking virus entry into the host cell . 
As shown in the result , all the mice immunized with either CNP101 - or SL7207-based vaccine showed a signiﬁcant rise in the neutralization titer in comparison to the control mice at 1 and 2 months post-immunization ( Table 1 ) . 
Interestingly , the neutralization titers induced by SL7207 - , rather than CNP101-based , VP1 vaccine maintained up to 3 months post-immunization in some mice . 
In accordance with the in vi-tro result , all cells , either CNP101 or SL7207 , recovered from the organs of immunized mice at different time intervals contained the recombinant plasmid pKK233-2-VP1 ( 5e10 clones for each strain per time point ) . 
3.4. Cellular immune response generated in mice orally immunized with attenuated S. Typhimurium expressing VP1
Delayed-type hypersensitivity was used to evaluate the overall cellular immune response generated by the vaccines . 
When 25 ml inactivated virus was used as the skin test reagent , the pad was signiﬁcantly thickened 72 h after the testing in mice previously immunized with EV71 , CNP101/pKK233 -2 - VP1 , and SL7207/pKK233 -2 - VP1 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The thickness of the swollen pads of mice immunized with inactivated EV71 and the two Salmonella-based vaccines was signiﬁcantly different from that of the control group of mice 72 h after the testing ( all P < 0.05 ) . 
3.5. Protection against lethal viral challenge in an ICR newborn mice model
Protection against lethal EV71 infection by the passively transferred maternal antibody from immunized dams was evaluated in newborn ICR mice . 
At a high virus challenge dose of > 10 TCID50 ( 100 ml ) , only the group of suckling mice born 8 to dams that received inactivated virus showed a protective ef-ﬁcacy of 75 % ( 9/12 ) ; Salmonella-based VP1 vaccine failed to provide signiﬁcant protection at the same virus challenge dose ( data not shown ) . 
However , at a reduced challenge virus dose of 10 TCID50 ( 100 ml ) , the protection efﬁcacy was 92 % ( 11 / 7 12 ) ( P < 0.005 versus control ) for the group that received inactivated virus and 50 % ( 5/10 ) ( P 1/4 0.0325 versus control ) and 58 % ( 7/12 ) ( P 1/4 0.005 versus control ) for the groups that received SL7207/pKK233 -2 - VP1 and CNP101/pKK233 -2 - VP1 , respectively ( Fig. 4 ) 
4. Discussion
A number of quite different approaches to stabilize the expression of heterologous antigens in bacterial vaccine vectors have been investigated . 
One of these approaches involves the use of in vivo-inducible promoters . 
Chatﬁeld et al. ﬁrst reported the application of an in vivo-inducible promoter in attenuated S. Typhimurium [ 20 ] . 
A single-dose oral tetanus vaccine was developed based on the expression of C fragment by the nirB promoter in the plasmid pTETnir15 [ 20 ] . 
A range of antigens , and antigens fused to C fragment have been expressed by the nirB promoter , and some of them have induced protective immunity [ 15,20 e22 ] . 
In this study , we successfully used another in vivo-inducible promoter , the pagC promoter , to direct immunogenic levels of heterologous antigen expression in two auxotrophic S. Typhimurium mutants , CNP101 and SL7207 . 
Previously , Hohmann et al. [ 23 ] had used the pagC promoter in an S. Typhimurium vaccine vector and dem-onstrated that protein expression directed from this promoter induced an antibody response against the heterologous antigen , whereas expression from a constitutive promoter did not , even though the constitutive promoter produced a higher amount of heterologous antigen in vitro [ 23 ] . 
Our data are consistent with the ﬁndings of Hohmann et al. [ 23 ] . 
The capacity of the pagC promoter to be induced in vivo may overcome the need for large amounts of constitutively expressed antigen , potentially avoiding protein toxicity and expression construct instability . 
Our data conﬁrm that such promoter cassette may be a useful tool in the future development of Salmonella vaccine vectors . 
For the ﬁrst time , the inﬂuence of the virulence plasmid in the use of attenuated S. Typhimurium as vaccine delivery system was evaluated . 
Both strains examined in this study were able to efﬁciently colonize and invade into liver and spleen ; however , only the strain that carried a virulence plasmid persisted in these organs for more than 30 days . 
Such persistence phenotype may be an advantage for vaccine development . 
The virulence plasmid has been documented as an important factor for S. Typhimurium to cause typhoid-like illness in mice [ 24 ] ; however , it appears it is not involved in the pathogenesis of its infections in humans [ 25 ] . 
In light of this , to construct a highly immunogenic Salmonella-based vaccine for human use , a

b Number in parenthesis , the number of mice whose sera showed neutralization antibody titers over the total number of mice immunized . 
attenuated strain that harbors a virulence plasmid may be a better choice than the plasmidless . 
Previous studies have shown that conventional vaccine preparation using whole virus particles is the choice of vaccine offering the most expedient and effective method for vaccination against EV71 [ 19,26 ] . 
Nevertheless , the potential advantages of subunit vaccines over conventional whole virus vaccines , such as the safety concern , have rendered new demand to query whether the VP1 subunit of picornaviruses is sufﬁcient to elicit adequate protective immunity against viral infections . 
In an earlier study , two VP1 subunit vaccines of EV71 , one administered as a DNA vaccine and the other as a recombinant protein vaccine , elicited a neutralization antibody response in both ICR and BALB/c mice [ 19 ] . 
Although the delivery system is different , our data again provide direct evidence supporting that VP1 of EV71 contains neutralizing epitopes independent of other viral capsid proteins , and pave the way for potential use of VP1 as the backbone antigen for developing subunit vaccines against EV71 . 
The protection of ICR newborn mice reﬂects the efﬁcacy offered by passively transferred maternal antibody . 
Protection offered by cellular immunity , which is the very important arm of immune response against viral infection , could not be studied in the newborn mice model . 
Whether the added cellular immune response elicited by Salmonella-based VP1 vaccine contributes to any signiﬁcant protection effect in natural infection warrants further evaluation with a more appropriate animal model . 
The protection offered by Salmonella-based VP1 vaccines was not corroborated by a relatively low neutralization titer . 
This may be explained by differences in the in vivo and in vi-tro functions of pathogen-speciﬁc immunoglobulin . 
The in vi-tro microneutralization assay measures only the antibody that binds to the functional domains of the viral capsid governing binding and entry to host cells [ 19 ] . 
The in vivo functions of immunoglobulin , that can not be measured by the in vitro neutralization assay , but contribute signiﬁcantly to protection include activating complement cascades , opsonization , and mediating antibody-dependent cytotoxicity . 
The results of our study suggest that the total VP1-speciﬁc antibody along with the cellular immunity , rather than the sole neutralization antibody , would provide a better alternative immunologicalprotective correlate for use in monitoring EV71 vaccine immunogenicity and protection . 
There have been no concluding reports describing the effect of preexisting immunity to the antigen delivery bacteria on the immunogenicity of the Salmonella-based vaccines . 
Many studies showed that prior immunological experience with the delivery vehicle potentiates the subsequent antibody response following oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella [ 27e29 ] . 
We did not speciﬁcally look at this point in this study . 
However , the protective efﬁcacy offered by the Salmonella-based VP1 vaccines constructed appeared not optimal , compared to that by the inactivated virus vaccine [ 19 ] . 
Whether or not the preexisting immunity to the Salmonella vector may inhibit the recall antibody response , thus causing the less effectiveness of these vaccines in mice needs further studies . 
Use of a live recombinant attenuated Salmonella antigen delivery system would be akin to immunization of the individual with a vaccine factory , since production of the protective antigen and its presentation to the immunized individual occur in vivo after immunization . 
This vaccination strategy appeared , at least in mice , to work successfully for EV71 infection . 
Potential problems associated with this strategy , including lack of appropriate animal models and safety considerations for vaccine carriers , require further studies .

One month after immuni-zation with two vaccines EV71 , CNP101 , or normal saline , mice were skin tested with normal saline ( A ) or inactivated EV71 strain 2272 ( B ) . 
The thickening of the pad was measured 24 , 48 , and 72 h after the injection . 
The pad was signiﬁcantly thickened 72 h after the testing in mice previously immunized with EV71 , CNP101/pKK233 -2 - VP1 , and SL7207/pKK233 -2 - VP1 ( B ) .
