transition metal ions ( Silver and Phung , 2005 ; Nies , 2007 ) . 
Cellular damage can result either from overload of essential or beneﬁcial metal ions , such as Fe , Co , Ni , Cu , Mo , Mn and Zn , or from exposure to transition elements with no known biological role , such as Au , Ag , Al , Bi , Cd , Cr , Hg and Pb . 
The main mechanism of defence that bacteria employ to overcome overexposure to transition elements relies on their elimination from the cell by active transport , sequestration and/or enzymatic modiﬁcation to a less toxic form ( Nies , 2007 ; Tottey et al. , 2007 ) . 
In most bacteria , metal efflux is mediated by the co-ordinated action of P-type ATPases , CBA efflux systems and cation diffusion facilitators ( Silver and Phung , 2005 ) . 
For example , in Escherichia coli the copper excess is removed from the cytoplasm by the P-type ATPase CopA , and from the periplasm by the action of the CBA efflux system CusCFBA and the multicopper oxidase CueO ( Outten et al. , 2001 ; Finney and O'Halloran , 2003 ; Franke et al. , 2003 ) . 
CBA efflux systems are tripartite protein complexes that direct efflux of metal ions , xenobiotics or drugs from either the cytoplasm , the inner membrane or the periplasm , across the outer membrane into the extracellular space ( McKeegan et al. , 2003 ; Nies , 2003 ; Eswaran et al. , 2004 ) . 
The inner-membrane protein of the complex , the resistance -- nodulation -- cell division ( RND ) protein , is the central component of the efflux system . 
It mediates the active transport process and determines substrate speciﬁcity ( Nies , 2003 ; Eswaran et al. , 2004 ; HernandezMendoza et al. , 2007 ) . 
The other two components in the complex are the periplasmic membrane-fusion protein ( MFP ) and the outer-membrane factor ( OMF ) . 
During transport , the substrate initially bound to the RND protein is transferred directly to the OMF component for export to the outside ( Nies , 2003 ; Eswaran et al. , 2004 ; Lomovskaya et al. , 2007 ) . 
The MFP protein serves as a linker to attach the RND protein to the OMF , which is anchored in the outer membrane and projects across the periplasm , forming a ` molecular tube ' ( Koronakis et al. , 2000 ; Murakami and Yamaguchi , 2003 ; Eswaran et al. , 2004 ; Lomovskaya et al. , 2007 ) . 
Gram-negative bacteria typically encode more than one tripartite efflux system with broad and often overlapping substrate speciﬁcities , which are required for survival in

Summary 
Salmonella employs a speciﬁc set of proteins that allows it to detect the presence of gold salts in the environment and to mount the appropriate resistance response . 
This includes a P-type ATPase , GolT , and a small cytoplasmic metal binding protein , GolB . 
Their expression is controlled by a MerR-like sensor , GolS , which is highly selective for Au ions . 
Here , we identify a new GolS-controlled operon named gesABC which codes for a CBA efflux system , and establish its role in Au resistance . 
GesABC can also mediate drug resistance when induced by Au in a GolS-dependent manner , in a strain deleted in the main drug transporter acrAB . 
The GolS-controlled transcription of gesABC differs from the other GolS-regulated loci . 
It is activated by gold , but not induced by copper , even in a strain deleted of the main Cu transporter gene copA , which triggers a substantial GolS-dependent induction of golTS and golB . 
We demonstrate that the Au-dependent induction of gesABC transcription requires higher GolS levels than for the other members of the gol regulon . 
This correlates with a divergent GolS operator in the gesABC promoter . 
We propose that the hierarchical induction within the gol regulon allows Salmonella to cope with Aucontaminated environments .

their ecological niches ( Nies , 2003 ; Piddock , 2006a ) . 
Recent studies demonstrated a role of some CBA systems from Salmonella enterica and other Gramnegative bacteria in pathogenesis ( Piddock , 2006b ) . 
Usually , the genes coding for the RND and MFP components are transcriptionally coupled , and occasionally associated with a gene coding for the OMF ( Grkovic et al. , 2002 ; Lomovskaya et al. , 2007 ) . 
Most E. coli RND export-ers cooperate with TolC , the major OMF protein ( Nishino et al. , 2003 ) . 
The only known exception is the Cu-efflux pump CusCFBA , which codes for its own outermembrane component that could not be substituted for TolC ( Franke et al. , 2003 ) . 
By contrast , in the Pseudomo-nas aeruginosa genome , a speciﬁc OMF gene is encoded for every RND gene ( Poole , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbours ﬁve putative CBA efflux systems encoded in its genome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
Four of them , acrAB , acrD , acrEF and mdtABC , also present in E. coli , affect drug resistance and virulence ( Nikaido et al. , 1998 ; Nagakubo et al. , 2002 ; Eaves et al. , 2004 ; Olliver et al. , 2005 ) . 
They all require TolC as the outer-membrane channel ( Nishino et al. , 2003 ) . 
The ﬁfth one is a complete CBA efflux system encoded by a Salmonella-speciﬁc operon composed by STM0352 , STM0351 and STM0350 . 
Deletion of this operon , originally named mdsABC , did not have an effect on Salmonella susceptibility to toxic compounds . 
On the other hand , its overexpression from a multicopy plasmid in a strain deleted of the main efflux system , acrB , confers some degree of resistance to different xenobiotics ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
This Salmonella-speciﬁc CBA efflux-coding operon is located next , but transcribed in the opposite direction to the golTS operon , which encodes for the P-type ATPase GolT and the MerR-like transcriptional regulator GolS ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
We have recently demonstrated that , in the presence of Au ions , GolS induces the transcription of the golTS operon and of golB , a small neighbouring gene which codes for a putative metal binding protein ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
Furthermore , deletion of each individual gene of the gol regulon affects Salmonella resistance to Au ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
[ Although not entirely clariﬁed , Au toxicity could be due to the intracellular reduction to the thiophilic ion Au ( I ) , which interacts with sulphydryl ligands with high affinity ( Hobman et al. , 2007 ) . ] 
Interestingly , the sole deletion of golS renders the most susceptible strain to Au salts , while single or simultaneous deletions of golT and golB display intermediate phenotypes , suggesting the presence of yet unidentiﬁed GolS-regulated loci whose products are involved in Au resistance . 
Here we demonstrate that transcription of the Salmonella-speciﬁc CBA efflux-coding operon ( renamed as gesABC for GolS-induced CBA efflux system-coding operon ) is induced by Au ions in a GolSdependent manner and that it is required for gold 
Results
The Salmonella-speciﬁc CBA efflux system is part of the gol regulon
We have recently demonstrated that the Au sensor GolS induces the expression of GolT and GolB , required for Au resistance in Salmonella . 
However , a strain deleted only in golS was more susceptible to gold salts than a DgolT DgolB double mutant strain ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) , suggesting the presence of other unidentiﬁed GolS-regulated factors involved in Au resistance . 
To search for those factors , a consensus motif for the GolS-operator ( Fig. 1A ) was generated by the MEME tool ( Bailey and Gribskov , 1998 ) , using GolS-operator sequences from golTS and golB and the putative GolS binding sites in the promoter regions of ATPase encoding genes located next to the 10 most similar GolS orthologue genes in the database ( see Experimental procedures ) . 
We then screened the Salmonella LT2 genome for matching motifs using the MAST program ( Bailey and Gribskov , 1998 ) . 
From the 684 matches detected by the program , we arbitrary selected those that ( i ) matched with position P-value below 1.0 e-7 , ( ii ) were located within an intergenic region , and ( iii ) were upstream and in the correct orientation of the downstream open reading frames . 
By using these criteria , only ﬁve candidates were selected ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Among these , we identiﬁed the GolS-target operators from the golTS operon and the golB gene ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) , as well as the CueR-controlled operators from cueO and copA genes ( Kim et al. , 2002 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
The ﬁfth putative operator sequence was located upstream of STM0352 , the ﬁrst gene of an operon encoding for a Salmonella-speciﬁc CBA efflux system ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
Interestingly , this operon is separated 276 bp of golTS , forming a divergon ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Because genes under either GolS or CueR control appeared in the in silico analysis , we tested whether STM0352 transcription was controlled by any of these two transcriptional regulators . 
Using a chromosomal lacZ transcriptional fusion to the promoter of STM0352 , we analy-sed its expression in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) without or with the addition of either 10 mM AuHCl4 or 1 mM CuSO4 ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Only background expression of the STM0352 reporter fusion was observed in the wild-type strain grown in LB , coincident with previous published results ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Addition of Au , but not Cu , provoked an 80-fold induction of STM0352 transcription . 
This Au-mediated induction was completely dependent on the presence of a functional GolS . 
On the other hand , deletion of cueR had no effect on the transcription of the reporter gene . 
These results indicate that the operon formed by the STM0350 , STM0351 and STM0352 genes ( originally named as mdsABC ) , is a new member of the gol regulon of Salmo-nella , and we propose to rename it as gesABC , for GolS-induced CBA efflux system operon . 
A 
GolS-regulated CBA system required for Au resistance 815 resistance . 
As predicted , we show that transcription of the gesABC operon is driven by a typical MerR-like promoter , in which we identify a GolS-recognized operator . 
Transcription of gesABC is delayed compared with the Au-induced expression of golTS or golB , and requires higher GolS intracellular levels , suggesting a hierarchical activation of the gol regulon to cope with contaminated environments . 
In addition , induction by Au of gesABC in a DacrAB strain increases the resistance to different chemical compounds . 
To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst reported CBA efflux system conferring cross-resistance to metals and other xenobiotics regulated by a metal-responsive MerR-like regulator . 
Analysis of the GolS operator in gesABC
To examine the interaction of GolS with its operator in the gesABC promoter region , we ﬁrst identiﬁed the transcription start site of the operon by primer extension analysis . 
A major primer extension product was detected , corresponding to an A residue located 55 nucleotides upstream of the gesA start codon , with RNA isolated from the wildtype strain grown in the presence of 10 mM AuHCl4 but not with RNA from the DgolS strain ( Fig. 3A ) .

The data correspond to mean values of four independent experiments performed in duplicate . 
Error bars correspond to the standard deviations . 
To experimentally deﬁne the DNA sequence that GolS recognizes in the gesABC promoter region , DNase I footprinting analysis was performed on both the coding and non-coding strands of the gesABC promoter fragment using puriﬁed GolS ( Fig. 3B and C ) . 
The transcriptional regulator protected from nt -8 to nt -38 relative to the transcription start site of the promoter in the coding strand , whereas bases -19 and -31 showed hypersensitivity to cleavage . 
On the non-coding strand , GolS protected from nt -16 to nt -47 , and bases -22 and -34 showed hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage . 
Thus , there was an overlap of 23 bp between the two strands which were protected by the regulator protein , which essentially matched with the in silico predicted GolS operator ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The size of the footprint , its location within the -35 and -10 spacer , as well as the internal DNase I hypersensitive sites , are hallmarks which distinguish the MerR family of transcriptional regulators ( O'Halloran et al. , 1989 ; Ansari et al. , 1995 ; Outten et al. , 1999 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
Alignment of gesABC , golTS and golB promoter regions ( Fig. 3D ) highlights the presence of an inverted repeat sequence that deﬁnes the GolS operator as 5 ′ - CTT 
GACCTTcCcAcanTgGcAAggTctAG-3 ′ , albeit less conserved in the gesABC promoter than in the other two loci . 
The GesABC system is required for Au resistance A DgesABC mutant strain was tested for susceptibility to Au salts . 
Deletion of the gesABC operon rendered a strain similarly susceptible to Au than a DgolT DgolB double mutant , and intermediate between the wild-type strain and the DgolS mutant ( Fig. 4A ) . 
Wild-type resistance phenotype was restored after complementation of the DgesABC mutant strain with the expression plasmid pGESAB , which harbours the RND and the MFS coding genes of the gesABC operon ( Fig. 4A ) . 
To test whether the high susceptibility to Au ions of the DgolS mutant ( Fig. 3A and Checa et al. , 2007 ) is due to the lack of expression of gesABC , besides golT and golB , we generated an otherwise wild-type strain with non-polar deletions of all GolS-controlled effector genes , i.e. DgesABC DgolT DgolB ( as described in Experimental procedures ) . 
Au-induced expression of GolS in this strain remains under control of the golTS promoter ( data not shown ) . 
We observed that the DgesABC DgolT DgolB strain was as susceptible to Au salts as the DgolS strain ( Fig. 4A ) . 
From these results , we conclude that the residual Au-resistance level displayed by the DgolT DgolB strain is due to the GolS-induced expression of the GesABC efflux system .

The gesABC operon is neither activated by copper nor required for copper resistance
We have previously reported that copper has a moderate effect on GolS-mediated golB and golTS induction in a Salmonella wild-type strain , although none of these genes have a primary role on copper tolerance ( Checa et al. , 2007 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
On the other hand , in a strain deleted of the main Cu-transporter gene copA , an increased Cu-mediated activation of GolS enhances golB and golTS transcription . 
In this mutant strain , we also showed that GolT , and to a lesser extent GolB , contribute to eliminate the excess of copper ions ( Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
We measured the effect of copper on gesABC transcription either in the wild-type or in a DcopA strain ( Fig. 4B ) . 
No increase in gesABC expression was detected even in the DcopA strain grown in the presence of 1 mM CuSO4 . 
In the same condition , transcription of golB increased almost 65-fold . 
We also observed that the DgesABC mutant strain retained wild-type levels of Cu tolerance , even in the presence of single or multiple mutations in cuiD , copA or golT , either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions ( Table 1 ) . 
These results argue against a role of GesABC in Cu resistance . 
The differential regulation observed among GolS-controlled genes , together with the observation of a less conserved GolS operator in the gesABC promoter , suggest that there is a hierarchy in the GolS-controlled transcription of its target genes . 
Hierarchical induction of the GolS-controlled genes To gain insight into the proposed hierarchical induction among GolS-controlled genes , we ﬁrst compared in vitro the interaction of GolS with DNA fragments containing each of its target operators ( Fig. 5A ) . 
By gel shift analysis , retardation of the fragment containing the gesABC operator was detected when incubated with 0.1 mM of puri-ﬁed GolS , with an apparent K of 1.4 0.4 ¥ 10-6 D M. On the other hand , concentrations as low as 0.005 mM of puriﬁed GolS were required for band retardation of both golB and golTS promoter fragments , with apparent KD of -8 -8 5.8 1.2 ¥ 10 and 9.9 2.1 ¥ 10 M respectively .

GesABC can direct the efflux of different compounds after GolS-induced expression
A recent report indicates that overexpression of GesABC ( previously named MdsABC ) from a heterologous promoter mediates resistance to different antimicrobial agents and chemical compounds in a DacrB mutant strain ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Nevertheless , it has been reported that the operon is not expressed under laboratory conditions and , in consequence , its deletion does not affect drug resistance . 
We evaluated whether this efflux system mediates cross-resistance to toxic compounds when expressed from its indigenous GolS-controlled promoter . 
Wild-type levels of resistance to both crystal violet ( CV ) and methylene blue ( MB ) were observed for the DgesABC mutant strain , when pre-incubated both in the presence and in the absence of Au salts ( Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , overnight pre-incubation of the DacrAB mutant strain with Au ions resulted in an increased resistance to both CV and MB , reaching similar levels to those reported by GesABC overexpression ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Moreover , the observed Au-induced resistance phenotype to these compounds was completely lost if either gesABC or golS was deleted , indicating that it depends on the Au - and GolS-mediated expression of GesABC . 
As expected , no GesABC-dependent increase of resistance was detected after overnight pre-incubation with either CV , MB or even a. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB supplemented either with 10 mM AuHCl4 ( Au ) , 0.5 mg ml-1 CV ( CV ) , 8 mg ml-1 MB , or without addition ( -- ) , prior to the susceptibility assay . 
b. MIC values were determined in LB plates containing increasing amounts of CV or MB . 
The data correspond to mean values of ﬁve independent experiments done in triplicate . 
GolS-regulated CBA system required for Au resistance 819 We then compared the kinetics of the Au-induced transcription of both gesABC and golB in wild-type cells grown in the presence of 10 mM of AuHCl4 ( Fig. 5B ) . 
To ensure that the response does not depend on the promoter strength , the activities were normalized against the maximal response obtained in each case . 
We estimated the time required for half-maximal induction of gesABC and golB reporter fusions as 5.8 and 3.6 h respectively . 
Because GolS autoinduces its own expression in response to Au , these results strongly suggest that higher intracellular concentrations of the regulator are needed to stimulate gesABC transcription than for the induction of golTS or golB . 
To conﬁrm this , we determined gesABC and golB relative transcription in a DgolS strain expressing GolS from pPB1205 , a pUHE21-2lacI q-based plasmid . 
Thus , expression of the transcriptional regulator from this plasmid was controlled by the PlacO3/O4 promoter and , in consequence , by the concentration of IPTG added to the Au-containing growth medium ( Fig. 5C ) . 
In these conditions , we estimated that the half-maximal induction of gesBAC was reached at 8.7 mM IPTG , while the halfmaximal induction of golB was attained at 0.8 mM IPTG . 
These observations not only corroborate the occurrence of a hierarchical induction among GolS-controlled genes , but also suggest that in resting conditions , GolS is not interacting with the gesABC promoter region . 
Fig. 5 . 
Hierarchical induction of the GolS-controlled genes . 
A. Comparative EMSA was performed using 6 fmol of 32P 3 ′ - end-labelled PCR fragment from gesABC , golB or golTS promoter regions and puriﬁed GolS at ﬁnal concentrations of 0 , 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.8 and 1.5 mM respectively . 
B. Time-course of GolS-controlled induction of gesABC and golB transcription in the presence of Au . 
Overnight cells grown in LB were incubated in the same media containing 10 mM AuHCl4 . 
At the times indicated , aliquots were withdrawn from the culture to determine OD630 and b-galactosidase activity . 
The activity was normalized against the maximal response obtained for each transcriptional fusion ( 278 and 10 090 Miller units were the maximal values obtained for gesABC : : lacZ and golB : : lacZ in these conditions respectively ) . 
C. Relative gesABC and golB transcription in a DgolS strain harbouring plasmid pGOLS . 
Cells were grown overnight in LB media containing 10 mM AuHCl4 and the indicated ﬁnal concentrations of IPTG . 
b-Galactosidase activity was normalized against the maximal response obtained in each case ( 363 Miller units for gesABC : : lacZ at 50 mM IPTG , and 7830 Miller units for golB : : lacZ at 25 mM IPTG ) . 
Data correspond to mean values of at least four independent experiments performed in duplicate . 
Error bars correspond to standard deviation . 
Cu ions . 
( We noticed a gesABC - and acrAB-independent increase in MB resistance after overnight pre-incubation with either CV or MB . ) 
Finally , and as it was observed for copper , neither CV nor MB could induce the expression of either gesABC or golB ( Table 3 ) . 
In sum , our results demonstrate that gesABC encodes for a functional efflux system able to mediate resistance to other chemical compounds after its Au-induced and GolSmediated expression . 
Discussion
Bacteria are able to resist to a wide range of poisonous compounds , including dangerous heavy metals ( Nies , 2003 ) . 
S. enterica , as a pathogen , spends a good part of its life within the infected host , but it is also able to survive as stable , dividing populations in the environment . 
This bacterium harbours several genes which are absent from related enteric species and are not required for virulence . 
Then , it has been suggested that they may be required for survival in certain niches , outside the host ( Winﬁeld and Groisman , 2003 ) . 
In previous reports ( Checa et al. , 2007 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) , we have characterized a Salmonella-speciﬁc locus involved in Au resistance , which encodes a MerR-like Au sensor , GolS , and its regulated factors , the P-type ATPase GolT , and metal binding protein GolB . 
In this work , we identiﬁed and characterized a new member of the gol regulon , the Salmonella-speciﬁc gesABC operon , coding for a CBA efflux system required for Au resistance . 
Although MerR-like proteins have been shown to regulate the transcription of genes encoding ATPase and MFS transporters ( Grkovic et al. , 2002 ; Brown et al. , 2003 ) , to our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report of a CBA efflux system shown to be controlled by a MerR regulator . 
Some unique features emerged in the characterization of the GolS control of gesABC transcription . 
While it was activated in the presence of micromolar concentrations of AuHCl4 in a similar manner than the other GolS-regulated genes , it was not induced in the presence of copper ( Figs 2C and 4B ) or silver ( our unpublished observation ) ions . 
Unexpectedly , no Cu induction of GesABC was observed even in the DcopA mutant strain , which was shown to trigger a substantial GolS-dependent induction of golTS and golB ( Fig. 4B and Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
By in silico analysis , we noticed that the GolS operator in the gesABC promoter is less conserved than those present in the other two GolS-regulated loci ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The predicted differences in binding affinities between GolS and its target operators were conﬁrmed in vitro as well as in vivo ( Fig. 5 ) . 
These studies establish that in the presence of Au ions , higher intracellular concentrations of GolS are required to induce a similar level of expression of GesABC than the other two regulated factors , which reﬂects a hierarchical pattern of induction among

a. b-Galactosidase activity was measured in cells after overnight growth in LB broth without ( -- ) or with the addition of the indicated amounts of AuHCl4 ( Au ) , CV or MB . 
The data correspond to mean values of four independent experiments performed in duplicate . 
Standard deviations are indicated in each case . 
GolS-regulated loci . 
Although the gesABC operator / promoter region has a predicted suboptimal spacing of 19 bp between the -35 and -10 elements , which is probably responsible of the low-level expression of this operon in the absence of the inducer , our ﬁndings strongly suggest that in resting conditions , GolS is not interacting with the gesABC promoter . 
It has been observed that bacteria usually employ different strategies to reduce the intracellular concentration of poisonous compounds , that generally involve low - and high-affinity transporters ( Chamnongpol and Groisman , 2002 ; Finney and O'Halloran , 2003 ; Yamamoto and Ishihama , 2005 ) . 
We demonstrate here that this control can also be exerted at a transcriptional level by the hierarchical induction of expression of different transporters . 
The above data allow us to propose a model which accounts for a sequential control of transcription of GolS-target genes in Au-contaminated environments . 
According to our results , in the absence of stimulus , background expression of the sensor protein is ensured by basal transcription of golTS ( Fig. 6A ) . 
In the presence of Au ions expression of golTS and golB , which will compensate for the deﬁciency , directing active copper efflux . 
Still , in these conditions the intracellular concentration of GolS attained would be insufficient for interacting with its operator in gesABC to promote transcription of the efflux transporter operon . 
Therefore , even in the absence of a functional cue regulon the efflux pump GesABC does not contribute to eliminate Cu excess . 
It is worth mentioning that Au-induced GesABC expression does not confer copper resistance to a wild-type strain , to DgolT DcopA or to DgolT DcopA DcuiD strains ( our unpublished observation ) , establishing that this system is not functional for mediating Cu efflux . 
The demonstrated role of GesABC in Au resistance ( Fig. 4A ) strongly suggests a direct role of the CBA system in Au efflux . 
GesB , the RND component of the tripartite efflux pump , displays a substrate motif which differs from the consensus sequence AVGX3DAAX3IEN present in monovalent heavy metal ion transporters such as the Cu transporter CusA and the silver transporter SilA ( Gupta et al. , 1999 ; Franke et al. , 2003 ) , and shows higher similarities to RND proteins which export organic substances , such as AcrB and MexF ( Nies , 2003 ; Hernandez-Mendoza et al. , 2007 ) . 
In this sense , we and others have shown that GesABC can also detoxify different antimicrobial agents and chemical compounds either in DacrAB or in DacrB mutant strains ( Table 2 and Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , neither of these compounds could induce the expression of the efflux system ( Table 3 ) , and the resistance phenotype could only be detected after Au - and GolS-mediated induction ( Table 2 ) or by ectopic gesABC overexpression ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Metal contamination represents an ancient , widespread and persistent selection pressure for the onset , maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance with both environmental and clinical importance ( Baker-Austin et al. , 2006 , and references therein ) . 
It has been shown that several efflux systems can confer cross-resistance to metals and chemical compounds such as antibiotics . 
i.e. P. aeruginosa MexGHI-OpmD confers resistance to vanadium , antibiotics and it is able to transport a quinolone derivative involved in cell-to-cell communication ( Aende-kerk et al. , 2002 ; Aendekerk et al. , 2005 ) . 
The Listeria monocytogenes multidrug efflux transporter MdrL is required for resistance to ethidium bromide , macrolides , cefotaxime and heavy metals ( Mata et al. , 2000 ) . 
Microarray analysis of chemostat-cultured E. coli cells demonstrated that the RpoS-controlled mdtABC operon is upregulated in response to zinc excess ( Lee et al. , 2005 ) . 
In view of the Au and chemical compounds ' crossresistance displayed by GesABC ( Table 3 ) , it is also possible that this efflux system would function to eliminate cellular metabolites damaged by or forming complexes with Au , rather than the direct transport of the toxic metal ion . 
The elucidation of the substrate selectivity of this CBA efflux will be fundamental to reveal its unique role in Salmonella . 
GolS-regulated CBA system required for Au resistance 821 ( Fig. 6B ) , Au-GolS actively induces the expression of GolT and GolB , both required for the removal of free Au ions from the cytoplasm , as well as its own expression . 
In addition , the raise in GolS concentration could also help to lower intracellular free Au levels by direct sequestration . 
Nevertheless , at this point , the intracellular concentration of the sensor protein has not reached the threshold required for gesABC activation . 
If the exposure to the toxic metal persists , GolS will accumulate , inducing gesABC transcription ( Fig. 6C ) . 
The CBA efflux system can then contribute to eliminate the excess of toxic metal either from the cytoplasm or from the periplasm , alleviating the metal stress ( Fig. 6C ) . 
To cope with Cu excess , Salmonella employs the products of the ancestral cue regulon ( Kim et al. , 2002 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
In these conditions , low-level induction of the loci harbouring high-affinity GolS operators in their promoters , i.e. golTS and golB , is attained by Cu-activated GolS ( Fig. 6D ) . 
In the absence of a functional CopA , the intracellular Cu concentration would increase . 
Cu-activated GolS will in turn increase the 
Fig. 6 . 
Proposed model for GolS-controlled transcription of the gol regulon in the presence of monovalent metal ions . 
A . 
In the absence of stimulus , GolS does not stimulate the transcription of its target genes . 
B . 
In the presence of micromolar concentrations of Au ions , Au-GolS will induce the transcription of golTS and golB ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
According to the current model of MerR regulation , the metal-activated regulator allosterically stimulates transcription initiation by remodelling by s70 RNA polymerase-dependent promoter structure ( Giedroc and Arunkumar , 2007 ) . 
Metal recognition by the sensor protein does not affect its DNA affinity . 
C . 
At latter times after contact with the toxic metal , or when the exposure to the toxic metal persists , the intracellular accumulation of GolS will reach the threshold required to recognize the gesABC operator and induce its transcription . 
Expression of GolS could also help to lower intracellular free Au levels by direct sequestration . 
D. Salmonella employs the ancestral cue regulon to cope with cytoplasmic Cu excess ( Kim et al. , 2002 ; Espariz et al. , 2007 ) . 
Then , free intracellular Cu will remain negligible . 
In this condition , the gol regulon is not induced . 
E . 
In the absence of a functional CopA , GolS will detect the increase in the intracellular Cu concentration , inducing the expression of golTS and golB ( Espariz et al. , 2007 ) , which harbour high-affinity GolS operators . 
Expression of these proteins will compensate the CopA deﬁciency , directing active copper efflux . 
Still , in these conditions the intracellular concentration of GolS would be under the threshold necessary for interacting with its operator in gesABC .

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 4 . 
Bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth or LB agar plates . 
Ampicillin was used at 100 mg ml-1 , kanamycin at 25 mg ml-1 , and chloramphenicol at 10 mg ml-1 . 
IPTG was added , when necessary , to induced GolS expression . 
All reagents , chemicals and oligonucleotides were from Sigma . 
Bacterial genetics and molecular biology techniques
Strains carrying gene disruptions or lacZ reporter fusion to promoters on the chromosome were constructed using Lambda Red-mediated recombination ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2002 ) and moved into the wild-type 14028s background by P22 transduction as previously described ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
The sequences of the primers employed are available upon request . 
When necessary , the antibiotic resistance cassette inserted at the deletion point was removed using the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( Cherepanov and Wackernagel , 1995 ) . 
To construct plasmid pPB1211 ( Table 4 ) , a region of 4409 bp containing the gesA and gesB genes was ampliﬁed from Salmonella chromosome by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , using primers gesAB-F ( 5 ′ - CGCGGATCCATGCGTA GAACATTC-3 ′ ) and gesAB-R ( 5 ′ - CCCAAGCTTATGCTTGC TGATCATG-3 ′ ) . 
The fragment obtained was cloned into the q BamHI -- HindIII-digested pUH21-2laqI vector to generate the gesAB expression plasmid . 
Plasmid DNA was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
Metal induction and inhibition assays
b-Galactosidase assays and minimum concentration inhibitory ( MIC ) determination were carried out basically as described previously ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
In total , 30 ml of aliquots from a 5 ¥ 10-7 dilution in PBS of each strain was applied to LB plates containing varying concentrations of AuHCl4 , CuSO4 , MB or CV . 
After 24 -- 48 h of incubation at 37 °C , the MIC values were determined as the minimal concentration of compound in which no growth was observed . 
When necessary , colony-forming units per ml were calculated and the percentage of survival estimated , based on the count of the corresponding strain grown in the absence of added compound . 
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay , using bovine serum albumin as standard . 
Primer extension
Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or DgolS strains grown in SM9 medium without or with the addition of 
10 mM AuHCl4 as previously described ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
A total of 2 pmol 32P-end-labelled primer PROM-ges-R ( 5 ′ - CAAGCGTATTCAGGCTGCACGGTTC-3 ′ ) , 50 mg of total RNA and 1 U of SuperScript II RNase H2 reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) were used for cDNA synthesis . 
The extension product was analysed by electrophoresis on a 6 % polyacrylamide-8 M urea gel and compared with sequence ladders initiated with the same 32P-labelled primer which was used for primer extension . 
Protein–DNA interaction analysis
Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) was performed essentially as previously described ( Lejona et al. , 2003 ; Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
The DNA fragments corresponding to the gesABC , golTS and golB promoter regions were ampliﬁed by PCR using the primers PROM-ges-F ( 5 ′ - CTCCCGGGAATTTTGAATGTTCTAC-3 ′ ) and PROM-ges-R ( see above ) ; PROM-golT/S-F ( 5 ′ - GGCGTGGGTCGGCAT CGTGGC-3 ′ ) and PROM-golT/S-R ( 5 ′ - TCCCCCGGGAGCT TATCGTGTCGTG-3 ′ ) ; and PROM-golB-F ( 5 ′ - AGGAATTC ACGTATCCAGAACATGC-3 ′ ) and PROM-golB-R ( 5 ′ - TCC CCCGGGCAGCCGCCGCAGGTC-3 ′ ) respectively . 
Approximately 6 fmol of each labelled DNA fragment was incubated with puriﬁed GolS ( in the amounts indicated in the legend to Fig. 5A ) at room temperature for 20 min . 
Samples were run on an 8 % non-denaturing Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel at room temperature . 
After electrophoresis , the gel was dried and autoradiographed . 
Three individual experiments were densitometrically scanned to determine the apparent KD , which is the concentration of GolS that shifts 50 % of the DNA . 
DNase I footprinting assays were performed for both DNA strands essentially as described ( Espariz et al. , 2007 ) , using 
120 pmol of puriﬁed GolS , 6 fmol of labelled DNA corresponding to the ges promoter region ( obtained as described for EMSA ) and 0.05 U of DNase I ( Promega ) . 
In total , 5 ml of samples was analysed by denaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with either PROM-ges-F or PROM-ges-R primers . 
GolS was puriﬁed from E. coli XL1-Blue strain carrying plasmid pGOLS as essentially described ( Checa et al. , 2007 ) . 
Bioinformatics
A consensus motif of GolS-operator sequences was generated using the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation tool , MEME ( Bailey and Gribskov , 1998 ) . 
To train the program , we ﬁrst selected the 10 most homologous proteins to the ﬁrst 60 amino acid residues of the N-terminal sequence of GolS ( DNA binding domain ) by BLASTP analysis . 
This included GolS-like proteins from Shewanella sp .

The genes encoding these GolS orthologues are contiguous to , and forming predicted operons with , a P-type ATPase coding genes . 
We identiﬁed a GolS-like operator sequence upstream each of these predicted transcriptional units that also show the conserved 5 ′ - TTGACC-3 ′ -35 element ( Fig. 1A ) .

GolS operator of each of the above operons , and the corresponding sequence from golTS and golB promoters , were used as the training set for the MEME program , to identify one motif per sequence . 
The position-speciﬁc scoring matrix obtained was then used to search for matching motifs by MAST in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 genome sequence as the database ( Bailey and Gribskov , 1998 ) . 
Matches with P-values below 1.0 e-7 , in intergenic regions , and in the correct orientation ( taking into account the presence of the -35 element ) to the downstream genes were considered for further analysis .
