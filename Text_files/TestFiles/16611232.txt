Summary 
Essential to salmonellae pathogenesis is an export device called the type III secretion system ( TTSS ) , which mediates the transfer of bacterial effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the host cell cytoplasm . 
Once inside the host cell , these effectors are then capable of altering a variety of host cellular functions in order to promote bacterial survival and colonization . 
SspH1 is a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TTSS effector that localizes to the mammalian nucleus and down-modulates production of proinﬂammatory cytokines by inhibiting nuclear factor ( NF ) - κB-dependent gene expression . 
To identify mammalian binding partners of SspH1 a yeast two-hybrid screen against a human spleen cDNA library was performed . 
It yielded a serine/threonine protein kinase called protein kinase N 1 ( PKN1 ) . 
The leucine-rich repeat domain of SspH1 was demonstrated to mediate this interaction and also inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression . 
This suggested that PKN1 may play a role in modulation of the NF-κB signalling pathway . 
Indeed , we found that expression of constitutively active PKN1 in mammalian cells results in a decrease , while depletion of PKN1 by RNA interference causes an increase in NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression . 
These data indicate that SspH1 may inhibit the host 's inﬂammatory response by interacting with PKN1 . 
Introduction
Salmonellae are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that can cause a variety of serious diseases in humans and animals , ranging from self-limiting gastroenteritis to the potentially life-threatening systemic illness typhoid fever ( Pegues et al. , 2005 ) . 
One strategy of salmonellae to survive within animal hosts is their ability to subvert an array

of host cellular functions by delivering bacterial proteins , called effectors , directly into the host cells ' cytoplasm ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
After translocation these effectors localize to speciﬁc compartments within host cells and target speciﬁc host signalling pathways , often via their enzymatic activities . 
Salmonellae encode two separate effector transport systems , termed type III secretion systems ( TTSS ) , within Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPI ) 1 and 2 that function at different times during the infection . 
The SPI1 TTSS translocates effectors across the plasma membrane and mediates invasion of the host cell , while the SPI2 TTSS secrets proteins across the vacuolar membrane and promotes intracellular survival and replication . 
The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium effector protein SspH1 can be delivered into mammalian cells by both the SPI1 and the SPI2 TTSS ; however , it appears to be constitutively expressed ( Miao et al. , 1999 ) . 
Once inside the host cell , it localizes to the nucleus , inhibits nuclear factor ( NF ) - κB-dependent gene expression , and contributes to down-modulation of proinﬂammatory cytokine production by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) . 
SspH1 belongs to a family of bacterial proteins that contains leucine-rich repeats ( LRR ) of the LPX type ( Miao et al. , 1999 ) . 
This family includes at least 15 effectors from six bacterial genera , including the Salmonella SspH2 and SlrP , the Yersinia YopM and the Shigella IpaH9 .8 . 
The LRR is a motif that typically mediates protein -- protein interactions in eukaryotes ( Buchanan and Gay , 1996 ) . 
Since no enzymatic activities have been found for these LPX repeat proteins , it is plausible that this effector family simply functions to bind mammalian proteins as its pathogenic mechanism . 
This manuscript demonstrates that SspH1 interacts with the human serine/threonine kinase protein kinase N 1 ( PKN1 ) . 
Since PKN1 activation can also down-modulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression , we hypothesize that SspH1 inhibits the NF-κB signalling pathway by interacting with PKN1 . 
Results
SspH1 interacts with the mammalian serine/threonine kinase PKN1
Since SspH1 contains LRR , which is thought to be a protein -- protein recognition motif in eukaryotes , we hypothesized that SspH1 interacts with a host protein after translocation by the TTSS . 
To identify mammalian interacting partners SspH1 was assayed by the yeast two-hybrid system . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SspH1 was fused to the DNA binding domain ( BD ) of the yeast Gal4 transcriptional activator and was coexpressed in yeast with a human spleen cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activator domain ( AD ) . 
Approximately 4 × 106 transformants were screened by growth on synthetic medium lacking histidine , and the resulting colonies were further tested for expression of two additional reporter genes , ADE2 and LacZ . 
Eighty-four colonies containing nine different cDNA were selected , none of which encoded a protein that bound to the controls SspH2 and SlrP , when they were expressed in yeast as Gal4 BD -- effector protein fusions . 
One of the identiﬁed cDNA encoded PKN1 ( also called protein kinase C-like 1 or PRKCL1 , and protein kinase C-related kinase 1 or PRK1 ) , a fatty acid - and Rho-activated serine/threonine protein kinase that has a cata-lytic domain highly homologous to that of protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( for review see Mukai , 2003 ) . 
We decided to conﬁrm this interaction by co-immuno-precipitation , because another member of the PKN family , PKN2/PRK2 , has been shown to interact with YopM ( McDonald et al. , 2003 ) , a Yersinia effector containing the same type of LRR as SspH1 . 
CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing haemaggluti-nin ( HA ) - tagged SspH1 or another bacterial LPX repeat protein , such as SspH2 , YopM , IpaH9 .8 and SlrP , as controls , and FLAG-tagged PKN1 . 
The proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG - ( data not shown ) or anti-HA-agarose antibody conjugate . 
As shown in Fig. 1A and B , PKN1-FLAG co-immunoprecipitated with SspH1-HA but not with SspH2-HA , HA-YopM , HA-IpaH9 .8 and SlrP-HA . 
Similarly , endogenous PKN1 co-immunoprecip-itated with HA-tagged SspH1 but not SseJ , another SPI2 TTSS effector , when these proteins were delivered into HeLa cells by bacterial translocation , instead of transfection ( Fig. 1C ) . 
The speciﬁcity of the SspH1-PKN1 binding was further demonstrated by showing that the highly similar PRK2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with SspH1 . 
[ Note that SspH1 migrates on polyacrylamide gels as a doublet , when expressed in mammalian cells by transfection , while it is a single band , when it is delivered into cells by the bacterial TTSS ( Fig. 1A and C ) . 
We hypothesize that the amino-terminus of this protein is unstable in the absence of a bacterial chaperone , resulting in the appearance of an additional smaller , faster migrating band . ] 
Therefore , these data demonstrate that SspH1 speciﬁcally binds PKN1 , most likely through a direct protein -- protein interaction .

SspH1 interacts with the amino-terminal regulatory domain of PKN1 within three antiparallel coiled-coil folds
PKN1 can be divided into two main domains , an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxy-terminal serine / threonine kinase domain , which is constitutively active in the absence of the regulatory domain ( Takahashi et al. , 1998 ) . 
To determine which of these two PKN1 regions SspH1 interacts with , SspH1-HA was coexpressed in 
Fig. 1 .

CHO-K1 cells with epitope-tagged versions of these PKN1 fragments and was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA-agarose antibody conjugate . 
We found that SspH1 interacted with the amino - but not the carboxy-terminal portion of PKN1 . 
As shown in Fig. 2A and B , Myc-PKN1 ( 1-560 ) co-immunoprecipitated with SspH1-HA , while PKN1 ( 561-942 ) - FLAG did not . 
The control SspH2 did not precipitate either of these fragments . 
To further deﬁne the region of interaction , the PKN1 amino acid sequence was submitted to Robetta ( http://robetta.bakerlab.org ) , a fully automated full-chain protein structure prediction server , and the sequence was parsed into domains by Ginzu and subsequently modelled by homology or ab initio depending on the extent of existing information ( Kim et al. , 2004 ) . 
Based on this analysis the amino-terminus of PKN1 consists of ﬁve domains : three homologous antiparallel coiled-coil ( ACC ) fold domains ( amino acids 1 -- 343 ) , which function as a binding interface to various proteins including the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 ( Maesaki et al. , 1999 ) , a putative Ras BD ( amino acids 344 -- 437 ) predicted by its similarity to that of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 ( Terada et al. , 1999 ) , and a Src homology ( SH ) 2/3 domain ( amino acids 438 -- 560 ) , which provides the structural basis for the autoinhibition of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase ( Nagar et al. , 2003 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 2C , HA-tagged SspH1 , but not the control SspH2 , immunoprecipitated Myc-PKN1 ( 1-437 ) and Myc-PKN1 ( 1-343 ) , while it did not immunoprecipitate PKN1 ( 438-942 ) - FLAG and PKN1 ( 344-942 ) - FLAG . 
These results , which are summarized in Fig. 2D , indicate that SspH1 binds to PKN1 within its three ACC fold domains . 
The LRR domain of SspH1 mediates interaction with PKN1 and inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression 
Since SspH2 and SlrP do not interact with PKN1 but share high homology to SspH1 , chimeric proteins of SspH1 and SspH2 or SspH1 and SlrP were constructed based on their similar structure to identify the SspH1 domain mediating the interaction with PKN1 . 
DNA sequences encoding the amino-terminal , the LRR , and the carboxy-terminal domains of SspH1 and SspH2 or SlrP were swapped by Strand Overlap Exchange ( SOE ) PCR and were labelled with an HA tag . 
The resulting constructs were then coexpressed with FLAG-tagged PKN1 in CHO-K1 cells by transient transfection and those that encoded stable proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the HA tag . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , PKN1-FLAG co-immunoprecipi-tated only with those chimeras that contained the LRR domain of SspH1 , amino acid residues 206 -- 372 . 
This suggests that the LRR domain of SspH1 mediates the interaction with PKN1 . 
Since neither SspH2 nor SlrP has an effect on NF-κB-dependent gene expression ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) , these chimeras were also used to determine whether the LRR domain of SspH1 is the same domain involved in inhibition of NF-κB . 
Therefore , they were expressed in CHO-K1 cells with a reporter construct to measure NF-κB-dependent gene expression , a plasmid to normalize for transfection efﬁciency , and a vector expressing mouse CD14 , which is part of the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) receptor complex . 
Cells were then stimulated with LPS or treated with fresh medium , lysed and assayed for reporter gene activity . 
As shown in Fig. 4 , only those cells that expressed chimeras containing the LRR domain of SspH1 had reduced levels of NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression and activity . 
This suggests that the LRR domain of SspH1 , which mediates interaction with PKN1 , is also involved in inhibition of NF-κB . 
The variation in the level of inhibition by the different chimeras is most likely due to their dissimilar stabilities when expressed in mammalian cells , as shown in Fig. 3 . 
In conclusion , interaction with PKN1 and inhibition of NF-κB activity are both mediated by the LRR domain of SspH1 .

PKN1 activation inhibits NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression
Since the same domain that interacts with PKN1 also inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene expression , we hypothesized that PKN1 plays a role in modulation of the NF-κB pathway . 
To test this hypothesis , CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing only the kinase domain of PKN1 , residues 561 -- 942 , which is constitutively active without its regulatory domain ( Takahashi et al. , 1998 ) , or the same fragment with a mutation in the putative ATP binding site , K644E , which results in a kinase-dead PKN1 ( Gao et al. , 2000 ) , along with the constructs described above to measure NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression . 
Cells were then stimulated with LPS or treated with fresh medium and assayed for reporter gene activity . 
As shown in Fig. 5 , cells expressing the constitutively active form of PKN1 had reduced reporter gene expression and activity compared to cells expressing the kinase-dead PKN1 or the control cells not containing any PKN1-expressing construct , which suggests that activated PKN1 can inhibit NF-κB . 
To measure the effect of endogenous PKN1 on NF-κB , cells were depleted of PKN1 using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . 
HeLa cells were transfected with PKN1-speciﬁc or non-targeting small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) and the NF-κB reporter construct , were stimulated with tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α , and reporter gene activity was measured . 
Depletion of PKN1 was conﬁrmed by immuno-blotting the cell lysates with an anti-PKN1 antibody . 
As shown in Fig. 6 , these results agreed with our previous ﬁnding using the exogenously expressed constitutively active PKN1 . 
Cells that had reduced levels of PKN1 had increased NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression and activity , which suggests that PKN1 can inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression and may play a role in the NF-κB signalling pathway .

PKN1 is phosphorylated during Salmonella infection To determine whether PKN1 activity is modulated during Salmonella infection , the phosphorylation level of PKN1 
Salmonella effector interacts with PKN1 841 was examined during infection . 
Since phosphorylation at threonine ( Thr ) -774 within the activation loop of PKN1 has been shown to be required for its catalytic activity in vivo ( Flynn et al. , 2000 ) , measuring phosphorylation at this residue is thus an indication of PKN1 activity . 
Intestine-407 cells were infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 50 for 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4.5 h , the infected cells were lysed , and the lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies speciﬁc for unphosphorylated PKN1 and PKN1 phosphorylated at Thr-774 . 
As shown in Fig. 7A , PKN1 becomes phosphorylated approximately 3 h after infection . 
( Although the phospho-speciﬁc antibody also detects PRK2 phosphorylated at its activation loop , based on their size the bands in Fig. 7 represent phosphorylated PKN1 , not PRK2 . ) 
This occurs approximately 2 h after the invasion-associated signalling cascade , as demonstrated by the phosphorylation level of p38 ( Fig. 7A ) , suggesting that these two events are independent ( Hobbie et al. , 1997 ) . 
The timing of the PKN1 phosphorylation also indicates that perhaps an effector translocated by the SPI2 TTSS activates PKN1 . 
To determine whether this effector is SspH1 , Intes-tine-407 cells were infected with wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium or the same strain deleted for sspH1 and the phosphorylation levels of PKN1 at Thr-774 were compared in these cells . 
As shown in Fig. 7B , PKN1 is phosphorylated in cells infected with the ∆ sspH1 Salmo-nella similarly to those infected with the wild-type strain . 
This implies either that SspH1 is not required for phosphorylation of PKN1 during infection or that other effectors or mechanisms are also capable of activating PKN1 .

Discussion
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium induces a complex array of mammalian signalling pathways essential for its survival in host tissues . 
It stimulates rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton leading to membrane rufﬂing and internalization of the bacterium , and nuclear responses resulting in the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and diarrhoea ( Galan , 2001 ) . 
The bacterium also has the ability to interfere with the maturation of the Salmonellacontaining vacuole , allowing it to avoid phagocytic killing and to replicate intracellularly , and to down-modulate the host 's inﬂammatory response presumably to persist within its host for prolonged periods ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) . 
The ability of the bacterium to stimulate such host responses is dependent on the functions of the SPI1 and the SPI2 TTSS . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes at least 27 translocated effectors , many of whose functions and host cellular targets have been determined . 
In this study we describe the identiﬁcation of an intracellular binding partner of SspH1 , an effector of both TTSS that participates in suppression of proinﬂammatory cytokine secretion by inhibiting NF-κB-dependent gene expression ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) . 
We demonstrate by the yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that SspH1 speciﬁcally interacts with the human serine/threonine protein kinase PKN1 . 
PKN1 is a versatile molecule that regulates a diverse set of cellular functions . 
It has been implicated in cytosk-eletal regulation , vesicle transport , apoptosis , control of the cell cycle and cell signalling ( Kawamata et al. , 1998 ; Takahashi et al. , 1998 ; 2003 ; Dong et al. , 2000 ; Isagawa et al. , 2005 ) . 
It has been shown to be activated by interaction with fatty acids , such as arachidonic acid , and several members of the Rho family of small GTPases , such as RhoA and Rac1 , and by cleavage of the amino-terminal regulatory domain by caspase-3 during apoptosis ( Mukai et al. , 1994 ; Amano et al. , 1996 ; Takahashi et al. , 1998 ) . 
It has the ability to localize to several compartments within the cell , including the cytoplasm , the plasma membrane , vesicles and the nucleus , under different cellular conditions ( Mukai et al. , 1996 ; Torbett et al. , 2003 ; Zhu et al. , 2004 ) . 
For example , in response to heat shock , serum starvation and treatment with sodium ars-enite PKN1 has been shown to translocate into the nucleus . 
It is interesting to speculate whether infection with Salmonella may present a similar stress response resulting in the nuclear localization of PKN1 and its consequent interaction with SspH1 . 
In fact , since SspH1 contains no classical nuclear localization signal and is too large for nucleocytoplasmic diffusion , it may be transported into the nucleus via PKN1 . 
We found that SspH1 binds to the amino-terminal regulatory domain of PKN1 within a region containing three ACC fold repeats . 
The ACC fold domain has been described as a well-deﬁned structure containing two long intertwined alpha-helices and a short amino-terminal helix folded back onto them to form a hydrophobic core that contributes to the stability of the structure ( Maesaki et al. , 1999 ) . 
Although ACC domains are also present in other Rho effector proteins , such as PRK2 , SspH1 speciﬁcally interacts with the PKN1 ACC . 
In addition , each ACC fold in PKN1 is unique in that each has different afﬁnities for different Rho members . 
For example , while ACC1 binds to RhoA and Rac1 with similar high afﬁnities , ACC2 interacts selectively with Rac1 , and ACC3 does not bind either of these two GTPases ( Flynn et al. , 1998 ; Owen et al. , 2003 ) . 
ACC1 has also been shown to contain a pseudosubstrate site that inhibits the kinase activity of PKN1 ( Kitagawa et al. , 1996 ) . 
In fact , yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays have demonstrated that the amino-terminal regulatory region of PKN1 can interact with the carboxy-terminal catalytic half of the molecule and this inhibits PKN1 kinase activity . 
These data suggest that an autoinhibitory intramolecular contact may keep PKN1 in a closed inactive conformation and that binding by activated Rho may act to disrupt this interaction , thereby unmasking the active catalytic domain of PKN1 . 
This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Rho binding is required for activation of PKN1 by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 ( PDK1 ) , a known activator of PKN1 ( Flynn et al. , 2000 ) . 
We hypothesize that SspH1 could induce a similar conformational change in PKN1 that is permissive for binding to PDK1 or another activator of PKN1 . 
SspH1 contains three main domains , a LRR domain containing eight LRR that separates an amino - and a carboxy-terminal domain . 
Since the LRR is a short repeating sequence motif that is thought to present a structural framework for the formation of protein -- protein interactions , we were not surprised to ﬁnd that this domain was mediating the interaction with PKN1 ( Buchanan and Gay , 1996 ) . 
However , the SspH1 -- PKN1 interaction is speciﬁc and is not simply the result of the ` stickiness ' of the curved horseshoe structure of the LRR , because four other TTSS effectors containing very similar LRR , SspH2 , SlrP , IpaH9 .8 and YopM , did not bind to PKN1 . 
Interestingly , the Yersinia enterocolitica YopM , an effector composed almost entirely of LRR , was recently reported to also interact with two serine/threonine kinases , PRK2 and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 ( RSK1 ) ( McDonald et al. , 2003 ) . 
It is possible that other effectors containing the LPX type of LRR also interact with different serine/threonine kinases . 
Their functional differences may lie within their speciﬁcities for the interacting host kinase . 
To date no host targets have been identiﬁed for SlrP , IpaH9 .8 and the LRR domain of SspH2 , and it is tempting to speculate that the function of their LRR domains is to bind kinases . 
LPX repeatcontaining proteins may be a unique family of TTSS effectors in that they do not have enzymatic activities . 
They may simply function as protein binding and localizing mol-ecules , altering mammalian function by changing the subcellular localization of kinases . 
With the exception of YopM , these effectors have additional domains besides the LRR that may promote localization and/or bind other molecules , such as kinase substrates . 
Therefore , this family of proteins in bacterial pathogenesis may have evolved to bind kinases to redirect their subcellular localization and/or to bring them in contact with speciﬁc substrates that would not otherwise be accessible . 
The fact that the LRR domain of SspH1 is also involved in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression further supports the idea that interaction with a serine/threonine kinase is important for the function of an effector of the LPX repeat protein family . 
Unfortunately we were not able determine whether suppression of NF-κB activity by SspH1 requires PKN1 , because sufﬁcient depletion of PKN1 by RNAi took 48 h and SspH1 expression signiﬁcantly declined after 24 h , most likely due to cell toxicity . 
Salmonella effector interacts with PKN1 843 In addition , we were not able to use translocated SspH1 for this experiment , because S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium possesses several other effectors that can also inhibit the NF-κB pathway and our attempts to identify all of them have not been successful . 
However , we did ﬁnd that activated PKN1 could also inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression . 
Whether or not SspH1 directly activates PKN1 is not yet clear . 
The observation that the sspH1 mutant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium could also induce phosphorylation of PKN1 does not rule out the possible importance of SspH1 in PKN1 regulation . 
As there are multiple effectors capable of down-modulating proinﬂammatory signalling , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium may translocate several effectors , whose actions , one way or another , trigger activation of PKN1 . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, mammalian cell lines, culture and infection conditions
The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain CS401 , which is a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant derivative of ATCC ( American Type Culture Collection ) 14028 and carries a phoN : : Tn10d insertion , and its mutant derivative with non-polar deletion of sspH1 ( EM124 ) have been described previously ( Miao et al. , 1999 ; Rakeman et al. , 1999 ) . 
AH58 , which is CS401 transformed with the SspH1-HA-HA-expressing plasmid pAH41 ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) , and JAF119 , which is CS401 harbouring the SseJ-HA-HA-expressing plasmid pJAF111 ( Freeman et al. , 2003 ) , have also been published . 
Human Intestine-407 , HeLa and CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's medium ( Intestine-407 and HeLa ) or RPMI 1640 ( CHO-K1 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U ml − 1 penicillin and 100 µg ml − 1 streptomycin , at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 . 
For infection of mammalian cells bacterial strains were grown in Luria -- Bertani broth overnight , and the cultures were diluted 1:50 and were grown for 3 h at 37 °C with aeration . 
Bacteria were added to mammalian cells at the indicated moi in antibiotic-free culture medium for 1 h , after which the infected cells were washed three times with phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) and were incubated with culture medium containing 50 µg ml − 1 gentamicin for the indicated length of time . 
Plasmid constructions
pAH47 and pAH48 were constructed by inserting the Shigella ﬂexneri ipaH9 .8 and the Yersinia pestis yopM , respectively , into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-HA ( BD Biosciences ) . 
3 ′ HA-tagged chimeric S. enterica serovar Typhimurium sspH1 ( 1-1116 ) sspH2 ( 1372-2367 ) , sspH1 ( 1-617 ) sspH2 ( 637-2367 ) , sspH2 ( 1-1371 ) sspH1 ( 1117-2103 ) , sspH2 ( 1-636 ) sspH1 ( 618-2103 ) , slrP ( 1-567 ) sspH1 ( 618-2103 ) and sspH1 ( 1-617 ) slrP ( 568-2298 ) open reading frames were generated by SOE PCR and were inserted into pTIGZ ( Underhill et al. , 1999 ) , resulting in pAH11 , pAH12 , pAH13 , pAH14 , pAH18 and pAH25 respectively . 
pAH51 , pAH53 and pAH55 were made by PCR amplifying the ﬁrst 1680 , 1311 and 1029 base pairs of human PKN1 , respectively , and inserting them into pCMV-Myc ( BD Biosciences ) . 
3 ′ FLAG-tagged 1312 -- 2826 and 1030 -- 2826 base pair fragments of human PKN1 were PCR ampliﬁed and inserted into pRc/CMV ( Invitrogen ) to yield pAH54 and pAH56 respectively . 
Transfections
Mammalian cells were transiently transfected by electroporation . 
Brieﬂy , DNA in 50 µl of PBS was mixed with 5 × 106 − 107 cells in 0.2 ml of culture medium in a 0.4 cm gap electroporation cuvette ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The cells were pulsed in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 260 V and 960 µFD and were washed with 5 ml of culture medium , before seeding them into 60 mm , 100 mm or 24-well tissue culture dishes . 
After allowing the cells to adhere to the dish for 3 h , the culture medium was changed again and left on until assaying . 
Yeast two-hybrid screen
The pGBD-U plasmid pEM118 expressing the Gal4 DNA BD fused to SspH1 ( Miao et al. , 2003 ) was expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69-4 ( James et al. , 1996 ) . 
The resulting yeast strain then was transformed with Human Spleen MATCHMAKER cDNA Library ( BD Biosciences ) , which expresses the yeast Gal4 AD fused to cDNA library inserts . 
Cotransformants were plated onto medium lacking uracil , leucine and histidine and containing 3 mM 3-aminotriazole . 
HIS3 + colo-nies were further tested for growth on adenine-deﬁcient medium and for production of β-galactosidase by the ﬁlter assay ( James et al. , 1996 ) . 
Clones expressing all three reporter genes , HIS3 + ADE2 + LacZ + , were then cured of the bait sspH1 plasmid on plates containing 5-ﬂuoro-orotic acid and the target cDNA plasmids were rescued . 
To verify the interactions fresh PJ69-4 was retransformed with each target plasmid and was mated with yeast expressing the bait , and the resultant diploids were screened for expression of the HIS3 , ADE2 and LacZ genes . 
PJ69-4 harbouring pEM119 , a plasmid expressing a Gal4 BD -- SspH2 fusion protein , and pEM125 , which expresses Gal4 BD -- SlrP , were used as controls ( Miao et al. , 2003 ) . 
Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting
CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 5 µg of pRc/CMV/PKN-FL expressing human PKN1-FLAG ( Takahashi et al. , 1998 ) , pRC / CMV/PKN/AF3-FL expressing PKN1 ( 561 -- 942 ) - FLAG , pAH51 , pAH53 , pAH54 , pAH55 or pAH56 , and 4 µg of pNeo/Tak expressing the tetracycline transactivator ( Underhill et al. , 1999 ) , along with 5 µg of pAH8 , pAH9 , pAH10 , pAH47 or pAH48 , expressing SlrP-HA , SspH1-HA , SspH2-HA , HA-IpaH9 .8 and HA-YopM respectively ( Haraga and Miller , 2003 ) . 
Transfected cells were seeded into 60 mm or 100 mm tissue culture dishes . 
Alternatively , HeLa cells were seeded into 100 mm tissue culture dishes and were infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain AH58 or JAF119 at an moi of 20 . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection or 17 h after infection the cells were washed twice with PBS and were lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 5 mM EDTA ) supplemented with Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics ) on ice for 30 min . 
The lysates were centrifuged at 10 000 r.p.m. for 30 min at 4 °C , and the superna-tants were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA-agarose antibody conjugate or anti-FLAG M2 afﬁnity gel ( Sigma ) for 4 h on a rotator at 4 °C . 
The supernatants were collected and the precipitates were washed six to seven times with lysis buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting . 
HA - , FLAG - and Myc-tagged proteins were detected with HA .11 ( Covance ) , anti-FLAG M2 ( Sigma ) and c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibodies ( BD Biosciences ) respectively . 
p38 was probed with anti-p38 MAPK rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , while PKN1 and PRK2 were detected with anti-PKN1 goat ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and anti-PRK2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( Cell Signaling Technology ) respectively . 
Phosphorylated PKN1 and p38 were blotted with rabbit anti-phospho-PRK1 ( Thr774 ) / PRK2 ( Thr816 ) and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK ( Thr180/Tyr182 ) antibodies respectively ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . 
The secondary anti-goat , anti-mouse and anti-rab-bit horseradish peroxidase antibody conjugates were from Amersham Biosciences . 
Luciferase assays
CHO-K1 or HeLa cells were transfected with 3 µg of pELAM-1-ﬂuc expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase from the NF-κB-dependent endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) -1 promoter ( Schindler and Baichwal , 1994 ) , 0.3 µg of pRL-TK expressing Renilla luciferase from the constitutive herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter ( Promega ) , and the indicated plasmids . 
In addition , cells stimulated via toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -4 were also transfected with 5 µg of pCDNA3 .1 / Zeo / mCD14 expressing mouse CD14 ( Underhill et al. , 1999 ) . 
RNA interference was performed by co-transfecting HeLa cells with 5 µg of PKN1-speciﬁc siGENOME SMARTpool Reagent or 5 µg of siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA ( Dharmacon ) . 
For testing the effect of PKN1 on NF-κB-dependent gene expression , pRC / CMV/PKN/AF3-FL ( Takahashi et al. , 1998 ) , which is a mamma-lian expression vector for the constitutively active PKN1 ( 561-942 ) - FLAG fragment , and pRC/CMV/PKN / AF3 ( K664E ) - FL ( Gao et al. , 2000 ) , which expresses the kinase-dead fragment PKN1 ( 561-942 , K644E ) - FLAG , were used at 5 µg per transfection . 
Transfected cells were incubated for 24 or 48 h ( RNAi ) − 1 before assaying . 
CHO-K1 cells were incubated with 100 ng ml Escherichia coli LPS ( Sigma ) or fresh medium , while HeLa cells were stimulated with 50 ng ml − 1 TNF-α ( Endogen ) or medium alone for 4 -- 5 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) in a Berthold LB9501 luminometer . 
Fireﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of Renilla luciferase . 
Statistical analyses
Values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples . 
Differences among groups were statistically analysed by a one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using the ANOVA1 function of MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . 
A value of P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant .
