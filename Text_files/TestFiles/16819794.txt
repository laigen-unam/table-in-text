A pattern recognition software PlatProm , which takes into consideration both sequencespeciﬁc and structure-speciﬁc features in the genetic environment of the promoter sites and identiﬁes transcription start points with a very high accuracy was used to reveal potentially transcribed regions in the genomes of two bacterial species . 
Along with the expected promoters located upstream from coding sequences PlatProm identiﬁed several hundred of very similar signals in other intergenic regions and within coding sequences . 
Homologous genes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium , containing potential promoters on the template strand are suggested as putative targets for regulations by antisense RNA-products ( aRNAs ) . 
Keywords : Promoters ; transcription ; untranslated RNAs ; antisense RNAs ; gene expression ; promoter-search software ; genome annotation . 
1. Introduction
Small regulatory RNAs or sRNAs in bacteria were discovered almost forty years ago . 
The ﬁrst species were found by chance on the basis of high abundance or functions related to protein synthesis or activity .1 -- 3 They act by multiple mechanisms utilizing RNA-RNA basepairing , RNA-protein interactions , and intrinsic RNA activity and regulate such a diverse cellular functions as transcription , translation , mRNA and protein stability and secretion . 
Since it has been realized that untranslated RNAs are important for the expression of many genes , their genome wide detection became a focus of attention , but small size and variable three dimensional structures of sRNAs have made this task rather dificult . 
Several systematic screens undertaken during the last ﬁve years revealed more than 70 novel sRNAs encoded in the genome of Escherichia coli4 -- 17 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Unlike the plasmid , bacteriophage or transposon antisense RNAs ( aRNAs ) , which are transcribed from the opposite strand of their target gene , most of these sRNAs are encoded in trans , without essential overlap with the adjacent genes on both strands . 
To some extent it may be due to the choice of the strategies used for their ﬁnding , mostly attuned to working with the intergenic regions . 
However the possibility of antisense transcription was also testiﬁed by the data of microarray analysis18 and directional cloning of short RNA species .8,9 Since most aRNAs should be expressed as independent units , the presence of transcription signals is required for their synthesis . 
This feature was exploited in the recent study ,17 where random ∼ 160 bp DNA fragments were fused to a promoterless lacZ reporter gene on multi-copy plasmid . 
Nearly half of the checked clones exhibiting expression of the reporter gene , had inserts mapping within or downstream of open reading frames ( ORFs ) . 
For six of the nine most active promoter-like sequences with orientation opposite to that of the ORF , RNA products were detected by RT-PCR , thus increasing the total number of putative antisense RNAs with veriﬁed expression up to fourteen ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Most of them may be produced from the promoters revealed by the PlatProm15 within coding sequences . 
In this study we used slightly improved versions of this software with a purpose to compare the sets of E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium genes containing potential promoters for antisense transcription and select the best candidates for experimental veriﬁcation .

2. Methods and Algorithms
2.1. Genomes
We have used DNA sequences of complete genomes of E.coli K12 ( GenBank accession number U00096 ) 19 and S.typhimurium LT2 ( NC 003197 ) .20 S.typhimurium was selected as the second model organism since it was previously used in comparative studies aimed to reveal sRNA genes within intergenic regions5 ,11 and has the largest number of known promoters among other closely related to E.coli bacteria . 
The speciﬁcation of coding regions were obtained from http://www.ebi.ac.uk . 
2.2. Promoter search software
The ﬁrst version of PlatProm15 was developed on the basis of 400 σ70-promoters initiating RNA synthesis from the single start point ( training set ) . 
This version identiﬁed 84.8 % promoters of testing compilation ( 290 known promoters with single or multiple transcription start points ) at the level when 0 false positives have been found in the control set of non-promoter DNA sequences ( 400 fragments ) . 
That means that the combination of sensitivity ( ( ( true positives ( TP ) ) / ( TP + false negatives ( FN ) ) ) × 100 = 84.8 % ) and speciﬁcity ( ( ( TN / ( TN + false positives ( FP ) ) ) × 100 = 100.0 % ) of our pattern recognition software is slightly better than in the case of algorithms based on neural networks ( 80.6 % and 99.14 % , respectively ) ; 21 logic grammar formalism ( 68.7 % and 82.23 % ) 22 and sequence alignment kernel ( 82 % and 84 % ) .23 Positions with maximal scores coincided with experimentally estimated start points or were located in the nearest two positions in ∼ 80 % cases , which is also better than usually reported ( < 50 % 24,25 ) . 
However the ﬁrst version of PlatProm recognized only 46.6 % of known promoters if the high level of reliability is required ( p < 0.00005 ) . 
That is why this software was further improved using 271 promoters from the training set , which were accurately recognized by PlatProm . 
The improved version ( PlatProm v. 1 ) identiﬁes 50.5 % of E.coli promoters and 55.2 % of 76 known S.typhimurium promoters with p < 0.00005 reliability . 
An analysis of any sequence by this software is available by request ( ozoline@icb.psn.ru ) . 
Similar to PlatProm the new version of this software combines consensus and weight matrix considerations for the particular sequence motives and structural elements located in the promoter regions but operates with only two types of weight matrices . 
The matrices of the ﬁrst type reﬂect distribution of nucleotides in the conservative elements ( − 35 and − 10 ) , dinucleotides near the start point of transcription ( position − 1 ) and in the 5 ′ - ﬂanking region of element − 10 ( `` extended − 10 element '' ) . 
These matrices are designed exactly as described by Hertz and Stormo24 and contain 6 × 4 ( or 1 × 16 ) scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized frequencies of the appearance of each nucleotide ( dinucleotide ) at each position of the preliminary aligned promoters . 
Occurrence frequency of particular nucleotides ( dinucleotide ) in genome was used for normalization . 
Allowed variations of the spacer length and the distance between the start point of transcription and the element − 10 were : 14 -- 21 and 2 -- 9 bp , respectively . 
That means that 64 alignments were tested for each sequence to ﬁnd the maximal score . 
Any deviations from the optimal spacer ( 17 bp ) and optimal distance ( 6 bp ) were penalized based on their frequencies . 
Optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation-maximization using several circles of sequence alignment and frequency coeficients reevaluation up to the constant values . 
The matrices of the second type reﬂect the presence of particular sequence elements , without scoring all their variants . 
Sequence motives interacting with RNA polymerase α-subunits or stabilizing the transcription complex by a properly induced bend were accounted by the set of 34 cascade matrices scoring the presence of these elements in 34 regions from − 225 to +60 . 
Di - , tri and tetranucleotides , which occurrence frequencies in particular positions are at least ﬁve standard deviations higher than in average in the control set of non-promoter sequences were used to specify these promoter regions . 
An example of such simpliﬁed matrix , accounting the presence of motives , dominant in the region − 76 / − 71 is shown in Table 1 . 
Positive scores represent log-probabilities to ﬁnd 5 ′ - end of each particular element in the positions of its preferred occurrence . 
The presence of the most signiﬁcant element ( ATAT ) was ﬁrst checked in the position where the probability to ﬁnd it is maximal ( − 73 ) , then the presence of another typical motive was veriﬁed in the adjacent position and so on in descending manner . 
Negative scores reﬂect the percentage of promoters lacking all elements specifying the region of interest . 
A large contribution to the sensitivity of the PlatProm is given by mixed A/T-tracts putatively participating in the polymerase sliding along the DNA .26 These elements are distributed with ∼ 1 and ∼ 1.5 helix turns periodicities . 
To take into account this regularity we scored the presence of paired , rather than single A/T-tracts : www ( n ) www ( w = A = T ; `` n '' -- 7 , 8 , 13 or 14 random base pairs ) in the region from − 139 to +11 . 
Ten cascade matrices very similar to that shown in Table 1 were used for this purpose . 
In addition to these sequence-speciﬁc and structure-speciﬁc features PlatProm also takes into account a possibility of promoters interacting with transcription factors . 
Ideal direct and inverted repeats ( 5 -- 11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp ) were considered as putative targets for complex formation with these proteins . 
Their presence was scored as natural logarithms of the lengths . 
Contributions given by repeated sequences , as well as structure-speciﬁc elements were reduced by coeficients estimated as ratio of average information content in the region of their presence and information content in the sixth position of aligned element − 35 . 
This reduction was done to balance endowments of these elements with contributions of conservative base pairs . 
The total score of the promoter likelihood was obtained as a sum of contributions of all accounted elements .

2.3. Sorting predicted promoters in respect to gene borders
The allowed distances between the predicted transcription start points and the coding sequences were deduced on the basis of positional coordinates typical for the known promoters of E.coli .15 Although ∼ 90 % of them are less than 250 bp far from coding sequences , some genes have leaders as long as 600 bp and more . 
That is why we considered 750 bp as the distance at which the predicted promoter may be ascribed to the downstream gene . 
The remaining promoter-like points were automatically sorted according to their location in respect to genes borders .

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Potential promoters within intergenic regions
PlatProm v. 1 predicted promoters upstream of 2636 E.coli and 2304 S.typhimurium genes ( similar genes , like two copies of rfbI in the genome of S.typhimurium were accounted independently ) . 
These sets contain 1228 and 1264 homologous genes , respectively . 
Of them 929 genes have predicted promoters in both bacterial species . 
Block `` E '' in Fig. 2 ( a ) schematically illustrates this overlap . 
Between genes transcribed convergently or from the opposite DNA strand PlatProm v. 1 revealed more than ﬁve hundred promoter-like sites in both genomes . 
They may be functional only if these intergenic regions possess additional so far unidentiﬁed genes . 
A total of 1493 non-overlapping sRNA genes are currently predicted in such regions in the genome of E.coli . 
Thus , the presence of functional promoters for their expression is also expected . 
Although location of these genes in the chromosome of different bacterial species may be completely independent from the neighboring genes , many predicted promoters are located near at least one gene homologous in both bacterial species . 
However , their strong comparison is ambiguous . 
3.2. Potential promoters for antisense transcription
Promoter-like signals revealed on the opposite strand of protein encoding sequences were in the main focus of this study . 
Antisense RNAs ( aRNAs ) synthesized from such promoters may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs or regulate their processing and stability . 
Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes , but so far they were not considered as typical for bacterial genes . 
Figure 1 represents the proportion among experimentally veriﬁed untranslated RNAs encoded by special genes and aRNAs . 
The production of only several species of aRNAs has been so far conﬁrmed by speciﬁc probes but their functionality as anti-messenger agents still remains to be elucidated . 
PlatProm v. 1 identiﬁed a total of 933 homologous genes containing putative promoters for antisense transcription in one or another bacterial species ( 595 and 600 in E.coli and S.typhimurium , respectively ) . 
The degree of overlapping for these sets is less than in the case of expected promoters upstream of coding sequences ( Fig. 2 ( b ) , block `` E '' ) . 
All genes composing overlapping set ( 262 species ) were previously tested for the synthesis of antisense RNAs using E.coli microarrays18 and in all cases such products were found . 
Although the data from the expression analysis can not be considered as strong evidence , they support a possibility that at least part of these genes may be subjected to antisense regulation . 
However the most serious problem hampering interpretation of these data and decreasing their signiﬁcance is a conservativeness of coding sequences . 
Even though , the promoter search software recognizes a speciﬁc pattern of signals , homologous genes , possessing intrinsic promoter-like sites in the genome of E.coli with high probability may also have them in the same place in the genome of S.typhimurium . 
Thus the question , to what extent an observed overlap may be explained by the sequence similarity was specially addressed . 
Figure 3 ( a ) shows correlation in the disposition of predicted start points for antisense transcription with respect to the 5 ′ - end of E.coli and S.typhimurium genes . 
Only ∼ 26 % of predicted sites are located within two helix turns from each other . 
Their appearance in the homologous genes of two bacterial species probably may be explained by simple sequence similarity ; however positional coordinates of ∼ 48 % of intrinsic promoters differ for more than 100 bp . 
The presences of such transcription signals obviously can not be explained by the conservativeness of coding sequences providing an evidence of their functional signiﬁcance . 
To further test this possibility we used a compilation of known S. typhimurium promoters as a training set and modify weight matrices of PlatProm v. 1 on the basis of frequency coeficients speciﬁc to this bacterium . 
The procedure of expectationmaximization performed with this set gave conservative elements ( TTGACT and TATWAT for − 35 and − 10 regions , respectively ) slightly different from these modules in the promoters of E.coli ( TTGACA and TATAAT ) . 
To some extent it may be due to the small size of training compilation ( 76 promoters ) . 
This modiﬁed protocol ( PlatProm v. 1S ) with p < 0.00005 predicted promoters in front of 3074 genes of S. typhimurium ( 1351 homologous to E.coli ) . 
This is more , than in the case of PlatProm v. 1 ( 2304 ) , implying that the modiﬁed program is a better model for the promoters of S.typhimurium ( ∼ 68 % , rather than 55.2 % of known S.typhimurium promoters have scores higher than the cutoff level ) , but the size of overlapping set remains practically unchanged ( Fig. 2 ( a ) , block `` S '' ) . 
At the same time , the number of genes , possessing putative promoters for antisense transcription in both bacterial species deﬁnitely increases ( Fig. 2 ( b ) , block `` S '' ) . 
However an opposite tendency is expected if this intersection is mainly based on the similarity of coding sequences . 
Positional coordinates of intrinsic promoters predicted by the program optimized for S.typhimurium transcription signals better correlate with disposition of E.coli promoters ( 0.68 , rather than 0.62 , Fig. 3 ) , implying that some promoters found by the modiﬁed program have location different from that predicted by the algorithm trained on E.coli promoter sequences . 
Figure 3 ( c ) illustrates this difference . 
Taken together we conclude that there are many similar genes in two bacteria , which possess intrinsic promoters for antisense transcription . 
Sequence similarity by itself can not explain this overlap for most genes . 
Thus , we suggest an overlapping set of genes , containing intrinsic promoters , as the list of best candidates for experimental veriﬁcation . 
Figure 4 demonstrates their functional belonging . 
Approximately 36 % of selected genes encode enzymes . 
Such gene species are dominant in all genomes . 
Their prevalence , therefore , has minor signiﬁcance . 
About 23 % of genes possessing putative promoters for antisense transcription in both bacteria encode proteins with unknown function . 
This is slightly less than in bacterial genomes ( 30 -- 40 % ) . 
Nearly 9 % encode proteins of different functions , which classiﬁcation is dificult . 
The remaining genes may be easily sub-grouped into four categories : genes encoding regulatory proteins , especially transcription regulators ; transport proteins ; membrane proteins and proteins involved in biosynthesis and processing of nucleic acids . 
The later group includes six genes encoding aminoacyl tRNA synthetases ( proS , thrS , pheT , asnS , gltX and dinP ) . 
This is quite interesting since biosynthesis of these enzymes exempliﬁes recently discovered riboswitch type of regulation . 
Different types of RNA molecules may probably be involved in structural remodeling of these mRNAs . 
Among transcription factors , there are two global regulators which biosynthesis may be controlled by aRNAs : Dps ( starvation and stress induced DNA-binding protein ) and H-NS ( global repressor , affecting more than 35 genes and operons in E.coli ) . 
Both of them are abandoned in bacterial cells . 
Biosynthesis of H-NS depends on sRNA DsrA , which blocks translation of H-NS-mRNA .27 Our data indicate that another RNA molecule may affect the cellular content of this global regulator .

Genes of ﬁve functional groups are listed . 
Two other groups are shown only schematically . 
Genes marked by ( e ) belong to the overlapping set only if both genomes were scanned by PlatProm v. 1 . 
Genes marked by ( s ) belong to the overlapping set only if genome of S.typhimurium was scanned by PlatProm v. 1S . 
Other genes belong to overlapping set in both cases . 
Coordinates of intrinsic promoters are available by request : ozoline@icb.psn.ru . 
An experimental data , assuming antisense transcription from within coding sequences of E.coli genome have been obtained by Vogel et al. ,8 who cloned and sequenced cDNA copies of short ( 50 -- 400 b ) RNA products picked out from the total fraction of cellular RNAs . 
The 21 RNAs generated from antisense strand of 20 genes were selected . 
Nine of them may be produced as run-through transcripts from the neighboring genes . 
In four other cases downstream genes have opposite orientation , thus their transcription may be initiated from promoters located in the coding sequences of upstream gene . 
An appearance of the remaining seven RNA species assumes purposeful antisense transcription . 
PlatProm predicts promoters for two such transcripts in both bacteria . 
Kawano et al. 9 observed several short RNA products complementary to coding sequences of genes encoding proteins ( mtgA , yhdL , yhdZ , yhbQ , rtcR , yjiW and hsdS ( RyjC-aRNA ) , sgcA ( RyjB-aRNA ) , b1420 ( SokB ) , gefL ( SokC ) ) and sRNAs ( gadY , k4 ) . 
Most of these RNAs may be produced as run-through transcripts from upstream genes , but ﬁve ( yhdZ-aRNA , gadY-aRNA , yjiW-aRNA , b1420 - aRNA and ryjC-aRNA ) may be synthesized from their own promoters , predicted by PlatProm . 
In the recent study Kawano et al. 17 detected expression of another 6 aRNAs ( within rhsE , yfjN , yiaO , yjcE , ydiM and yehI ) using plasmid-based screen for promoter activity . 
We found suitable promoters for aRNA-products of rhsE , yiaO , ydiM and yehI . 
Two of these genes ( yiaO , ydiM ) have homologs in S.typhimurium and also possess potential transcription signals for antisense transcription . 
Finally , Saetrom et al. 16 identiﬁed sRNAs I002 , I014 and I209 , which are complementary to ORF135 , ecnA and yihQ . 
The 5 ′ - ends of I002 and I014 have been mapped . 
In the case of I002 it exactly matches to the predicted by PlatProm transcription start point , but in the case of I014 predicted promoter is located 70 base pairs closer to the expected coding sequence . 
S.typhimurium also has ecnA and yihQ genes , but only yihQ has intrinsic promoter . 
Our predictions are , therefore , in rather good correlation with available experimental data .
