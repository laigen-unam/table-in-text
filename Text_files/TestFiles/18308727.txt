Here , the PduX enzyme of Salmonella enterica is shown to be an L-threonine kinase used for the de novo synthesis of coenzyme B12 and the assimilation of cobyric acid ( Cby ) . 
PduX with a C-terminal His tag ( PduX-His6 ) was produced at high levels in Escherichia coli , purified by nickel affinity chromatography , and partially characterized . 
31P NMR spectroscopy established that purified PduX-His6 catalyzed the conversion of L-threonine and ATP to L-threonine-O-3-phosphate and ADP . 
Enzyme assays showed that ATP was the preferred substrate compared with GTP , CTP , or UTP . 
PduX displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both ATP and L-threonine and nonlinear regression was used to determine the following kinetic constants : Vmax 62.1 3.6 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 ; Km , ATP 54.7 5.7 M and Km , Thr 146.1 8.4 M. Growth studies showed that pduX mutants were impaired for the synthesis of coenzyme B12 de novo and from Cby , but not from cobinamide , which was the expected phenotype for an L-thre-onine kinase mutant . 
The defect in Cby assimilation was corrected by ectopic expression of pduX or by supplementation of growth medium with L-threonine-O-3-phosphate , providing further support that PduX is an L-threonine kinase . 
In addition , a bioassay showed that a pduX mutant was impaired for the de novo synthesis of coenzyme B12 as expected . 
Collectively , the genetic and biochemical studies presented here show that PduX is an L-threonine kinase used for AdoCbl synthesis . 
To our knowledge , PduX is the first enzyme shown to phosphorylate free L-threonine and the first L-threonine kinase shown to function in coenzyme B12 synthesis . 
cobyric acid ( Cby ) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( 3 , 5 ) . 
Corrinoid assimilation begins with transport into the cytoplasm by the B12 uptake system ( btu ) followed by synthetic steps specific to a particular corrinoid ( Fig. 1 ) ( 6 -- 8 ) . 
In the case of Cbi , an adenosyl group is added to the central cobalt atom to form adenosyl-Cbi , which is phosphoryl-ated to adenosyl-Cbi-phosphate ( 9 , 10 ) . 
Subsequently , the nucleotide loop is assembled in three steps to form AdoCbl ( 3 ) . 
Last , a portion of the AdoCbl is converted to MeCbl ( 11 , 12 ) . 
Many of the steps used for Cbi assimilation are also used for the assimilation of Cby as well as the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl ( Fig. 1 ) . 
A key difference is that Cby assimilation and de novo synthesis require ( R ) -1 - amino-2-propanol-O-2-phosphate ( AP-P ) , whereas the conversion of Cbi to the B12 coenzymes does not ( 3 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Prior studies showed that AP-P was produced by decarboxylation of L-threonine-O-3-phosphate ( L-Thr-P ) , which was catalyzed by the CobD enzyme ( 13 ) . 
These findings predicted that an L-threonine ( L-Thr ) kinase would be required for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl , and the assimilation of Cby . 
However , this enzyme has not been identified in any system . 
In S. enterica , AdoCbl and MeCbl are required cofactors for three enzymes ( 5 ) . 
MeCbl-dependent methionine synthase is used to convert homocysteine to methionine ( 14 ) ; AdoCbl-de-pendent diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia lyase are required for growth on 1,2-propanediol ( 1,2-PD ) and ethanol-amine , respectively ( 15 , 16 ) . 
The genes specific for 1,2-PD utilization ( pdu ) are found in a large contiguous cluster ( 15 , 17 ) . 
Bioinformatic studies tentatively suggest that the last gene of the pdu operon ( pduX ) encodes an L-Thr kinase ( 18 ) . 
The PduX protein has homology to the GHMP ( galactokinase , homo-serine kinase , mevalonate kinase , and phosphomevalonate kinase ) family of kinases and a number of PduX homologues are encoded by genes located proximal to genes for AdoCbl biosynthesis . 
However , no experimental studies of PduX homologues have been conducted in any system . 
Here , we present genetic and biochemical studies that show PduX is an L-Thr kinase used for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and the assimilation of Cby . 
To our knowledge , PduX is the first enzyme shown to phosphorylate free L-Thr . 
The B12 coenzymes ( adenosylcobalamin , AdoCbl , and meth-ylcobalamin , MeCbl ) are required cofactors for at least 15 different enzymes that are widely distributed in nature and are essential for human health ( 1 , 2 ) . 
AdoCbl and MeCbl are synthesized de novo by certain prokaryotes and from corrinoid precursors by a broader range of organisms ( 1 , 2 ) . 
The synthesis of B12 has been studied extensively in Salmonella enterica ( 3 , 4 ) . 
This organism carries out de novo synthesis under anaerobic conditions and assimilates corrinoids such as vitamin B12 , cobinamide ( Cbi ) ,2 and

Bacterial Strains , Media , and Growth Conditions -- The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
The minimal medium used was NCE supplemented with 0.4 % 1,2-PD , 1 mM MgSO4 , 50 M ferric citrate , 1 M 5,6-dimethylbenzimida-zole , and 3 mM ( each ) valine , isoleucine , leucine , and threonine . 
LB ( Luria-Bertani ) medium was the rich medium used . 
General Molecular Methods -- Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously ( 19 ) . 
Plasmid DNA was purified by Qiagen ( Chatsworth , CA ) products according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Following restriction digestion and PCR amplification , DNA was purified by Promega Wizard PCR Preps ( Madison , WI ) . 
Restriction digests were carried out using standard protocols ( 19 ) . 
For ligation of DNA fragments , T4 DNA ligase was used according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Electroporation was carried out as previously described ( 17 ) . 
Protein Methods -- PAGE was performed by using Bio-Rad Ready gels and Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II electrophoresis cells according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Following gel electrophoresis , Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was used to stain proteins . 
The protein concentration of solutions was determined by using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent . 
Construction of Plasmids for Production of PduX and PduX-His -- PCR was used to amplify the pduX coding 6 sequence from pEM55 ( 17 ) . 
The primers used for amplification were 5 - GCCGCCAGATCTATGCGCGCACACTATTCG-TACCT-3 and 5 - GCCGCCAAGCTTATCACTGCAGTT-TGACCCCGCCA-3 . 
The reverse primer used for fusing six histidine residues to the C terminus of PduX was 5 - GCCGC-CAAGCTTATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTGCAGT - TTGACCCCGCCA-3 . 
These PCR primers introduced BglII and HindIII restriction sites that were used for cloning into vector pTA925 or pLac22 ( 20 ) . 
Following ligation , clones were introduced into Escherichia coli DH5 by electroporation , and transformants were selected by plating on LB agar supplemented with 25 g ml 1 kanamycin ( pTA925 ) or 100 g ml 1 ampicillin ( pLac22 ) . 
Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants . 
The presence of insert DNA was verified by restriction analysis or PCR , and the DNA sequence of selected pduX clones was determined . 
Clones with the expected DNA sequence were used for further study . 
DNA Sequencing -- DNA sequencing was carried out by the DNA facility of Iowa State University Office of Biotechnology using automated sequencing equipment from Applied Biosystems Inc. . 
Growth Curves -- Growth media are described in the figure legends . 
To prepare the inoculum , 2 ml LB cultures were incubated overnight at 37 Â°C , and then cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in growth curve medium . 
Media were inoculated to a density of 0.15 absorbance units , and the cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a BioTek Synergy microplate reader and 48-well flat-bottom plates ( Falcon ) . 
Each well was inoculated with 0.3 ml of culture and incubated at 37 Â°C as described ( 21 ) . 
Corrinoid Extraction and Quantification -- Selected strains of S. enterica were grown aerobically on 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 1 % 1,2-PD , 1 M 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole , and 5 M CoCl2 overnight at 37 Â°C in 17 100-mm test tubes . 
Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris , pH 7.0 . 
The cell suspension was transferred into 3-ml serum vials . 
The vials were sealed and flushed with helium for 3 min . 
The suspension was autoclaved for 10 min at 121 Â°C , then placed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 25,000 g for 1 h at 4 Â°C . 
The corrinoids present in the supernatant were quantified using a bioassay based on the AdoCbl-dependent growth of S. enterica strain BE86 on the ethanolamine minimal medium . 
Growth measurements were carried out using a microplate reader as described above for `` growth curves . '' 
Quantitation was based on a standard curve of vitamin B12 concentration versus maximum cell density of BE86 . 
The assay was linear from 0 to 20 nM vitamin B 2 12 with an r value of 0.9843 . 
Growth of pduX Expression Strains -- The E. coli strains used for expression of pduX were grown on 400 ml of LB supplemented with 25 g ml 1 kanamycin at 16 Â°C in a New Brun-swick Scientific , Innova 4230 , refrigerated shaker incubator with shaking speed at 275 rpm . 
Cells were grown to an absorb-ance of 0.6 -- 0.8 at 600 nm , and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl - D-thiogalactopyranoside . 
Cells were incubated at 16 Â°C with shaking at 275 rpm for an additional 18 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min at 4 Â°C using a Beckman JA-10 rotor . 
the 1,2-PD degradative pathway is intact , and that corrinoid uptake is unimpaired because a single system is used for uptake of Cbi , Cby , and other corrinoids ( 6 -- 8 ) . 
It also shows that pduX mutants can carry out all the steps needed for the conversion of Cbi to AdoCbl ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Thus , the inability of pduX mutants to use Cby can be attributed to a defect in the conversion of Cby to AdoCbi-phosphate ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This process requires four enzymes : 1 ) an adenosyltransferase ( CobA ) ; 2 ) an enzyme that converts AdoCby to AdoCbi-phosphate ( CbiB ) ; 3 ) an L-Thr-P decarboxylase ( CobD ) ; and 4 ) an L-Thr kinase ( 9 , 13 , 22 ) . 
The CobA , CbiB , and CobD enzymes have been characterized in S. enterica ( 9 , 13 , 22 ) . 
Hence , the above studies suggest that PduX is an L-Thr kinase used for the conversion of Cby to AdoCbl . 
A pduX Deletion Mutation Is Complemented by Ectopic Expression of pduX -- A pduX expression plasmid ( pLac22-pduX ) was introduced into a pduX deletion mutant by electroporation . 
This plasmid fully corrected the growth defect of a pduX mutant on 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby ( the generation time was 6.9 h compared with 6.1 h for wild-type ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In contrast , plasmid without insert had little effect on growth ( the generation time is 17.4 h ) . 
This showed that the observed phenotype ( poor growth with Cby ) resulted from the pduX mutation but not from polarity or an unknown mutation . 
Supplementation of Growth Media with L-Threonine Phosphate Substantially Corrects the Growth Defect of a pduX Mutant -- In many cases , biosynthetic mutants are corrected by supplementation of growth medium with a downstream metabolite . 
Studies conducted here showed that 100 M L-Thr-P substantially corrected the growth defect of a pduX mutant on 1,2-PD minimum media containing Cby ( Fig. 4 ) . 
With 100 M L-Thr-P the generation time for a pduX deletion mutant was 8.8 h compared with a generation time of 8.3 h for the wild-type strain . 
Both strains reached a maximum optical density at 600 nm of about 0.4 . 
These results indicate that PduX has a role in the synthesis of L-Thr-P . 
AP Is Ineffective for Correction of a pduX Deletion Mutant -- Prior studies showed that a cobD mutant was partly corrected for the synthesis of MeCbl from Cby by addition of AP to growth media ( 23 ) . 
This and subsequent findings indicated that an unknown kinase phosphorylated AP to AP-P bypassing the cobD defect ( Fig. 1 ) ( 13 ) . 
Therefore , PduX was tested for AP kinase activity . 
However , results were negative . 
Both a cobD mutant and a pduX cobD double mutant grew similarly on minimal glucose medium supplemented with Cby and AP indicating that S. enterica converts AP to AP-P in the absence of PduX ( data not shown ) . 
Concentrations of AP between 1 and 20 mM were tested and in no case did the PduX strain grow better than the PduX strain . 
The studies described above were conducted in a metE background under conditions where the conversion of Cby to MeCbl is required for growth in minimal medium ( 24 ) . 
Tests of PduX for AP kinase activity using 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby and enzyme assays with purified recombinant enzyme were also negative ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , results indicate that PduX does not phosphorylate AP . 
PduX Is Needed for S. enterica Growth on Minimal Ethanol-amine Medium Supplemented with Cby , but Not on Similar Medium Supplemented with Cbi -- The pduX gene is the last gene in the pdu operon ( 17 ) . 
Measurable expression of this operon requires 1,2-PD ( 15 , 25 -- 27 ) . 
This raised the question of whether PduX supports ethanolamine degradation . 
Results showed that a pduX mutant was unable to grow on ethanol-amine minimal medium supplemented with Cby , but grew well on similar medium supplemented with Cbi ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In contrast , wild-type S. enterica grew well on ethanolamine medium supplemented with either Cby or Cbi . 
The generation times of S. enterica with Cbi and Cby were 4.3 and 4.4 h , whereas those of the pduX mutant were 4.3 and 33.1 h , respectively . 
In addition , the growth defect of the pduX mutant on ethanolamine with Cby was fully corrected by ectopic expression of pduX , showing this defect resulted from the pduX mutation , but not from polarity or an unknown mutation ( data not shown ) . 
Hence , pduX is used for AdoCbl synthesis even in the absence of 1,2-PD , which is required for transcription of the pdu operon ( 15 , 17 , 26 , 27 ) . 
This finding is surprising to us because it suggests that pduX has a different regulatory pattern than upstream genes presumed to be in the same operon . 
Thr-P but Not AP Supplementation Allows Growth of a pduX Mutant on Ethanolamine with Cby -- The growth defect of a pduX mutant on minimal ethanolamine medium-supple-mented Cby was corrected by addition of Thr-P , but not by addition of AP-P ( data not shown ) . 
This was similar to results obtained with 1,2-PD ( above ) and provided further evidence that PduX is an L-Thr kinase . 
Production of MeCbl Sufficient to Support Methionine Bio-synthesis Is Independent of PduX -- S. enterica metE mutants require MeCbl for methionine biosynthesis ; hence , L-Thr kinase should be required for growth of metE strains on minimal medium supplemented with Cby ( Fig. 1 ) ( 14 ) . 
However , results showed that a metE pduX double mutant grew only slightly slower than wild-type on minimal glucose medium supplemented with Cby . 
Doubling times for the wild-type , metE mutant , and metE pduX double mutant were 2.0 , 2.0 , and 3.8 h , respectively . 
This suggested that PduX contributed to MeCbl synthesis , but S. enterica also produced a second L-Thr kinase that allowed substantial growth of a metE mutant as is further explained under `` Discussion . '' 
PduX Is Used for the de Novo Synthesis of B12 -- L-Thr kinase is expected to be required for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl ( Fig. 1 ) ( 13 ) . 
Therefore , we used a bioassay to quantitate de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl by S. enterica , a pduX mutant and a cbiB mutant ( as negative control ) . 
These strains produced B12 in the following amounts ( picomole/g of wet cells ) : 2620 112 , 280 11 , and undetectable , respectively . 
Thus , a pduX mutant produced about 11 % as much B12 as the wild-type strain . 
S. enterica BE86 was used for the bioassay . 
This strain grows on ethanolamine minimal medium supplemented with complete corrinoids such as AdoCbl and MeCbl , but not on similar medium supplemented with corrinoids such as AdoCby-P , which might accumulate in a pduX mutant . 
High-level Expression of the PduX-His6 Protein -- PduX with a C-terminal His6 tag ( PduX-His6 ) was produced at high levels via an E. coli T7 expression system and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography ( Fig. 6 ) . 
This procedure allowed the isolation of PduX-His6 that appeared nearly homogeneous following Coomassie staining . 
The apparent molecular mass of PduX-His6 by SDS-PAGE was 35 kDa , which was close to the expected value of 33.7 kDa . 
ADP and L-Threonine-O-3-phosphate Are the Products of the PduX-His6 Reaction -- 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the products of the PduX reaction . 
Fig. 7A shows the 31P NMR spectrum of a kinase reaction mixture prior to addition of purified PduX-His6 enzyme . 
The triplet centered at 22.5 ppm corresponds to the - phosphate of ATP ; the two doublets centered at 7.1 and 11.6 ppm correspond to the - and - phos-phates of ATP , respectively . 
Fig. 7B shows the 31P NMR spectrum of the ADP standard . 
The two doublets centered at 7.2 and 11.2 ppm correspond to the - and - phosphates of ADP , respectively . 
Fig. 7D shows the complete reaction mixture after 2 h of incubation at 37 Â°C with 200 g of purified PduX-His6 . 
The triplet corresponding to the - phosphate of ATP ( 22.5 ppm ) is absent . 
The two doublets centered at 7.2 and 11.2 ppm of the complete reaction mixture correlate well with the two doublets of the ADP standard ( Fig. 7B ) . 
The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the phosphate group of L-Thr-P ( Fig. 7C ) . 
Fig. 7E shows the intermediate reaction mixture after 30 min of incubation at 37 Â°C with 200 g of purified PduX-His6 . 
It shows genes raising the possibility of functional diversity among PduX homologues . 
Here , we presented in vitro and in vivo evidence that the pduX gene of S. enterica encodes an L-Thr kinase involved in the de novo synthesis AdoCbl and the assimilation of Cby . 
31P NMR spectroscopy indicated that purified PduX-His6 catalyzes the conversion of ATP and L-Thr to ADP and L-Thr-P ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Enzyme assays indicated the ATP was the preferred substrate for PduX compared with GTP , CTP , and UTP . 
The Vmax of PduX ( 62 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 ) is within the range determined for other B12 biosynthetic enzymes that have relatively low activity in accord with the low levels of AdoCbl and MeCbl that are required to support B - dependent processes 12 ( 5 ) . 
The Km value of PduX for ATP ( 55 M ) is well below the ATP pool sizes in rapidly growing cells ( 1 -- 3 mM ) ( 33 ) . 
The Km value for L-Thr ( 146 M ) is close to measured pool sizes ( 70 -- 400 M ) for E. coli , which is a close relative of S. enterica ( 34 ) . 
Thus , in vitro studies demonstrated that purified recombinant PduX has L-Thr kinase activity with kinetic parameters suitable to a role in AdoCbl synthesis . 
In addition to the above in vitro studies , genetic tests dem-onstrated that PduX has a role in the synthesis of AdoCbl in vivo . 
A bioassay and growth tests showed that a pduX deletion mutant was impaired for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and for the assimilation of Cby . 
In addition , the growth defects of a pduX mutant were corrected by addition of L-Thr-P to minimal media indicating that PduX is needed for L-Thr-P synthesis . 
A point of note is that bioassays found B12 in cultures grown under aerobic conditions . 
It is well established that S. enterica only synthesizes B12 de novo in the absence of oxygen ( 35 ) . 
The bioassays conducted here and unpublished studies done in our laboratory indicate that S. enterica synthesizes B12 under aerobic incubation conditions at high cell densities .3 Presumably , oxygen is depleted by cell respiration allowing B12 synthesis . 
This helps explain the paradoxical observation that S. enterica synthesizes B12 only in the absence of oxygen , but requires oxygen for degradation of ethanolamine and 1,2-PD as sole carbon and energy sources ( 5 ) . 
The genetic tests performed here also indicated that a pduX mutant synthesized enough MeCbl to support substantial growth of a metE mutant . 
This suggests that S. enterica expresses an L-Thr kinase in addition to PduX , but raises the question why is this second kinase unable to support ethanol-amine or 1,2-PD degradation ( Figs. 2 and 5 ) . 
One explanation is that the second kinase is induced during growth on glucose . 
Alternatively , the activity of the second kinase might be insufficient for 1,2-PD and ethanolamine degradation . 
A pduX mutant grew slowly on 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby ( Fig. 2 ) suggesting a second kinase with low activity . 
Prior studies showed that the MeCbl needed to support growth of a metE mutant ( methionine biosynthesis ) was about 100-fold less than the amount of AdoCbl needed to support 1,2-PD and ethanolamine degradation . 
Hence , a second L-Thr kinase that has low activity compared with PduX is indicated . 
To our knowledge , PduX is the first enzyme reported to transfer a phosphoryl group to free L-Thr . 
Sequence similarity indicates that PduX is a member of the GHMP kinase family ( 18 ) . 
This family includes members that transfer the - phos-phoryl group of ATP to acceptors such as mevalonate , homo-serine , galactose , and developmental protein Xol-1 ( 36 ) . 
A feature of PduX we think is interesting is that it phosphorylates free L-Thr , which is also required for protein synthesis . 
Presumably , PduX would need to be regulated to prevent L-Thr depletion or a futile cycle that needlessly consumes ATP . 
However , regulation of the activity of the PduX enzyme has not been studied .

The gel contained 12 % acrylamide and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue . 
enzyme activity was also determined . 
Results showed that the rate 
of reaction was proportional to PduX-His6 concentration from 0.006 to 6 M when 200 M ATP and 500 M L-Thr were used as substrates . 
Linear regression yielded an r2 value of 0.998 . 
Km and Vmax Values for PduX -- Purified PduX-His6 displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both ATP and L-Thr ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Based on nonlinear regression , the Km values for ATP and L-Thr were 54.7 5.7 and 146.1 8.4 M , respectively . 
The enzyme Vmax was 62.8 3.6 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 when L-Thr was varied and 61.4 3.6 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 when ATP was varied . 
The average of these two values is 62.1 3.6 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 . 
Similar kinetic constants were derived from double-reciprocal plots . 
The Km values for ATP and L-Thr were 60.9 9.7 and 127.0 11.3 M , respectively . 
Vmax values 31 were 58.6 6.2 nmol min 1 mg of FIGURE 7 .

When the Km values for ATP were determined , saturating levels clearly that the intermediate mixture contains L-Thr as well as of L-Thr ( 500 M ) were added to assay mixtures while varying both ATP and ADP ( Fig. 7F ) . 
Hence , these results indicate that the concentration of ATP . 
Similarly , saturating levels of ATP ADP and L-Thr-P are the products of the PduX reaction .

With ATP as the substrate , the specific activity of purified PduX-His6 DISCUSSION was 56.3 nmol min 1 mg of protein 1 . 
In the absence of ATP , no activity was detected . 
In the absence of PduX , - Thr , or both , Work done in a number of laboratories has defined many L activity decreased by 90 % . 
The remaining 10 % activity appears steps in the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl ( 3 , 5 , to have resulted from ATP-dependent background fluores - 28 -- 32 ) . 
Of particular relevance to this work are the studies cence . 
Thus , enzyme assays indicate that PduX has L-Thr kinase reported by Brushaber et al. ( 13 ) , which showed the CobD activity .
