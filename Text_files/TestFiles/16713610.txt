Abstract 
Infection of Salmonella enterica with lytic mutants of either P22 or SE1 bacteriophages triggers the expression of its DNA damage-inducible SOS response through a lexA-dependent pathway . 
This induction of the SOS system strictly requires the presence of the bacteriophage kil gene . 
Accordingly , plasmid overexpression of the kil gene also promotes the S. enterica SOS network induction . 
Furthermore , S. enterica Gifsy prophages are induced following the infection with SE1 and P22 lytic derivatives . 
The observed data reveal a hitherto unknown SOS system-mediated fail-safe mechanism of resident prophages against infection with heteroimmune lytic bacteriophages and suggest a novel role for the kil family of proteins .

Introduction
The bacterial SOS system comprises a battery of genes aimed at guaranteeing cell survival in the presence of extensive DNA damage ( Walker , 1984 ) . 
The SOS response is induced by the activation of the RecA protein after binding to single-stranded DNA fragments ( ssDNA ) ( Sassanfar and Roberts , 1990 ) . 
Activated RecA ( RecA * ) promotes the autocatalytic cleavage of the Ala84-Gly85 bond of the Escherichia coli LexA repressor ( Little , 1991 ) . 
This cleavage , mediated by LexA residues Ser119 and Lys156 , is similar in mechanism to that observed for serine proteases ( Luo et al. , 2001 ) and prevents LexA from binding to its specific recognition motif in the promoter region of SOS genes . 
The cleavage of the LexA protein in many other bacterial species belonging to different Phyla follows the same mechanism that in E. coli ( Campoy et al. , 2003 ; Fernández de Henestrosa et al. , 1998 ; Winterling et al. , 1998 ) . 
The set of genes induced during the SOS response of both E. coli ( Kenyon and 
Walker , 1980 ) and Salmonella enterica ( Smith et al. , 1991 ) includes , among others , error-prone polymerases ( UmuDC and DinB ) , excision repair proteins ( UvrAB ) , and a protein determining the reversible inhibition of cell division ( SulA ) . 
In addition to the genes directly regulated by LexA , the induction of the SOS response via ssDNA activation of RecA promotes cleavage of other repressors . 
Among these , several lytic cycle repressors of temperate bacteriophages have been shown to undergo RecA * - mediated autocatalytic cleavage through their serine protease domain ( Roberts and Devoret , 1983 ; Sauer et al. , 1982 ) , which is very similar to that of LexA . 
Another class of temperate bacteriophages carry a gene ( tum ) encoding an anti-repressor protein that is under direct negative control of LexA ( Shearwin et al. , 1998 ) . 
Whether it is due to the direct RecA * - mediated cleavage of the phage repressor or to the binding of SOS-induced Tum protein to the repressor , the net result of both mechanisms is the inactivation of the phage repressor as a result of DNA damage . 
Infection of bacterial cells with either non-temperate bacteriophages or lytic mutants of temperate bacteriophages interferes with several cellular processes ( Nechaev and Severinov , 2003 ) , including the normal replication of th bacterial chromosome ( Smith and Levine , 1965 ) . 
Furthermore , and depending on the bacteriophage , either a significant amount of ssDNA ( Inciarte et al. , 1980 ) or a massive degradation of the bacterial chromosome ( Schmiger and Buch , 1975 ; Woodworth-Gutai et al. , 1972 ) may be generated during the development of the bacteriophage lytic cycle . 
Nevertheless , the putative impact of bacteriophage lytic cycle development on the bacterial SOS response has not been analyzed to date . 
In the present work , the behavior of the S. enterica SOS system after cell infection with either wild type or lytic mutants of P22 and SE1 bacteriophages has been studied . 
In addition , and taking advantage of the fact that S. enterica contains several prophages ( Bunny et al. , 2002 , FigueroaBossi et al. , 1997 ) , the effect of the infection with either P22 or SE1 derivatives on these resident prophages has also been analyzed .

Results and discussion
Infection of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium with P22 and SE1 lytic c2 mutants induces the SOS system 
To analyze the behavior of the S. enterica SOS regulon during phage infection , the expression of its recA gene was measured by quantitative RT-PCR assays . 
Total RNA of S. enterica cells was extracted after infection with either wild-type P22 bacteriophage or a lytic derivative carrying a mutation inactivating the c2 gene which encodes the lytic cycle repressor ( Table 1 ) . 
Fig. 1 shows how recA expression in P22c2-infected cells remained invariable up to 10 min post-infection . 
By 20 and 30 min following phage infection , however , the level of recA transcription has clearly increased ( Fig. 1A ) . 
In contrast , no significant change in recA transcription levels was detected when the wild-type P22 bacteriophage was used ( Fig. 1A ) .

b Position of each mutation with respect to the translational starting point of c2 gene of either P22 or SE1 bacteriophages or their derivatives . 
c The 129-bp deletion introduced into the kil gene is described in Materials and methods section . 
To confirm that the recA gene induction is not P22 exclusive , the effect of infection with another S. enterica specific bacteriophage ( SE1 ) ( Llagostera et al. , 1986 ) was also studied . 
In accordance with the abovementioned results , a similar increase in recA expression is detected after infection with a c2 mutant ( Table 1 ) of SE1 ( Fig. 1A ) , while no change in the recA transcription level can be appreciated when the SE1 wild-type temperate bacteriophage is used for S. enterica infection ( Fig. 1A ) . 
To further determine whether this induction was LexA-dependent , a lexA ( Ind ) S. enterica derivative was constructed ( Table 2 ) , and its recA expression after bacteriophage infection was also analyzed . 
As expected , the lexA ( Ind ) mutant strain did not show any increase in recA transcription levels after infection with either P22 or SE1 c2 mutant bacteriophages ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Likewise , a S. enterica recA-defective mutant ( Table 2 ) did not show bacteriophage-mediated SOS response activation ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Phage infection-mediated induction of the SOS system requires the bacteriophage kil gene 
As many other bacteriophages ( Casjens et al. , 2004 ; Juhala et al. , 2000 ; Perna et al. , 2001 ; Sato et al. , 2003 ) , λ and P22 phages ( Greer , 1975 ; Vander Byl and Kropinski , 2000 ) contain a gene annotated as kil that has been hypothetically linked to the bacterial cell-cycle regulation , since its expression has been shown to transiently block cell division ( Semerjian et al. , 1989 ; Sergueev et al. , 2002 ) . 
Similarly , sequencing of the SE1 genome has revealed the presence of a kil gene with a 74 % amino acid sequence identity to that of P22 . 
( Busquets et al. , 2005 ) . 
Because of the relationship between the induction of the SOS response and the inhibition of cell division ( Walker , 1984 ) , we decided to analyze here the effect of infection with a kil knockout mutant of both P22 and SE1 lytic derivatives on the behavior of S. enterica recA expression . 
An internal 129-bp deletion was introduced in the P22 bacteriophage kil gene as described in Materials and methods and , through RT-PCR studies , it was confirmed that the transcription of genes located downstream of kil is not affected ( data not shown ) . 
Afterwards , a spontaneous clear mutant of the P22 kil derivative was isolated ( Table 1 ) , and the effect upon the SOS response was analyzed . 
Fig. 2A shows that the c2 lytic derivative of P22 kil mutant is unable to trigger the expression of the S. enterica recA gene . 
The same results were obtained when S. enterica was infected with an SE1 kil lytic mutant , suggesting that the kil gene product might be responsible for the observed SOS induction . 
To further confirm this hypothesis , the kil gene was cloned into the pUA1085 plasmid ( Table 2 ) , downstream the Ptac promoter that is negatively regulated by the LacI protein . 
As expected , real-time RT-PCR assays clearly pointed out that the IPTG-mediated overexpression of the kil gene induces the recA expression ( Fig. 2B ) . 
The function of the kil gene has been traditionally assumed to be related to cell division inhibition , although the mechanism by which the kil gene would block cell divisio has yet to be elucidated . 
However , and since SOS induction leads to cell filamentation due to expression of the cell division inhibitor SulA ( Schoemaker et al. , 1984 ) , the above data suggest that the kil cell division inhibitory effect ( Semerjian et al. , 1989 ; Sergueev et al. , 2002 ) might be actually mediated by SulA after bacteriophage-triggered expression of the host SOS response .

In each case , error bars indicate the standard error of the mean from three independent experiments ( each in triplicate ) . 
Gifsy prophages are induced by infection with heteroimmune lytic bacteriophages 
The inactivation of the lexA gene and the consequent deregulation of the SOS response in S. enterica stimulates the expression of several genes ( e.g. , tum , STM2605 or STM1048 ) encoded in Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 prophages ( Bunny et al. , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , we analyzed here the effect of P22c2 infection on the lysogenic cycle stability of Gifsy prophages using several approaches . 
Firstly , the expression of genes STM2605 and STM1048 of the Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 prophages , respectively , was studied . 
Induction of these two genes can be taken as an indicator of lytic gene expression , since it has been shown that neither is a moron , and each is located in the morphogenesis module of their respective prophages ( Bunny et al. , 2002 ; Frye et al. , 2005 ) . 
The behavior of these genes was analyzed at 20 min post-infection with a P22c2 mutant . 
Levels of expression of STM2605 and STM1048 increased about 3 - to 4-fold in these conditions ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Likewise , the mRNA levels of Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 tum genes were also enhanced following P22c2 infection ( Fig. 3A ) , even though the induction levels for all the monitored Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 genes were lower than those observed following mytomicin-C induction of the SOS response ( Fig. 3B ) . 
The same results were obtained when the expression levels of these Gifsy genes were analyzed after SE1c2 mutant infection ( data not shown ) . 
On the other hand , tum , STM1048 and STM2605 expression was not stimulated in a S. enterica lexA ( Ind ) genetic background ( data not shown ) . 
Secondly , and since this method has been recently employed to monitor Gifsy prophage induction ( Alonso et al. , 2005 ; Frye et al. , 2005 ) , the amount of Gifsy phage produced DNA was monitored by real-time PCR experiments . 
In agreement with the abovementioned results for prophage gene expression ( Fig. 3 ) , a significant increase of intracellula 
Gifsy DNA concentration was observed after P22c2 infection ( Fig. 4A ) , and accordingly , the same rise in intracellular Gifsy DNA concentration was obtained when SE1c2 bacteriophage was used ( data not shown ) . 
Finally , an increase in the production of Gifsy infective particles was also detected 80 min after P22 ( Fig. 4B ) or SE1 bacteriophage infection ( data not shown ) . 
The P22 genome encodes the ant gene whose product has been shown to block the c2 repressor of this bacteriophage , as well as that of those of other related phages ( Levine et al. , 1975 ; Prell , 1978 , 1979 ) . 
It must be noted that this ant gene is negatively regulated by the product of the P22 arc gene ( Levine et al. , 1975 ; Susskind and Botstein , 1978 ) , and that P22 mutants presenting a constitutive expression of the ant gene exhibit a virulent phenotype ( Levine et al. , 1975 ) . 
In this context , it could be argued that the stimulatory effect upon the lytic cycle of Gifsy phages described in this work was due to the effect of an overproduction of the ant product , which could then inhibit the action of the Gifsy c2 repressor . 
However , it must be stressed that the SE1 phage genome lacks the ant gene ( Busquets et al. , 2005 ) , thus providing a convenient negative control for this effect . 
Several mechanisms of defensive strategy against hetero-immune infecting phages , as rexAB or sieAB ( Hofer et al. , 1995 ; Ranade and Poteete , 1993 ; Shinedling et al. , 1987 ) , have been described for prophages . 
These mechanisms aim at guaranteeing prophage persistence and include evasive strategies , like super-infection exclusion or lysogenic conversion of the host cell wall , as well as active mechanisms , such as targeted DNA restriction systems . 
Nonetheless , our data demonstrate that , at least in S. enterica , infection of a lysogenic cell by a heteroimmune lytic bacteriophage triggers the SOS system , and that this response , in turn , induces lytic cycle of the resident prophages . 
Thus , SOS-mediated induction of prophage lytic cycle in lysogenic cells may not have evolved only as an early warning mechanism of relatively infrequent DNA damage , but also , as a hitherto unknown fail-safe mechanism to prevent loss of these prophages in an evolutionary arms race with competing lytic phages . 
Finally , and given that bacterial virulence factors are frequently encoded in the genome of temperate bacter-iophages ( Boyd and Brussow , 2002 ) , it must be noted that the prophage induction mechanism described in this work may be a relevant dissemination pathway of these factors among bacterial populations .

Materials and methods
Bacteria and plasmids
S. enterica strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 2 . 
S. enterica was grown either at 37 ° or 42 ° in LB . 
When necessary , ampicillin ( 100 μg / ml ) , kanamycin ( 100 μg / ml ) or chloramphenicol ( 34 μg / ml ) were added to the bacterial culture . 
DNA extractions , cloning , transformation and other molecular techniques used in this work were performed as described elsewhere ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . 
Construction of P22 and SE1 kil mutants and isolation of their c2 bacteriophage derivatives 
P22 and SE1 kil defective mutants were obtained from their respective lysogenic strains via a PCR-based gene replacement method ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
The antibiotic resistance cassette from the pKD3 plasmid was amplified using KilP1 and KilP2 70-nt long oligonucleotides . 
These primers contain 20-mers that prime with pKD3 vector ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) and 50-mers presenting kil homology ( from position − 21 to +33 and from +150 to +200 with respect to the kil translation start point , in KilP1 and KilP2 primers , respectively ) . 
After PCR product transformation into S. enterica ATCC14028 strain lysogenic for P22 phage , and containing the pKD46 expressing the λ Red-recombinase vector ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) , kil defective chloramphenicol resistant derivatives were selected . 
Afterwards , and using the pCP20 FLP-recombinase expression vector ( Cherepanov and Wackernagel , 1995 ) , the chloramphenicol resistance cassette was eliminated . 
Spontane-ous clear mutants of either P22 or SE1 wild type , as well as of their kil defective derivatives , were isolated as described ( Davis et al. , 1980 ) . 
Afterwards , their c2 gene was amplified from bacteriophages DNA , with the appropriate oligonucleotides , and sequenced twice by the dideoxy method ( Sanger et al. , 1977 ) on an ALF Sequencer ( Amersham-Pharmacia ) using the Thermo Sequenase Cy5 Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit ( Amersham Biosciences ) . 
Mutations in the c2 gene of each virulent bacteriophage derivative used in this work are listed in Table 1 .

( A ) Increase of relative intracellular Gifsy bacteriophage DNA amount following P22c2 mutant infection . 
Samples were taken 10 , 30 , 50 , and 70 min after P22c2 adsorption to S. enterica cells . 
It is worth noting that the lysis of P22c2-infected bacteria occurred 80 min post-infection . 
The DNA increase was measured by quantitative PCR and it is the ratio of the STM2633 ( from Gifsy-1 ) and STM1008 ( from Gyfsy-2 ) relative gene amount in infected cells with respect to that of noninfected cells . 
The behavior of both Gifsy genes was simultaneously analyzed . 
The intracellular Gifsy DNA quantity was normalized to that of the trpA gene as nonbacteriophage gene indicator .

The relative increase is the concentration of the infective particles detected after each treatment with respect to that of non-treated cultures . 
In all cases , error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of three independent experiments ( each in triplicate ) 
Construction of S. enterica mutants
S. enterica serovar typhimurium ATCC14028 lexA ( Ind ) strain , was obtained by transduction using GE13 strain ( Salles et al. , 1987 ) as a donor ( Table 2 ) . 
Among kanamycin-resistant tranductants , the presence of the lexA ( Ind ) mutation was confirmed through β-galactosidase assay after introduction of the pGE108 plasmid ( Table 2 ) which contains a LexA-regulated cea ∷ lacZ fusion ( Salles et al. , 1987 ) . 
The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium recA knockout mutant was constructed as described before ( Campoy et al. , 2002 ) . 
Briefly , the S. enterica ATCC14028 recA gene was amplified , cloned in the pGEMT vector and a 2.2 kb cassette encoding kanamycin resistance ( ΩKm ) was inserted into its ClaI internal site . 
After cloning the recAΩKm construction into the pGP704 suicide vector ( de Lorenzo et al. , 1990 ) , the obtained plasmid was introduced by triparental mating into a S. enterica ATCC14028 RifR derivative . 
Kanamycin-resistant transconjugants were screened for the loss of vector-mediated ampicillin resistance and the presence of the recA mutation was confirmed by PCR . 
Afterwards , the recAΩKm construction was transferred by transduction to a S. enterica ATCC14028 wild-type strain as described before ( Campoy et al. , 2002 ) . 
The absence of P22int7 ( HT ) prophage in kanamycin-resistant tranductants was determined by streaking the mutants onto green plates in which S. enterica P22 lysogenic colonies were dark green whereas non-lysogenic cells formed light-colored colonies ( Davis et al. , 1980 ) . 
Afterwards , the presence of recAΩKm construction was confirmed by PCR . 
Cloning and overexpression of kil gene
The kil gene was amplified by PCR using Ndekil ( GGAATTCCATATGACCATTACGCCTG ) and Bamkil 
( CGGGATCCGTCATGAACATGACGCCTC ) oligonucleo-tides carrying NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at their 5 ′ - end , respectively . 
The PCR product was digested using NdeI and BamHI endonucleases and cloned into a pUA1085 plasmid ( Table 2 ) , placing the kil gene downstream the Ptac promoter to obtain plasmid pUA1092 . 
Afterwards , the construction was confirmed by sequencing , and the plasmid pUA1092 was electro-transformed into S. enterica ATCC14028 , giving rise to the UA1823 strain . 
For kil overexpression , IPTG ( 1 mM ) was added to an exponential growing culture of the UA1823 strain . 
After 2-h incubation at 37 °C , total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit ( Quiagen ) . 
Quantitative RT-PCR and PCR experiments
Quantitation of the expression and the DNA amount for several genes in S. enterica cells following bacteriophage infection was analyzed through quantitative RT-PCR and PCR analysis , respectively , according the following procedure . 
P22 or SE1 bacteriophages were added to a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cfu into fresh-growing S. enterica cultures previously treated with KCN ( 5 mM ) during 10 min , allowing absorption for 25 min without agitation . 
Afterwards , the mixture was centrifuged , and the pellet was resuspended in LB media and incubated with agitation at 37 °C . 
Samples were periodically taken and either total RNA or DNA extractions were performed using RNeasy Mini kit ( Quiagen ) or Easy-DNA ( Invitrogen ) , respectively . 
For RT-PCR assays , absence of DNA in RNA extractions was confirmed by PCR analysis . 
The level of recA , STM2605 , STM1048 or tum genes transcription was in all cases , and in concordance with standard methodology ( Brooks et al. , 2001 ; Campoy et al. , 2003 ) , normalized with respect to that of trpA gene , since this gene has been shown to be non-inducible by DNA damage in the Gamma Proteobacteria ( Courcelle et al. , 2001 ) . 
The increase in intracellular DNA concentration for Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 bacteriophages was measured , as described previously , by analyzing the behavior of STM2633 and STM1008 genes , respectively ( Frye et al. , 2005 ) . 
Both genes were tested simultaneously using the same primer pair in infected and non-infected cells . 
In all cases , the amount of Gifsy DNA was normalized with respect to that of S. enterica trpA gene as a non-bacteriophage gene indicator . 
When required , S. enterica ATCC14028 cultures were treated with mitomycin-C as described before ( Campoy et al. , 2003 ) . 
Measurement of in vivo Gifsy phage induction
Samples of S. enterica ATCC14028 cultures either infected with P22c2 or SE1c2 bacteriophages or treated during 2 h with mitomycin-C were taken out , centrifuged and filtered . 
Afterwards , the presence of Gifsy infective particles in these samples was determined as described before ( Figueroa-Bossi and Bossi , 1999 ) by using S. enterica MA6684 as an indicator strain . 
The MA6684 strain is resistant to both P2 and SE1 bacteriophages because it is a galE defective mutant ( Table 2 ) .
