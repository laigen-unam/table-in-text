Corrinoid ( vitamin B12-like ) cofactors contain various - axial ligands , including 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ( DMB ) or adenine . 
The bacterium Salmonella enterica produces the corrin ring only under anaerobic conditions , but it can form `` complete '' corrinoids aerobically by importing an `` incomplete '' corrinoid , such as cobinamide ( Cbi ) , and adding appropriate - and - axial ligands . 
Under aerobic conditions , S. enterica performs the corrinoid-dependent degradation of ethanolamine if given vitamin B12 , but it can make B12 from exogenous Cbi only if DMB is also provided . 
Mutants isolated for their ability to degrade ethanolamine without added DMB converted Cbi to pseudo-B12 cofactors ( having adenine as an - axial ligand ) . 
The mutations cause an increase in the level of free adenine and install adenine ( instead of DMB ) as an - ligand . 
When DMB is provided to these mutants , synthesis of pseudo-B12 cofactors ceases and B12 cofactors are produced , suggesting that DMB regulates production or incorporation of free adenine as an - ligand . 
Wild-type cells make pseudo-B12 cofactors during aerobic growth on propanediol plus Cbi and can use pseudo-vitamin B12 for all of their corrinoid-dependent enzymes . 
Synthesis of coenzyme pseudo-B12 cofactors requires the same enzymes ( CobT , CobU , CobS , and CobC ) that install DMB in the formation of coenzyme B12 . 
Models are described for the mechanism and control of - axial ligand installation . 
Coenzyme B12 ( Ado-Cbl ) and vitamin B12 ( CN-B12 ) ( Fig. 1 ) include the base 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ( DMB ) as an - axial ligand . 
Prokaryotes , the only producers of vitamin B12 , make `` complete '' corrinoid cofactors with a variety of alternative - axial ligands , including benzimidazoles , phenols , and purines ( 16 , 52 ) . 
These alternative corrinoids may be functional equivalents of coenzyme B12 for many bacterial enzymes , but functional differences are suggested by the selectivity of the human assimilatory protein , intrinsic factor for cobalamin , the DMB-containing vitamin B12 ( 53 ) . 
Under strictly anaerobic growth conditions , Salmonella enterica synthesizes corrinoids de novo ( 44 ) and installs either adenine ( to form pseudo-coenzyme B12 [ Ado-pseudo-B12 ] ) or 2-methyl-adenine ( to form adenosyl-factor A ) as an - axial ligand ( 22 ) . 
If even trace amounts of oxygen are present , DMB-containing B12 ( cobalamin [ Cbl ] ) is also made ( 39 ) . 
When grown aerobically on glucose , S. enterica can not synthesize the corrin moiety , which must be supplied as an `` incomplete '' corrinoid , such as cobinamide ( Cbi ) , with its corrin ring and aminopropanol side chain . 
Under these conditions , coenzyme B12 is made , with DMB as the - axial ligand ( 20 ) .

substrates and that the ( CN ) 2Cbi supplied as the corrin ring source is not a normal CobA substrate . 
Here , the origins and installation of - axial ligands are approached genetically using an unexpected feature of S. enterica . 
While S. enterica can use exogenous Cbi to produce B12 cofactors ( cobalamins ) during aerobic growth on glucose ( 20 ) , it makes only about 100 molecules per cell ( 2 ) . 
This is apparently insufﬁcient B12 coenzyme to support growth on ethanolamine ( 5 ) unless the DMB base is also supplied . 
That is , under these conditions , cells neither make sufﬁcient DMB nor install an alternative ligand to allow corrinoid-dependent aerobic growth on ethanolamine ( 5 ) . 
This situation allowed positive selection of mutants that can grow on ethanolamine plus Cbi without added DMB . 
These mutants were expected to show either increased endogenous DMB production or to install an alternative base as an - axial ligand . 
All of the mutants made pseudo-B12 cofactors , which have adenine as an - axial ligand , and most of these mutations affected purine metabolism so as to increase the intracellular level of free adenine base . 
The same set of enzymes ( CobUSTC ) installs either adenine base ( to form pseudo-B12 ) or DMB ( to form vitamin B12 ) . 
A model suggests how the choice is made . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and transposons . 
Strains were derived from S. enterica ( ser-ovar Typhimurium ) LT2 ( Table 1 ) . 
Media and chemicals . 
Pseudo-vitamin B12 ( CN-pseudo-B12 ) was isolated as described previously ( 16 ) . 
Regular agar was from EMD Inc. , Gibbstown , NJ . 
Noble agar was from U.S. Biological , Swampscott , MA . 
Rich medium was nutrient broth ( NB ) ( 0.8 % ; Difco Laboratories ) supplemented with NaCl ( 5 g/li-ter ) . 
Minimal media were variants of E medium , which contains citrate . 
NCE medium lacks citrate ( 25 ) , and NCN medium contains neither citrate nor a nitrogen source ( 4 ) . 
Ethanolamine hydrochloride ( Aldrich ) was used as a carbon source in NCE medium ( 40 mM ) , as a nitrogen source in NCN medium ( 10 mM ) with glycerol ( 27 mM ) . 
CN-Cbl ( 100 nM ; Sigma Chemical Co. ) was the usual exogenous vitamin B12 source . 
Amino acids and purines were added to minimal medium at the concentrations previously recommended ( 9 ) . 
NB agar medium contained antibiotics at the following concentrations : ampicillin , 30 g/ml ; chlor-amphenicol , 20 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 g/ml ; and tetracycline , 20 g/ml . 
Solid media were prepared by adding agar ( 1.5 % ; EMD ) to E , NCN , NCE , or NB medium . 
Testing growth in liquid medium using ethanolamine as a nitrogen source . 
The growth medium was NCN medium with glycerol ( 0.2 % ) and ethanolamine ( 10 mM ) . 
To test for growth of strain TR10000 in this medium , duplicate Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 25 ml of growth medium were set up containing ( i ) 0 nM cobinamide , ( ii ) 20 nM cobinamide , ( iii ) 20 nM cobinamide and 20 nM DMB , and ( iv ) 20 nM CN-B12 . 
Inoculation was by 1,000-fold dilution of a culture of TR10000 grown in NCE medium with glycerol . 
Growth was assessed by measuring optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) after 24 h. Selection of nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants . 
Cells were spread onto NB plates , and a small crystal of 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine ( NG ) ( Aldrich ) was placed in the center of the plate . 
Plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and then replica plated to minimal NCE plates containing 2 % Noble agar ( U.S. Biological ) , 40 mM ethanolamine HCl ( Sigma ) , and 100 nM cobinamide dicya-nide [ ( CN ) 2-Cbi ] ( Sigma ) and incubated at 37 °C . 
After 48 to 72 h , 27 mutant colonies appeared in a circle around the killing zone of the NG . 
Preparation and extraction of corrinoids . 
Cultures ( 200 ml ) of the apt-18 deletion mutant ( TT25778 ) were grown aerobically on minimal NCE medium containing 40 mM ethanolamine and 1 M cobinamide . 
Culture A contained no DMB ; culture B contained 1 M DMB . 
Both cultures were grown aerobically for 72 h at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm . 
Strains TT25752 through TT25751 were grown aerobically for 24 h in minimal NCE medium containing 27 mM glycerol , 40 mM ethanolamine , and 1 mM dicyanocobinamide . 
In all cases , corrinoids were extracted and prepared for high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry ( HPLC/MS ) analysis by the method previously described ( 5 ) , in which extracted cyanidated corrinoids were washed with water on a Sep-Pac column and eluted with methanol prior to drying and resuspension in water . 
HPLC methods . 
An HPLC system from Waters Alliance 2795 ( Bedford , MA ) was used to deliver solvent at a ﬂow rate of 250 l/min . 
The solvents used in the gradients in the mobile phase were solvent A ( 94.5 % water , 5.0 % methanol , and 0.5 % formic acid [ by volume ] ) and solvent B ( 99.5 % methanol and 0.5 % formic acid [ by volume ] ) . 
The times and gradients were as follows : 0 to 5 min , 0 % solvent B ; 45 min , 100 % solvent B ; 45 to 58 min , 100 % solvent B ; and 60 min , 100 % solvent A . 
The column was an XTerra MS C18 column ( 3.5 - m particle size ) ( 3.0 - by 100-mm column ) ( catalog no. 186000418 ; Waters , Bedford , MA ) , coupled to an XTerra C18 column ( 3.5 - m particle size ) ( 3.0 - by 20.0-mm column ; ( catalog no. 186000640 ; Waters , Bedford , MA ) guard column was used . 
The column temperature was kept constant at 30 °C . 
For UV-visible light signal detection , the Waters 996 PDA detector was used as a UV-visible light detector with a wavelength range of 210 to 620 nm , resolution of 1.2 nm , and sampling rate of 1 spectrum/s . 
MS. All the exact mass measurement experiments were performed in positive mode on a Waters/Micromass LCT using orthogonal acceleration -- time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer ( Waters/Micromass , Manchester , United Kingdom ) . 
Sample source conditions were as follows : capillary voltage of 3,150 V , sample cone voltage of 30 V , extraction cone voltage of 3 V , source temperature of 110 °C , and desolvation temperature of 300 °C . 
Transfer optics settings were follows : rf ( radio frequency ) lens , 300 V ; rf dc ( direct current ) offset-1 4-OV ; rf dc offset-2 6-OV ; aperture , 2.0 V ; acceleration , 200.0 V ; focus , 2.0 V ; and steering , 0.5 V. Analyzer settings were as follows : multichannel plate detector , 2,600 V ; ion energy , 31.0 V ; tube lens , 9.0 V ; grid , 2 31.0 V ; time-of-ﬂight tube , 4,599 V ; and reﬂectron , 1,813 V . 
The pusher cycle time was 75 s , data ﬁles were acquired in continuum mode , and spectra were stored from m/z 100 to 2,100 with a 2.1-second scanning cycle consisting of a 2.0-second scan and a 0.1-second interscan time . 
The cone gas and desolvation gas were set at 50 and 675 liter/hour , respectively . 
Lock spray parameters were identical to sample setting parameters . 
Lock spray sampling frequency mode was set at 5 , i.e. , every ﬁfth spectrum generated was the signal from the lock spray inlet . 
Analyzer pressure measured 7.75 10 7 mbar . 
MassLynx 4.0 software ( Waters/Micromass , Manchester , United Kingdom ) was used for instrument control , data acquisition , and data evaluation . 
Mapping of mutations . 
Strains were isolated with Tn10 inserted near new DMB-independent mutations as described previously ( 23 ) . 
A collection of about 100,000 random Tn10 ( tetracycline-resistant ) insertion mutants were pooled and used to prepare transducing phage . 
This lysate served as the donor in a cross with the mutant to be characterized . 
Tetracycline-resistant transductants were selected and screened to identify those that lost the recipient mutant phenotype when they acquired tetracycline resistance . 
This is expected to occur when the Tn10 insertion is coinherited with a nearby wild-type allele of the recipient mutant gene . 
Each of several Tn10 insertions was sequenced and tested for linkage to the whole set of DMB-independent mutations . 
This gave the genera map positions of several mutations and indicated the region in which sequence determination might identify them . 
Sequencing of Tn10 insertion sites . 
Single-primer PCR was used to amplify join points between Tn10 insertions and chromosomal DNA . 
The single primer used for PCR was TP93 ( ACCTTTGGTCACCAACGCTTTTCC ) , which is homologous to the right arm of the Tn10dTet . 
The resulting PCR fragment was sequenced using the nested primer TP91 ( ATCATTAGGGGATTCATCAG ) . 
Construction of mutations by linear transformation . 
( i ) Deletion of the apt gene . 
The chloramphenicol resistance ( Cmr ) cassette was PCR ampliﬁed from strain TT24696 using primers TP1864 ( ATGACCGCGACTGCACAGCAGCT TGAGTTTCTCAAAAACACACCAAACACCCCCCAAAACC ) and TP1865 ( TCAATGCCCTGGAAACGGCACCAGGCTATAACAGGTAATCCACA CAACCACACCACACCAC ) , whose 5 ends are homologous to the ends of the apt sequence . 
The ampliﬁed fragment was electroporated into strain TT22971 , which carries a plasmid with the Red genes of phage lambda ( 8 ) , selecting Cmr on NB plates with 20 g/ml chloramphenicol . 
Successful deletion was conﬁrmed by PCR characterization of the region from the ﬁnal strain ( TT25778 ) . 
( ii ) Deletion of the amn gene . 
Primers TP1712 ( GATCGCCTGGAGGAGC TATACGAGCAGTCGGTTAACGCGCCACCAAACACCCCCCAAAACC ) and TP1713 ( TGAGTGCAAACGATCACCTTCTGCGCGTAGTAAATCAA TAGCACACAACCACACCACACCAC ) were used to amplify a kanamycin resistance ( Knr ) cassette . 
The ampliﬁed fragment was electroporated into strain TT22971 , and recombinants were selected on NB plates containing kanamycin ( 50 g/ml ) . 
The 5 ends of this fragment support recombination to integrate the Knr determinant in place of the amn coding sequence . 
After recombination , the amnA59 : : Knr ( sw ) deletion [ ( sw ) indicates a constructed ( swap ) mutation in which the indicated sequence element replaces the reading frame of the affected gene ] was moved by transduction into the wild-type S. enterica strain TR10000 . 
( iii ) Construction of an amn : : lacZ transcriptional fusion . 
Primers TP1981 ( AGCTGTCGCCTGCTGCTGGACAGGAGCGGAAGAGGCGTATCACA CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC ) and TP1982 ( AGAACCGCCTCCCGCTAAG GCTTCATTCAGCCACTTTCCACACACAACCACACCACACCAC ) were used to amplify a fragment including lacZ and a Cmr determinant ( in strain TT25797 ) . 
The ampliﬁed fragment was electroporated into strain TT22971 , which carries a plasmid with the Red recombination genes of phage lambda ( 8 ) . 
The sequences at the 5 ends of this fragment allow recombination to generate an amn : : lacZ fusion allele that expresses LacZ from the amn promoter ; this allele was transduced into the wild-type strain TR10000 to form TT25784 . 
( iv ) Deletion of the amn promoter and coding sequence . 
Primers TP1990 ( CCAGTACCCTTCTTTTTGAGCGATGATGGTGGCGCTAAGACACACA ACCACACCACACCAC ) and TP1991 ( TGAGTGCAAACGATCACCTTCTG CGCGTAGTAAATCAATAGCACCACCAAACACCCCCCAAAACC ) were used to amplify a Knr determinant and generate a fragment whose 5 ends supported recombination events that allow the Knr determinant to replace the promoter and coding sequence of the amn gene of strain TT25784 ( see above ) . 
The resultant DNA was electroporated into strain TT25784 containing the - Red recombinase plasmid pKD46 ( 8 ) , and 50 g/ml kanamycin was used to select inheritance of the incoming cassette . 
The resulting strain , TT25785 , is isogenic with TT25784 but has no promoter for the lacZ sequence . 
In-frame deletions of cobU and cobS genes . 
Chromosomal in-frame deletion mutations were constructed for the cobU and cobS genes using linear transformation . 
Each deleted region was replaced by an inserted chloramphenicol resistance ( Cmr ) cassette ﬂanked by FLP recombination target ( Frt ) sites , which did not disrupt the reading frame . 
Primers used to amplify the Cmr cassette prior to recombination were TP1778 ( GCACGTAGTGGTAAAAGCCGTCATGCTGA AGCCTTAATTGTGAAGTTCCTATACTTTCTAGAGAATAGGAACTTCC ACCAAACACCCCCCAAAACC ) and TP1779 ( ACCTGAGACTACCAGCC AGACCTCATCCGCCGCTGCCGCCGAAGTTCCTATTCTCTAGAAAGT ATAGGAACTTCACACACAACCACACCACACCAC ) for cobU and primers TP1780 ( ATGCTCGCTTTTATTAGCCGCTTGCCCGTACCGTCACGCCTG AAGTTCCTATACTTTCTAGAGAATAGGAACTTCCACCAAACACCCCC CAAAAC ) and TP1781 ( GATCAATTCACCAAGTTCGATCGCCGCGCCCA GCGTATCGGAAGTTCCTATTCTCTAGAAAGTATAGGAACTTCACAC ACAACCACACCACACCAC ) for cobS . 
After the Frt-Cmr-Frt sequence was recombined in place of the normal gene sequence , the Cmr cassette was removed by recombination of the Frt sites induced by transducing in the temperaturesensitive pCP20 plasmid which encodes Frt recombinase . 
The plasmid was then removed by overnight growth of cells at 37 °C , leaving a single in-frame Frt sequence at the site of the deletion . 
The constructed deletions were each transduced by a P22-mediated cross into a strain with a wild-type genetic background . 
The crosses were veriﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the mutant region and DNA sequencing of the deletion endpoints

Alternative `` complete '' corrinoids in S. enterica . 
The CN ( ) derivatives are formed in the process of extracting corrinoids from cells . 
A methyl group ( not shown ) can also serve as a - axial ligand and is involved in methyl transfer reactions . 
The corrin moiety is provided to cells as dicyanocobinamide ( CN ) Cbi , which has only the 2 aminopropanol side chain and no ligand nucleotide ; in the presence of CN ions , it has CN as both the - and - axial ligand . 
FIG. 2 . 
Pathways for formation of complete corrinoids . 
In the an-aerobic de novo pathway , the - axial ligand adenosine is added to cobyrinic acid diamide ( CobA ) , followed by four amidations and addition of the aminopropanol side chain to produce Ado-Cbi . 
Under aerobic conditions , the corrin ring is supplied as ( CN ) 2Cbi , which is adenosylated by CobA to produce Ado-Cbi . 
The aminopropanol side chain of this corrin is activated by the addition of GDP ( CobU ) , and the - axial ligand loop is completed by replacing GMP with a nucleoside of either DMB or adenine ( CobS and CobC ) , thereby generating a complete corrinoid . 
CobT produces the dinucleotide that donates the nucleoside group . 
Note that the corrin ring compound ( CN ) 2Cbi is not the natural substrate for the CobA enzyme .

RESULTS
Conditions that prevent synthesis or installation of any - axial cobalt ligand . 
Wild-type S. enterica can use ethanol-amine as an aerobic source of carbon and energy only when both Cbi and DMB are provided ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The Cbi requirement reﬂects the inability to synthesize the corrinoid precursor in the presence of oxygen . 
The requirement for DMB suggests that cells make insufﬁcient DMB and can insert no alternative - axial ligand into `` complete '' corrinoids under these conditions . 
Use of exogenous DMB requires CobT enzyme ( Fig. 3B ) , which is thought to exchange DMB with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD to form - DAD ( -5,6 - dimethylbenzimida-zole-5 - - [ 9 - adenine ] - dinucleotide DMB-R-P-P-R-Ade ) ( 30 ) . 
Selection of mutants able to use ethanolamine aerobically without added DMB . 
Mutants were sought that could grow on ethanolamine plus Cbi without exogenous DMB . 
Wild-type S. enterica ( strain TR10000 ) was plated on rich medium with a crystal of the mutagen NG . 
The mutagenized bacterial lawn was replica plated to minimal medium containing ethanol-amine and Cbi ( 100 nM ) , but no DMB . 
While these conditions do not support growth of the population as a whole , a ring of colonies grew at the position corresponding to the edges of NG killing zone on the plate with rich medium . 
The 27 independent mutants isolated in this way are listed in Table 1 and described below . 
Figure 4A and C show the growth of two representative mutants ( described below ) ; all others exhibited similar growth phenotypes . 
DMB-independent growth required the CobT enzyme ( Fig. 4B and D ) , which is known to be necessary for the addition of DMB as an - axial ligand ( 30 , 55 ) . 
All DMB-independent mutants make pseudo-B12 coenzymes ( - axial adenine ) . 
Mutants were grown on NCE medium with ethanolamine and Cbi and with glycerol added to enhance growth ; the same results were obtained when ethanolamine was the sole carbon source . 
Corrinoids were extracted in the presence of excess cyanide and fractionated on a C18 HPLC column without CN ions in the buffer as described in Materials and Methods . 
All of the mutants tested produced pseudo-B12 cofactors , isolated as CN-pseudo-B12 ( pseudo-vitamin B12 ) , which has adenine as the - ligand . 
No cyanocobalamine CN-B12 ( DMB base ) was detected . 
Figure 5A shows the CN-Cbl and - CN-pseudo-B12 standards , and Fig. 5B shows the corrinoids extracted from cells of the apt-18 mutant . 
On the basis of accurate MS measurements ( Fig. 5D ) , peaks 1 and 3 are both mono-CN-pseudo-B12

( pseudo-vitamin B12 ) , which appears in two forms due to the process used to extract pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
The extraction in the presence of CN ions converts corrinoids to dicyano forms . 
When CN is removed , a mixture of monocyano forms ( or ) is generated . 
This mixture was subjected to HPLC fractionation before it had been converted to the - CN isomer ( pseudo-vitamin B12 ) , which is the equilibrium form in the presence of traces of CN ion . 
Only the - CN isomer ( peak 3 ) allows the adenine attached to the nucleotide loop to act as the - ligand ; this form runs with the standard ( 19.38 min ) . 
According to the MS data and UV-visible light spectral evidence , peak 1 is suggested to be the monocyano ( - CN ) form , which runs differently , because - CN prevents adenine from coordinating with cobalt . 
The chemical background for the above interpretation has been described previously ( 23a ) . 
All of the mutants yielded these two CN-pseudo-B12 forms following growth on ethanolamine plus ( CN ) 2Cbi . 
Peaks 2 and 5 in Fig. 5B are two monocyano ( and ) isolation forms of the corrin precursor Ado-Cbi-GDP , a cya-nidated derivative of the activated corrin compound [ Ado ( ) - Cbi-GDP ] , a known intermediate formed when CobU enzyme acts on Ado-Cbi ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Peak 4 is one of the monocyano ( or ) derivative of Cbi-PO4 , the preceding intermediate in the pathway ; the second monocyano isomer of this intermediate is present but only in very small amounts . 
These monocyanidated precursors of pseudo-B12 coenzymes were found for all of the mutants described below following growth on ( CN ) 2Cbi . 
When the same mutants were grown with both DMB and ( CN ) 2Cbi , the extracted corrinoids included two isolation forms of CN-B12 ( CN-Cbl vitamin B12 with DMB as the lower ligand ) , rather than CN-pseudo-B12 ( pseudo-vitamin B12 ) . 
Data for the apt-18 deletion mutant are shown in Fig. 5C . 
Mass measurements and UV-visible light spectral evidence demonstrated that both forms were mono-CN-Cbl , i.e. , complete B12 corrinoids with DMB attached to the nucleotide loop , and are assumed to form as described above for pseudo-B12 . 
The ﬁrst ( more polar ) form is inferred to be the - CN-B12 ( i.e. , vitamin B12 ) , and it elutes at the same time as the CN-B12 standard . 
This result demonstrates that although mutants are able to make pseudo-B12 cofactors , they make vitamin B12 only when DMB is provided . 
Genetic characterization of the mutations that cause pseudo-B12 synthesis during aerobic growth on ethanolamine . 
Insertions of transposon Tn10 were isolated near several of the mutations ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
Four distinct Tn10 insertions were identiﬁed , each closely linked ( in transduction crosses ) to a different subset of the mutations . 
Each mutation with a linked insertion was moved into an unmutagenized wild-type strain ( TR10000 ) using Tn10 as the selective marker , demonstrating that the DMB-independent growth phenotype was due to a single , heritable mutation in the region . 
The junction sequence between each Tn10 element and the adjacent chromosomal region ( see Materials and Methods ) revealed the genomic position of the insertion . 
Most of the point mutations were identiﬁed by determining the sequence of the chromosomal region surrounding the linked Tn10 insertion ( Table 2 ) . 
Mutations that cause loss of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ( Apt ) . 
Seventeen of the 27 mutations affect the apt gen 
The amnA mutations that allow DMB-independent growth appear to increase the level of nucleosidase activity ( AMP 3 adenine ribose-5-PO4 ) . 
They might do this by increasing the half-life of the enzyme or by causing resistance to feedback inhibition . 
Consistent with this idea , these mutations were rarer than those in apt ( 6 compared to 17 of 27 ) , and three of the ﬁve independent amn mutations sequenced have the same base change . 
In addition , a constructed amnA deletion mutation , amnA59 : : Knr ( sw ) , did not cause a DMB-independent growth phenotype . 
Furthermore , the amnA59 deletion mutation eliminated the activity of several DMB-independent mutations unlinked to amnA , suggesting that their DMB-indepen-dent phenotype depends on Amn activity , which they may increase or deregulate . 
Mutations in Amn all affect the Amn catalytic domain . 
The Amn protein has been studied at both a functional ( 17 , 27 , 46 -- 48 ) and structural ( 14 , 58 ) level . 
The enzyme is feedback inhibited by inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) ( 47 , 48 ) and activated by MgATP ( 48 , 49 ) . 
Structural studies have identiﬁed the binding sites for the substrate , AMP , and for Pi , a feedback inhibitor of the Escherichia coli enzyme ( 58 ) . 
The primary protein sequence of Amn from S. enterica ser-ovar Typhimurium is 93 % identical with that of the E. coli enzyme with most of the sequence divergence in the 180-residue N-terminal domain . 
All of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium Amn mutations described above are clustered in the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain near residues ( K367 and T372 ) shown previously to bind Pi ( 58 ) .

a ( rbs ) , ribosome binding site . 
( Table 2 ) . 
The Apt enzyme catalyzes reaction of adenine with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to form AMP and pyrophosphate ( PP ) . 
This salvages free adenine and is likely to be driven by hydrolysis of PP . 
Two lines of evidence suggest that the apt mutations owe their DMB independence phenotype to loss of Apt activity . 
First , the apt-11 mutation is a G-A transition outside the apt coding region ( position 10 ) that removes one of the three matches to the ribosome binding ( Shine-Dal-garno ) consensus sequence and alters one of the two adjacent G residues shared by most such elements . 
This change is predicted to reduce apt expression . 
Second , a constructed inframe deletion mutation aptA18 : : Cmr ( sw ) caused the same growth phenotype as the several apt point mutations ( DMB-independent growth on ethanolamine ) . 
The apt mutations thus impair the adenine salvage pathway and are expected to cause an increase in the intracellular concentration of free adenine . 
Mutations that increase AMP nucleosidase activity ( Amn ) . 
Six of the 27 mutations allowing synthesis of pseudo-B12 co-enzymes were linked to a Tn10 insertion ( STM2008 ) , adjacent to the distal end of operon that encodes the B12 biosynthetic enzymes ( cob ) . 
Five mutations linked to this Tn10 insertion were sequenced ( Table 2 ) , and each had a base substitution inferred to cause an amino acid substitution in the Amn protein . 
This enzyme removes adenine from the ribose of AMP , leaving ribose-5 - PO4 ( 26 , 28 , 51 ) , and while considerable biochemical work has been done on the enzyme , no mutant phenotype has been reported , and no physiological role has been demonstrated . 
( amnA51 , amnA53 , and amnA55 ) are identical ( V366M ) and alter the amino acid adjacent to one of the Pi binding residues K367 . 
Mutation amnA54 alters a residue ( T355I ) in the same region . 
We predict that these amn mutations may interfere with Pi binding , thereby releasing the enzyme from feedback inhibition . 
Such activation of the enzyme would be expected to increase the level of free adenine and could account for the ability of these mutants to incorporate adenine into pseudo-B12 . 
The third mutation [ amnA52 ( S312N ) ] affects the AMP binding site , but it is not clear how this substitution might affect Amn function . 
A heritability test was done for mutation amnA52 ( G935A ) to demonstrate that it is responsible for the DMB-independent growth phenotype . 
A donor strain carrying amnA52 and the nearby Tn10 insertion ( TT25112 ) was crossed with a wild-type recipient selecting for growth on tetracycline . 
Of 40 transductants analyzed , 37 inherited the donor ability to grow without DMB and all of the 5 randomly chosen for sequencing acquired the donor amnA52 base change ( G935A ) . 
Conversely , the three rare recombinants whose growth remained dependent on DMB all showed the wild-type amn sequence . 
Model for how apt and amn mutations stimulate pseudo-B12 synthesis . 
Features of the model are listed below and diagrammed later ( see Fig. 7 ) . 
( i ) In the synthesis of pseudo-B12 cofactors , free adenine base is the precursor of the - axial ligand . 
( ii ) The apt mutations increase the pool of free adenine by impairing the adenine salvage pathway . 
( iii ) The amnA mutations increase the pool of free adenine by increasing the activity of Amn , a glycohydrolase that releases adenine from AMP . 
( iv ) Adenine base ( like DMB base ) is a substrate of the CobT enzyme , which catalyzes the exchange of DMB base with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD to form the DMB-adenine dinucleotide , - DAD ( 30 ) . 
By attaching the N-7 of adenine to C-1 of ribose , CobT forms adenine ( 7 ) - adenine dinucleotide 7 9 ( - Ade7-1R5-P-P-5R1-9Ade ) . 
The CobT product ( - A A D ) thus has one adenine attached at N-7 and the other at N-9 . 
( v ) Either of the two dinucleotides ( - DAD or - A7A9D ) can serve as a substrate for CobS , which is proposed to attach the entire dinucleotide to AdoCbiGDP by an attack of a free 3 OH of a dinucleotide ribose on the pyrophosphate bond of the activated corrin compound , Ado-Cbi-PP-R-guanine . 
This releases GMP from the corrin precursor and produces a corrinoid whose nucleotide loop ribose has three substitutions ( see Fig. 7 ) . 
( vi ) The CobC enzyme catalyzes hydrolytic release of an ADP moiety from the 5 position of ribose to leave the ﬁnal complete corrinoid . 
Evidence that free adenine stimulates pseudo-B12 synthesis . 
The model described above predicts that adenine is a substrate for CobT and the precursor of the - axial ligand of pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
Exogenous adenine was tested for its effect on the ability of S. enterica to use ethanolamine aerobically without added DMB . 
As seen in Fig. 6 , adenine was found to improve growth and substitute in part for added DMB . 
While stimulation was less than that seen for DMB , it increased with adenine concentration and required a functional CobT enzyme . 
It is not surprising that the stimulation by adenine is weak , since import of adenine is driven by internal formation of AMP ( by the Apt enzyme ) , so only slight increases in internal adenine are expected . 
Two mutations unlinked to amn require Amn activity for their phenotype . 
The constructed amn deletion mutation r amnA59 : : Kn ( sw ) was crossed into all 27 of the DMB-indepen-dent mutants . 
All six of the amn point mutants lost DMB independence when they received the deletion , as expected , since the gain-of-function amn point mutations would be removed . 
None of the 17 apt mutants lost DMB independence , demonstrating that other sources of free adenine are sufﬁcient to provide the growth phenotype when the salvage pathway is blocked . 
Except for the two mutations described below , all other DMB-independent mutants maintained their DMB-in-dependent growth phenotype after introduction of an amn deletion . 
Two additional mutations ( amnX61 and amnX62 ) have not been mapped but are not linked to the amn , apt , or guaAB loci ( see below ) . 
Both of these mutants lost their DMB-indepen-dent growth phenotype when the amn deletion mutation was introduced . 
This suggests that the mode of action of these mutations involves increasing the activity of Amn . 
Tests of Amn regulation . 
To test the possibility that amn is transcriptionally controlled , an operon fusion was constructed that places a lacZ gene under transcriptional control of the amn promoter . 
Evidence that expression of lacZ was actually under control of the amn promoter was the ﬁnding that deletion of the amn promoter essentially eliminated transcription of the amn-lac fusion . 
Under all conditions tested , amn was constitutively transcribed at a low level , producing about 40 Miller units of - galactosidase regardless of the carbon source or the presence of vitamin B12 , DMB , or Cbi . 
This contrasts with evidence in E. coli that amn transcription increased in response to added cyclic AMP ( 26 ) . 
Since in vitro studies showed that AMP nucleosidase of E. coli is subject to feedback inhibition by phosphate , the concentration of phosphate in the medium was varied from 73 mM ( E medium ) to 1.3 mM ( morpholinepro-panesulfonic acid [ MOPS ] medium ) ( 34 ) but had no effect on the DMB requirement for growth on ethanolamine . 
A mutation that maps near ppk and guaAB stimulates pseudo-B12 synthesis independent of Amn . 
One of the DMB independent mutants ( dmb-1 ) was 85 % linked to a Tn10 insertion in the STM2503 gene located close to the guanine biosynthetic genes guaA and guaB . 
The mutation has not yet been identiﬁed . 
Synthesis of pseudo-B12 ( like that of B12 ) requires CobT , CobS , CobU , and CobU . 
CobT is required for synthesis of both B12 cofactors ( Fig. 2 ) and for the production of pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
The role of CobT in B12 production has previously been demonstrated ( 30 , 56 ) . 
The role of CobT in pseudo-B12 production was shown by moving a cobT mutation ( TT24729 ) into all of the 27 mutants shown in Table 2 , all of which grow without DMB because they synthesize Ado-pseudo-B12 . 
In all mutants , the DMB-independent growth phenotype ( ability to make pseudo-B12 cofactors ) was lost after the addition of the cobT mutation ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The role of CobT in adding DMB to form B12 cofactors was conﬁrmed by showing that these same mutants failed to make active corrinoid cofactors even when DMB was added . 
By similar genetic tests , it was shown that the CobU , CobS , and CobC proteins are required to make pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
In-frame deletions of cobU and cobS were constructed and moved into strains with the deletion mutation apt-18 , which causes strains to synthesize only pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
The added cob deletions allow normal expression of genes located distal to the promoter in the cob operon . 
For testing the requirement for CobC , a single cobC : : Tn10 insertion mutation was transduced into a strain carrying the apt-18 : : Cmr deletion ; polarity is not an issue , since cobC is a single gene outside the operon ( 37 ) . 
The cobU , cobS , and cobC mutations all eliminated the ability of the apt-18 deletion mutant to grow on Cbi ; since the mutant normally made pseudo-B12 ( see above ) , the added deletions are concluded to block incorporation of adenine . 
As expected , these double mutants failed to make active corrinoid cofactors even if DMB was provided . 
This conﬁrms the previous ﬁnding that CobU , CobS , and CobC are needed for cobalamin production ( 31 , 36 ) . 
It should be noted that the cobC mutation blocked pseudo-B12 production , while the same mutation caused only a partial block in synthesis of corrinoids in the presence of DMB . 
We conclude that the CobT , CobU , CobS , and CobC enzymes are all required for synthesis of both Ado-Cbl ( ligand DMB ) and Ado-pseudo-B12 ( ligand adenine ) . 
The leakiness of the block in the presence of DMB may result from accumulation of the ﬁnal intermediate when excess DMB was provided , allowing some other enzyme to replace CobC in the last reaction ( see Discussion ) . 
Since adenine availability seems to limit growth in the absence of DMB ( see section on precursor accumulation above ) , lower accumulation of the penultimate intermediate is expected . 
Wild-type cells produce Ado-pseudo-B12 during aerobic growth on propanediol . 
The above evidence for synthesis of pseudo-B12 cofactor and its dependence on the CobT , CobU , CobS , and CobC proteins was based on a set of DMB-inde-pendent mutants . 
It seemed important to determine whether this conclusion is true for wild-type S. enterica as well . 
Several earlier reports suggested the possibility that wildtype S. enterica can make corrinoids other than B12 . 
It was reported that wild-type S. enterica synthesizes pseudo-B12 during growth under strictly anaerobic conditions and standard B12 under microaerobic conditions ( 21 , 22 ) . 
Nutritional experiments suggested that wild-type S. enterica uses a ligand other than DMB during growth on propanediol . 
While DMB was required for aerobic growth on ethanolamine ( Cbi ) , no DMB was required for growth on propanediol under the same conditions ( 38 ) . 
Corrinoids were extracted from wild-type S. enterica cells grown aerobically on propanediol ( plus Cbi ) and examined by HPLC/MS . 
The corrinoid extracted from these cells was CN-pseudo-B12 ( data not shown ) . 
The ability of wild-type S. enterica to make corrinoids and grow on propanediol under these conditions was blocked by a cobT mutation . 
These results provide additional evidence that wild-type cells can make pseudo-B12 cofactors and do so using the same pathway as the mutants described above . 
In addition , providing DMB to these wildtype cell cultures caused a shift from pseudo-B12 to B12 cofactor production . 
The question of why DMB is required for aerobic growth on ethanolamine but not on propanediol is addressed below . 
Pseudo-B12 ( or derived forms ) can serve as cofactor for MetH and EutBC and PduCDE enzymes . 
Three known enzymes of S. enterica depend on corrinoid cofactors ( MetH , EutBC , and PduCDE ) . 
The synthesis of two different cofactors raises the question of whether all three enzymes can use both pseudo-B12 and pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
Use of pseudo-B12 by propanediol dehydratase ( PduCDE ) is implicit in the ﬁnding that only pseudo-B12 cofactors were found during growth on propanediol ( above ) . 
The other enzymes were tested with CobT mutant cells that can not assemble a corrinoid internally . 
Pseudo-B12 was provided as CN-pseudo-B12 . 
For this added corrinoid to provide a cofactor for ethanolamine ammonia lyase ( EutABC ) or methonine synthetase ( MetH ) , the vitamin must be transported and used without the loss of its - ligand adenine base , and it must accept a - ligand adenosyl group . 
Since CN-pseudo-B12 is a precious commodity , these tests were done by qualitative spot tests on agar plates . 
Cells of a cobT mutant ( TT25575 ) can grow aerobically on ethanolamine as the sole carbon and energy source only when a `` complete '' corrinoid with an - axial ligand ( e.g. , CN-Cbl ) is provided . 
These cells can not synthesize the corrin ring aerobically and ( because of their CobT defect ) can not add a new - axial ligand to any provided complete corrinoid . 
Therefore , they can not use Cbi as a source of corrinoids . 
When provided with CN-pseudo-B12 ( 16 ) , this strain grew using ethanolamine as the sole carbon source . 
Pseudo-B12 must therefore serve as an alternative to cobalamin and allow activity of ethanolamine ammonia lyase . 
This growth is known to require a corrinoid with a - axial adenosine ligand , suggesting that S. enterica can transport CN-pseudo-B12 and replace its - axial CN group with adenosine , using one if its adenosyl transferases , CobA or EutT ( 11 , 50 ) . 
Similarly , cells with both a metE mutation and a cobT mutation ( TT25721 ) were tested for their ability to produce methionine and grow on minimal medium containing glucose using their corrinoid-dependent MetH enzyme . 
This strain grows if either methionine or B12 is provided . 
Cbi is not suf-ﬁcient because the CobT defect prevents the addition of an - axial ligand , even when DMB is given . 
However , exogenous CN-pseudo-B12 allowed strain TT25721 to grow on minimal medium containing glucose but not methionine and thus must serve as precursor for a methyl ( ) - corrinoid cofactor used by the MetH enzyme . 
These results demonstrate that the Cob enzyme of S. enterica can transfer an adenosyl group to CN-pseudo-B12 and that the MetH enzyme can replace the - axial ligand of Ado-pseudo-B12 with a methyl group to form the methyl-corrinoid used by MetH ( 32 ) . 
FIG. 6 . 
Effect of adenine base on the ability to use ethanolamine . 
Wild-type cells were tested for the ability to grow aerobically on minimal NCE medium with ethanolamine as the sole carbon source and the indicated supplementation by adenine . 
Culture OD600 was monitored using a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader and KC4 software and is presented on a logarithmic scale . 
DISCUSSION
Evidence that Salmonella enterica synthesizes pseudo-B12 coenzymes from provided Cbi using the same enzymes ( CobT , CobU , CobS , and CobC ) known to be required for production of vitamin B12 cofactors is presented . 
The remarkable feature of the pathway to pseudo-B12 is that it appears to use free adenine base as the precursor but does so only when no DMB is available . 
Use of free adenine in the CobT-catalyzed exchange with nicotinamide of NAD may serve as the means of forming the unusual adenine ( N-7 ) - ribose ( C-1 ) linkage that characterizes pseudo-B12 coenzymes ( 16 ) . 
Pseudo-B12 cofactors can be used by all the corrinoid-dependent enzymes of S. enterica and may be the only corrinoid types made under periods of high demand unless DMB is provided exogenously . 
We suggest that pseudo-B12 is the main cofactor used by S. enterica , which makes very little DMB but uses it ( when provided ) in preference to adenine . 
Control of - ligand synthesis . 
The results presented raise the question , `` Why does the ability to assemble complete corrinoids from provided ( CN ) 2Cbi change with the growth conditions ? '' 
Only aerobic conditions are discussed , since oxygen is required for synthesis of DMB ( 15 , 29 , 54 ) ; under these conditions , corrin ring must be provided ( as CN2Cbi ) . 
( i ) When ethanolamine is the sole carbon source , no complete corrinoids are made unless DMB is provided in addition to Cbi . 
Selection of the mutants described here depended on this phenomenon . 
( ii ) With glucose as the carbon source , about 100 molecules of B12 cofactors ( with DMB ) are made per cell , presumably using the small amount of DMB synthesized endogenously ( 2 , 20 ) . 
( iii ) When propanediol is the carbon source , pseudo-B12 cofactors are made . 
We suggest a model that explains this behavior using the data described here in combination with previously published results from other labs . 
The background for this model is discussed below . 
Transcription of the divergent operons ( cob and pdu ) for cobalamin synthesis and propanediol catabolism is induced by propanediol , but not by ethanolamine ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 43 ) , and the cob operon is repressed by Ado-Cbl ( 33 , 40 , 41 , 57 ) . 
Whenever cells induce their ethanolamine or propanediol enzymes , about 10,000 molecules of corrinoids per cell are made ; this occurs because the relevant B12-dependent degradative enzymes bind B12 , creating a demand for corrinoids that releases cob from repression . 
This in turn creates a demand for lower ligand bases DMB or adenine . 
Variation of corrinoid assembly in response to carbon sources . 
The variation of corrinoid assembly in response to carbon sources can be explained in terms of the above background information . 
( i ) Growth on ethanolamine plus Cbi . 
On ethanolamine plus Cbi , the eut operon and ethanolamine ammonia lyase are induced ( creating demand ) , but the cob and pdu operons are tightly repressed . 
Induction of eut requires ethanolamine plus a corrinoid , and even the incomplete corrinoid Ado-Cbi can be used ( A. Britten and P. J. Anderson , unpublished ) ; cob is repressed by B12 , and perhaps also by Cbi . 
We suggest that DMB can be made only in very small amounts and that some enzyme encoded in the cob or pdu operons contributes to production of free adenine . 
This proposal would explain why there is insufﬁcient lower ligand base to produce the corrinoids needed for ethanolamine metabolism when cob and pdu operons are off ( on ethanolamine ) -- little free adenine is made , and corrinoid demand exceeds the minimal supply of DMB . 
Therefore , aerobic growth on ethanolamine requires added DMB or enhanced adenine production ( by the mutations described here ) . 
( ii ) Aerobic growth on glucose plus Cbi . 
During aerobic growth on glucose plus Cbi , neither major degradative pathway is induced , and corrinoid demand is low . 
In this situation , extremely low levels of corrinoid are made , and the tiny amount of available DMB is sufﬁcient . 
That is , very little complete corrinoid is made , and all of it is B12 . 
( iii ) Growth on propanediol . 
During growth on propanediol , the cob and pdu operons are induced . 
There is high demand for corrinoid , and free adenine can be generated by some enzyme encoded within these operons . 
Endogenous DMB may be present in small amounts but in amounts insufﬁcient to contribute heavily or to inhibit adenine production . 
This explains the synthesis of pseudo-B12 cofactors during growth on propanediol . 
The mutants described here increased the level of free ad-enine and allowed synthesis of considerable corrinoid without induction of the cob and pdu operons . 
The addition of exogenous DMB to the mutants or to wild-type cells growing on propanediol ( with high levels of the CobS , CobT , and CobC enzymes ) causes a shift from pseudo-B12 to cobalamins , suggesting that DMB is used preferentially , at least at the high concentrations provided here . 
New view of the CobT , CobS , and CobC reactions . 
There are several uncertainties about this pathway . 
We have assumed ( Fig. 2 ) that NAD is the CobT substrate that accepts the ligand base ( adenine or DMB ) in exchange for nicotinamide and that the product of this reaction ( - A7A9D or - DAD ) donates the ligand nucleoside to the activated corrin precursor ( Ado-Cbi-GDP ) by reactions catalyzed by CobS and CobC . 
However , it was initially suggested that the CobT substrate is the NAD biosynthetic precursor nicotinate mononucleotide ( NaMN ) , which has substantially more favorable Km and Kcat than those of NAD ( 12 , 13 , 56 ) . 
If NaMN is the relevant substrate , then the CobT product is a simple nucleotide and all that is required is to remove the phosphate and attach the nucleoside to the activated corrin ( using CobS and CobC in either order ) . 
Despite its unfavorable kinetic parameters , NAD seemed more relevant because of its higher intracellular concentration and the ability of the NAD exchange product to donate DMB nucleoside in the formation of B12 ( 30 ) . 
It was therefore proposed ( 30 ) that NAD is the substrate and the CobT product is a dinucleotide whose pyrophosphate must be split before one half is attached to the activated corrin . 
The process is then completed by removal of phosphate . 
This pyrophosphatase required by the pathway was not revealed by the genetic approaches . 
We suggest an alternative pathway ( Fig. 7 ) that accounts for all known mutants and allows either NaMN or NAD to be the substrate of CobT . 
In this pathway , when NAD is used , th entire CobT product ( - A7A9D or - DAD ) is attached directly to the corrinoid precursor by the CobS enzyme . 
The pyrophosphate of Ado-Cbi-GDP activates the corrin precursor and is attacked by the free 3 OH of ribose from - DAD or - A7A9D , releasing GMP from the corrin precursor . 
This generates a corrinoid intermediate whose ribose has three substitutions . 
Its position 3 is linked by a phosphodiester to the aminopropanol side chain of the corrin . 
Its C-1 carbon is attached to the base ( Ade7 or DMB ) that will be the - axial ligand of the complete corrinoid . 
Its C-5 position remains attached to ADP ( the rest of the incoming - DAD or - A7A9D dinucleotide ) . 
The ﬁnal step is removal of this ADP by CobC to produce the ﬁnished cofactor . 
Whenever CobT uses NaMN as substrate , the produced mononucleotide ( DMB-R-P or A7-R-P ) is transferred by CobS to the activated corrin , and CobC removes the phosphate . 
Sources of DMB in S. enterica . 
While genes for synthesis of DMB have been discovered in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhodospirillum rubrum ( 4 , 15 , 54 ) , none has been identiﬁed among the many B12-deﬁcient mutants isolated in S. enterica ( 10 , 18 , 19 , 45 ) . 
Two redundant factors may have conspired to allow such mutants to escape detection . 
DMB appears to be a minor contaminant in standard agar , and extremely little ( about 100 molecules per cell ) is sufﬁcient for production of methionine by MetH , the genetic assay used to identify cobalamin mutants . 
Puriﬁed ( Noble ) agar was used here to show that ethanolamine synthesis required the addition of DMB , since on standard agar , cells showed some growth on ethanolamine without added DMB . 
The compound contaminating agar is not a complete corrinoid , since Cbi is needed under all aerobic conditions tested . 
In the purest mineral salts medium ( without agar ) , wild-type S. enterica ( grown aerobically with Cbi ) makes B12 ( 20 ) but makes only about 100 molecules per cell ( 2 ) , an amount sufﬁcient for methionine synthesis . 
It seems likely that this minimal level of DMB synthesized by S. enterica could be made either enzymatically or chemically by the `` facile oxidative cascade '' suggested by Maggio-Hall et al. ( 29 ) . 
The amount of DMB contaminating agar is likely to be sufﬁcient to allow methi-onine production in mutants totally unable to make DMB . 
The bluB gene , shown to synthesize DMB in other bacteria , has homologues in S. enterica genes ( ydjA , mdaA , and nfnB ) with 25 % sequence identity and 41 % similarity and similar molecular weight . 
Deletions mutants for each individual gene and one double mutant ( mdaA nfnB ) were constructed and found unimpaired in their ability to grow using corrinoid-de-pendent MetH to supply their methionine requirement ( aerobically with Cbi but no added DMB ) . 
However , this ﬁnding can not be securely interpreted , because one might expect cell to form pseudo-B12 if their pathway to DMB synthesis is blocked . 
Our results suggest that S. enterica makes pseudo-B12 cofactors whenever corrinoid demand exceeds the minimal supply of DMB . 
That is , adenine may be installed whenever the DMB level is too low . 
Thus , mutations that prevent DMB synthesis are not expected to block corrinoid production but rather to cause a shift to pseudo-B12 synthesis and cause no growth defect . 
Since S. enterica corrinoid-dependent enzymes can use both forms , it will be difﬁcult to genetically identify or characterize mutations in the DMB pathway unless a way can be found to block production or insertion of adenine as an - axial ligand . 
Normal source of free adenine for synthesis of pseudo-B12 coenzymes . 
While adenine levels are increased in the mutants described here , we do not know the source of adenine when wild-type cells make pseudo-B12 cofactors . 
Deletion of the amn gene did not prevent pseudo-B production , making it 12 clear that this is not an essential source ; however , the position of the amn gene adjacent to the cob operon ( 4.5 kb from CobT ) still makes it an attractive candidate for contributing to adenine production in view of the frequent clustering of genes contributing to a single function ( 24 , 25 , 35 ) . 
An interesting possibility is that CobT has a secondary activity of removing adenine from some adenine nucleotide and this activity is inhibited by DMB . 
Genetic evidence supports the idea that CobT has a second activity that contributes to synthesis of the lower ligand base ( 7 ) . 
Such a second activity might resolve the curious situation that CobT has a 100-fold-lower K and a m 100-fold-higher Kcat for the NAD precursor NaMN than those for NAD , strongly suggesting that NaMN is the relevant acceptor of the lower nucleotide base ( 12 , 13 ) . 
The vastly higher intracellular concentration of NAD led to the conclusion that NAD might be a major contributor ( 30 ) . 
If CobT has a second activity and produces adenine , its kinetic parameters might be very different when measured in the presence of the adenine donor molecule . 
FIG. 7 . 
Proposed pathway for completion of Ado-pseudo-B12 and Ado-Cbl . 
In this pathway , the reaction at the left forming AdoCbi-P-P-5R1-Gua is well established . 
The lower ligand base ( adenine or DMB ) is exchanged for the nicotinamide ( Nm ) moiety of NAD to form the donor dinucleotide ( either -7 AAD or - DAD ) . 
It is proposed that CobS catalyzes an attack on the pyrophosphate of the activated corrin precursor by the 3 OH of the ribose nearest the critical base ( adenine or DMB ) of the dinucleotide . 
This forms the proposed penultimate intermediate whose ribose has substitutions at positions 1 , 3 , and 5 . 
Removal of AMP ( remainder of the donor dinucleotide ) from the 5 position leaves the complete corrinoid .
