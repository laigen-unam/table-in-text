Abstract 
Transcriptional analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) in the presence of the mammalian hormone norepinephrine revealed up-regulation of genes in the ﬂagellar and chemotaxis regulon . 
Motility assays conﬁrmed enhanced motility of wild-type S. Typhimurium in the presence of norepinephrine that could be blocked by the a-adrenergic antagonist , phentolamine . 
Furthermore , a mutation in the qseC gene , encoding the sensor kinase of the two-component QseBC quorum-sensing system , also diminished motility of S. Typhimurium . 
To investigate the role of S. Typhimurium QseC in vivo , 13-week old pigs were intranasally inoculated with equal concentrations ( 1 10 CFU ) of wild-type S. Typhimurium and a qseC mutant . 
Over a 1-week competitive index 9 experiment , the qseC mutant displayed decreased colonization of the gastrointestinal tract compared to the wild-type parent strain . 
Thus , this study has identiﬁed a role for the QseBC quorum-sensing signal transduction system in motility and swine colonization of S. Typhimurium . 
Cross-talk between cell -- cell communication systems in Salmonella ( quorum sensing ) and host hormones may explain opportunistic behaviors of the pathogen , such as immune evasion and stress-induced recrudescence of Salmonella , during ﬂuctuations of host hormone levels .

species , the greater is the accumulation of the quorumsensing signal in the environment . 
Accumulation of the quorum-sensing signal permits the bacterial cells to respond to the AI as a population instead of individual cells . 
Typically , the response to an AI involves the modulation of gene expression . 
Multiple quorum-sensing systems , including the luxS / AI-2 and AI-3 systems , are produced by Escherichia coli ( both commensal and pathogenic ) , Shigella sp. , Salmonella sp. , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae , as well as microbial intestinal ﬂora cultured from stools of healthy human volunteers [ 4,5 ] . 
It has been proposed that intestinal bacteria may utilize AI-2 and AI-3 for interspecies communication and may aid patho-genic bacteria by signaling the appropriate timing for expression of virulence determinants within the gastro-intestinal tract [ 6 ]

Introduction 
The endocrine system in higher eukaryotes uses hormones as messengers for cellular communication within the body [ 1 ] . 
Therefore , distant cells can work in concert to respond to chemical signals and alter physiology . 
In an analogous manner , bacteria are able to communicate via cell-to-cell communication systems termed quorum sensing [ 2,3 ] . 
Quorum sensing utilizes small hormone-like mole-cules called autoinducers ( AIs ) to monitor the environment . 
As bacteria produce and release AIs , the signal molecules accumulate in the environment . 
Thus , the greater the cell density of a quorum-sensing bacterial

Similar to AI-2 and AI-3 being produced by bacterial cells , epinephrine and norepinephrine are produced by the mammalian host for cellular communication . 
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters released by the sympathetic nervous system . 
The gastrointestinal tract is highly innervated with the sympathetic nervous system controlling motility , secretion and vasoregulation [ 7 -- 9 ] . 
Kaper and Sperandio [ 10 ] suggest that communication between bacteria and the host occurs through the quorumsensing ( bacteria ) and neuroendocrine ( host ) systems . 
Thus , the presence of epinephrine/norepinephrine in the gastrointestinal tract , in addition to AI-3 ( produced by the microbial ﬂora ) , may serve as quorum-sensing signals to E. coli and Salmonella , alerting the pathogens of their preferred sites of colonization and invasion . 
In E. coli , the QseBC two-component system modulates the quorum-sensing response to AI-3 , epinephrine and norepinephrine [ 11 ] . 
QseC is a histidine sensor kinase and QseB is a response regulator that modulates motility in the presence of these quorum-sensing signals . 
In this study , the transcriptional induction of a large number of ﬂagellar and chemotaxis genes in response to norepinephrine exposure prompted an investigation of the role of the QseC sensor kinase in motility and swine colonization of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial growth media
The S. Typhimurium strains used in this study were grown in the following media : Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth , Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) ( 31053 , Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) or SAPI minimal medium containing 2.77 mM dextrose , 6.25 mM ammonium nitrate , 1.84 mM monobasic potassium phosphate , 3.35 mM potassium chloride , and 1.01 mM magnesium sulfate , 30 % porcine serum and 10 mM Hepes buffer [ 12,13 ] . 
Norepinephrine was used at concentrations of 50 mM and 2 mM . 
Norepinephrine is photosensitive , readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen and its half-life is very short . 
Initial experiments ( microarray and real-time RT-PCR ) utilized a higher concentration of norepinephr-ine due to overlap with other research projects in the laboratory . 
However , the motility assays were performed with a lower concentration of norepinephrine for comparison of quorum-sensing phenotypes to other microorganisms that have been previously published by other investigators . 
Phentolamine was used at a concentration of 200 mM . 
Antibiotics were used at the concentrations of 100 mg/ml for ampicillin , 30 mg/ml for nalidixic acid , and 30 mg/ml for chloramphenicol . 
Unless otherwise indicated , all chemicals were purchased from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) . 
Cultures were grown and assays performed at 37 1C . 
Preconditioned DMEM ( i.e. spent medium ) was produced by growing a culture of BSX 8 for approximately 24 h . 
The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 1C and the pre-conditioned DMEM supernatant was ﬁlter sterilized through a 0.2 mm ﬁlter . 
2.2. Construction of the qseC mutant by recombineering
Recombineering was performed to construct a strain containing the qseC knockout by transformation of a linear PCR product containing the cat gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase . 
The oBBI 88 ( 50 CGATAGCT ¬ GAATGAGTGACGTGCTGAAGTTCCTATACTTTC ¬ TAGAGAATAGGAACTTCACGTAAGAGGTTCCAA-CTTTCAC ) and oBBI 89 primer ( 50 GCATAGAGCAGT ¬ GACGTAGTCGCGAAGTTCCTATTCTCTAGAAAG ¬ TATAGGAACTTCATTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCACTC ) pair containing FRT sites ( underlined ) were used to amplify the cat gene from pACYC184 ( GenBank accession no . 
X06403 ) . 
The 50 end of both oBBI 88 and 89 have stop codons in all three reading frames to truncate protein translation . 
A puriﬁed oBBI 88/89 cat PCR product was used as a PCR template to amplify the qseC knockout fragment using primers oBBI 96 ( 50 CGTGCACGG-CATCGGCTACACCCTGGGTGACGCATGAAATTGAC - GATAGCTGAATGAGTGACGTGC ) and oBBI 97 ( 50 CTCTGTTACCAACTTACTACGGCCTCAAATCCACC-TTCCGCGGCATAGAGCAGTGACGTAGTCGC ) . 
Pri-mers oBBI 96 ( upstream ) and 97 ( downstream ) contain 45 and 44 bp of qseC ( STM3178 ) nucleotide sequence , respectively ( bold ) . 
Following PCR puriﬁcation of oBBI 96/97 cat , the fragment was transformed into arabinose-in-duced BSX 7 ( TT22971 ( LT2 ) containing pKD46 ) [ 14 ] . 
Transformants were plated to LB chloramphenicol to select for a qseC knockout strain . 
The qseC : : cat construct was moved to BSX 8 ( w4232 ) [ 15 ] by P22 phage transduction , and the resulting qseC mutant was named BBS 10 . 
The gene knockout was conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the qseC region . 
2.3. Motility assay
Strains were grown overnight in DMEM containing 10 mM FeCl3 at 37 1C , 180 rpm . 
Strains were diluted 1:50 in DMEM and incubated at 37 1C , 180 rpm . 
At 7 h , bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in an equal volume of DMEM . 
A 1 ml aliquot of bacteria was spotted onto DMEM 0.3 % motility medium containing 10 mM FeCl3 and incubated at 37 1C for 16 -- 18 h. Where indicated , the concentrations of norepinephrine and phentolamine used in the motility medium were 50 and 200 mM , respectively . 
2.4 . 
RNA extraction and analysis by DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR assays 
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi kit and RNase-free DNase set ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) from S. Typhimurium BSX 8 and BBS 10 grown to mid-log phase ( OD600 1/4 0.4 ) in SAPI serum medium containing 0 or 2 mM norepinephrine and frozen in RNAprotect Bacteri 
Reagent ( Qiagen ) . 
Following RNA extraction from triplicate experiments , a second DNase I digestion was performed using the Turbo DNase-free kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) . 
RNA integrity , quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 and RNA Nano 6000 Labchip kit ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) . 
For DNA microarray analysis , RNA was labeled with aminoallyl dUTP via ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis followed by aminoallyl coupling to either Alexa 555 or 647 ﬂuorescent molecules ( Invitrogen ) according to Protocol M007 from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center at The Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR ; http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols.shtml ) . 
Labeled cDNA was hybridized to Salmonella typhimurium/typhi DNA micro-arrays ( version 2 ) developed and manufactured by TIGR ( http://pfgrc.tigr.org/desc.shtml ) using Protocol M008 ( http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols.shtml ) . 
The ScanArray Express ( Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences , Boston , MA ) was used to scan the microarray slides and signal intensities were quantiﬁed using ScanArray Express 3.0 software . 
Back-ground-corrected data were normalized using the Lowess function on a minimum of three biological replicates . 
Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit ( Qiagen ) and the Chromo4 Real-Time PCR Detection System ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . 
Primer sequences are given in Table 1 . 
RTPCR transcripts were ampliﬁed in duplicate from triplicate experiments with the following thermal cycling parameters : 50 1C for 30 min , 95 1C for 15 min , 35 cycles at 94 1C for 15 s , 60 1C for 60 s . 
At the 60 1C step , ﬂuorescent data acquisition was performed . 
Following PCR cycling , disassociation curve analysis was performed from 55 to 90 1C with a plate reading at every 2 1C and a hold for 5 s at each temperature increment . 
Relative quantiﬁcation of gene ampliﬁcation by real-time RT-PCR was evaluated using the comparative CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen [ 16 ] . 
The gyrase subunit B gene , gyrB , was used as the endogenous normalization control . 
The DCT values were calculated by determining the difference in threshold values for target and reference in each sample . 
Calculation of DDCT involved the subtraction of no norepinephrine DCT value from DCT value of the 2 mM norepinephrine . 
Fold differences in gene expression of the target gene are presented as 2 . 
Statistical analyses of DDCT the DCT values were analyzed by SAS Analyst ( Cary , NC ) using the two-sample t-test for the means . 
Results were considered signiﬁcant when Po0 .05 . 
IPEC J2 cells ( passages 52 -- 57 ) were derived from porcine jejunal epithelial cells and were a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Schultz ( Department of Anatomy and Physiology , Kansas State University , Manhattan , KS ) . 
The cells were grown and maintained in 50 % DMEM and 50 % Nutrient Mixture F12 ( 1:1 DMEM/F12 ; Invitrogen Life Technologies ) , 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 5 mg/ml insulin , 5 mg/ml transferrin , 5 ng/ml selenous acid , 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor , 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin . 
The cells were seeded into 24-well cell culture plates ( BD Falcon , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and maintained in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 1C for 2 days . 
The day of the experiment , cells were washed thrice with PBS and one well of cells was used to determine cell density ( 3 10 cells/well ) using Trypan Blue staining 4 and a hemocytometer . 
BSX 8 and BBS 10 were grown stationary in DMEM / F12 medium devoid of antibiotics at 37 1C for 18 h. Bacterial populations were estimated by spectrophoto-metry at 600 nm optical density and enumerated following serial dilution plating of each strain . 
Bacteria were incubated with PBS-washed IPEC J2 cells ( MOI 1/4 200 ) in a ﬁnal volume of 200 ml DMEM/F12 medium devoid of antibiotics for 2 h at 37 1C , 5 % CO2 . 
To remove extracellular bacteria , cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated in medium containing 50 mg/ml of gentami-cin for 2 h. To enumerate intracellular Salmonella , the cells were washed twice with PBS , and 100 ml of 1 % Triton X-100 was added to each well for 15 min of incubation at 37 1C . 
Serial dilution plating was performed on each sample and plated on LB agar plates for overnight growth at 37 1C . 
The percent of bacteria that invaded the IPEC J2 cells was determined by dividing the number of intracellular bacteria by the number of bacteria in the inoculum and multiplying by 100 . 
Statistical analysis was performed by SAS Analyst on four experiments each with three replicates using the two-sample t-test for the means . 
Results were considered signiﬁcant when Po0 .05 .

2.6. Competitive index (CI) animal experiment
Six conventionally raised male and female piglets from Salmonella spp . 
fecal-negative sows were weaned at 12 days of age , shipped to the National Animal Disease Center , Ames , IA , and raised in two groups of three in an isolation facility . 
Pigs were randomly assigned groups such that each group of three pigs was represented by a single offspring from three different sows . 
Bacteriologic culture of rectal swabs was performed multiple times to conﬁrm that all pigs were negative for Salmonella spp . 
At 13 weeks of age ( day 0 ) , all six pigs received an intranasal inoculation of 1 ml PBS containing two S. Typhimurium strains , BSX 8 ( 1.2 10 CFU ( colony-forming units ) ) and BBS 10 ( 1.3 9 10 CFU ) . 
Rectal temperatures and clinical symptoms 9 ( lethargy , loss of appetite and diarrhea ) were recorded for each animal daily . 
Pig fecal samples were obtained on days 1 -- 7 and 14 for quantitative and qualitative Salmonella culture analysis . 
The qseC mutant strain was differentiated from the wild-type ( WT ) strain based upon chloramphenicol resistance . 
On days 7 and 14 , pigs ( n 1/4 3 ) were necropsied and six tissue samples ( cecum , ileal Peyer 's Patch , ileocecal lymph nodes , tonsil , liver , and spleen ) were placed on ice for quantitative and qualitative Salmonella culture . 
For calculation of the CI , the output ratio ( qseC CFU/WT CFU ) was divided by the input ratio ( 1.0833 ) of the mutant to the wildtype strain . 
To incorporate samples that only had qualitative data ( samples that had too few Salmonella for quantitative detection ) into the calculations for CI and P-value , the highest possible value was given for the level of detection . 
For example , the lowest possible value for quantitative detection was 50 CFU/g of feces and 20 CFU/g of tissue . 
Therefore , samples negative in the quantitative analysis but positive in the qualitative testing are represented by a `` + '' and were given the highest possible value for a quantitative negative/qualitative positive sample ( 50 CFU for fecal or 20 CFU for tissues ) to determine CI and P-values . 
The level of detection for the qualitative assay was 1 CFU/g ; therefore , quantitative negative/qualitative negative samples are represented by a `` '' and were given the highest possible value of 1 CFU/g to determine CI and P-values . 
For statistical analysis , the CI data ( output/input ratio ) was analyzed by SAS Analyst using the one-sample t-test for a mean . 
Most of the samples at 14 day post-inoculation were only qualitatively positive ; thus , only the data for Salmonella colonization of the tonsils at day 14 is presented , since CI and P-values could not be calculated for the other tissues . 
All liver and spleen tissue samples were negative for Salmonella . 
Procedures involving animals were lawful and approved by the USDA , ARS , NADC Animal Care and Use Committee . 
2.7 . 
Quantitative and qualitative Salmonella culture analysis 
For quantitative bacteriology , 1 g of pig feces was combined with 5 ml PBS , vortexed and 100 ml directly plated to brilliant green agar with sulfadiazine ( BGS ; Difco , Detroit , MI ) containing nalidixic acid , ferric ammonium citrate ( 0.8 g/l ) , and sodium thiosulfate ( 6.8 g/l ) with and without chloramphenicol . 
For tissue samples , 1 g of each tissue was combined with 2 ml of PBS in a whirlpak bag , pounded with a mallet , and homogenized in a Stomacher ( Seward , Westbury , NY ) for 1 min . 
One hundred microliters of the resulting solution was aliquoted onto BGS containing nalidixic acid , ferric ammonium citrate , and sodium thiosulfate with and without chloramphenicol . 
One hundred microliters of a 10-fold dilution of each fecal and tissue sample were also plated , and additional dilutions were performed when colonyforming units reached 4300/plate . 
Following 24 h of incubation at 37 1C , black colonies were enumerated and a single colony from each plate was conﬁrmed to be Salmonella by serogroup antiserum agglutination ( Beckton , Dickinson and Co. , Sparks , MD ) . 
The total number of CFU for each quantitative tissue or fecal sample was calculated per gram of sample by obtaining the number of Salmonella per plate and multiplying by the dilution factor . 
Qualitative bacteriology of Salmonella was performed as follows : 1 g ( fecal ) or 100 ml ( homogenized tissue ) samples were inoculated in 10 ml of GN-Hajna ( GN ; Difco ) broth and tetrathionate ( TET ; VWR , Rutherford , NJ ) broth for 24 and 48 h of growth at 37 1C , respectively . 
Following incubation , 100 ml of each culture was transferred to 10 ml Rappaport -- Vassiliadis medium ( RV ; Difco ) and incubated at 37 1C for 18 h . 
The cultures were streaked on BGS containing nalidixic acid , ferric ammonium citrate , and sodium thiosulfate with and without chloramphenicol . 
Colonies suspicious for Salmonella were conﬁrmed by serogroup antiserum agglutination . 
3. Results

S. Typhimurium motility genes are up-regulated during exposure to norephinephrine 
To investigate the transcriptional response of S. Typhi-murium to norepinephrine exposure , DNA microarray analysis was performed using total RNA isolated fro 
S. Typhimurium grown in SAPI serum medium with and without 2 mM norepinephrine . 
A number of Salmonella genes in the ﬂagellar and chemotaxis regulon were upregulated in the norepinephrine-exposed Salmonella culture ( data not shown ) . 
Since ﬂagellar assembly is dictated by a hierarchy of ﬂagellar gene transcription [ 17 ] , real-time RTPCR was employed to measure the gene expression of early , middle , and late genes of the ﬂagellar assembly cascade during exposure to norepinephrine ( Table 1 ) . 
Similar to the microarray data , real-time RT-PCR revealed up-regulation of the ﬂiA and ﬂiY ( middle genes ) as well as ﬂjB ( late gene ) . 
The `` early '' ﬂhC gene of the master ﬂagellar ﬂhDC operon was also transcriptionally activated .

Enhanced motility of Salmonella during norepinephrine exposure

A mutation in the qseC gene reduces the norepinephrine-enhanced motility of S. Typhimurium . 
A 1 ml aliquot of each washed bacterial strain ( BSX 8 , WT ; BBS 10 , qseC ) was spotted onto DMEM 0.3 % motility agar containing norepinephrine ( 50 mM ) and the zone diameter was measured following 16 h of growth at 37 1C . 
To conﬁrm the up-regulation of motility genes in response to norepinephrine , a phenotypic assay for motility was performed . 
S. Typhimurium was spotted on DMEM motility medium with and without 50 mM norepinephrine . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , norepinephrine present in the medium enhanced the motility of S. Typhimurium . 
Phentolamine , an a-adrenergic antagonist , eliminated the norepinephrine-enhanced motility of S. Typhimurium , indicating that Salmonella has an adrenergic receptor that responds to norepinephrine similar to the epinephrine receptor ( QseC ) described in E. coli [ 18 ] . 
In addition to norepinephrine , the motility of S. Typhimurium was enhanced on DMEM motility medium containing 10 % pre-conditioned DMEM from the wild-type strain , indicating that an AI is present in the pre-conditioned medium ( data not shown ) . 
3.3. The QseC sensor kinase regulates S. Typhimurium motility
The gene `` cascade '' for motility is regulated by the master regulators , FlhDC [ 17 ] . 
Since the ﬂhDC genes are regulated by the two-component system QseBC , a qseC mutant of S. Typhimurium was constructed to investigate the role of the QseC sensor kinase in norepinephrine-enhanced motility of S. Typhimurium . 
A dramatic decrease in motility zone diameter was observed for the qseC mutant compared to the wild-type parent strain in the presence of norepinephrine , suggesting that the qseBC quorum-sensing system is required for optimal induction of motility in response to norepinephrine ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Monitoring of bacterial growth by optical density revealed similar growth rates for the qseC mutant and wild-type strains ( data not shown ) . 
3.4. QseC is involved in S. Typhimurium colonization of swine
In addition to transcriptional regulation of ﬂagellar assembly , the QseBC quorum-sensing system also regulates the expression of virulence genes and is important for E. coli pathogenicity in a rabbit model [ 18 ] .

The zone diameter was measured following 18 h of growth at 37 1C .

The quorum sensing QseC sensor kinase is involved in swine colonization pathogens may recognize the in vivo conditions of the host gastrointestinal tract via quorum-sensing systems to thereby activate motility and virulence gene expression , an in vivo competition assay was performed to determine if the S. Typhimurium qseC gene is important for swine colonization . 
Fecal samples on days 1 -- 7 post-inoculation revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in shedding of the qseC mutant compared to the wild-type strain ( Table 2 ) . 
Furthermore , fewer colony-forming units of the qseC mutant than the wild-type strain were recovered from the tonsils , ileal Peyer 's Patches , ileocecal lymph nodes , and cecum at 7 days post-inoculation ( dpi ) ( Table 3 ) . 
A signi-ﬁcant decline in tonsil colonization by the qseC mutant was also observed at 14 dpi ( CI 1/4 0.154 , P-value 1/4 0.023 ) . 
Since the majority of the colonization data for the ileal Peyer 's Patches , ileocecal lymph nodes , and cecum at 14 dpi was qualitative ( + / ) , the CI and P-value could not be determined for the Salmonella strains in these organs . 
Thus , the competitive disadvantage of the qseC mutant in vivo indicates an important role for the quorum-sensing sensor kinase , QseC , in swine colonization . 
To determine if the qseC gene is important for host cell invasion , an in vitro invasion assay using the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC J2 was conducted . 
A signiﬁcant ( Po0 .05 ) fourfold decrease in bacterial invasion of the IPEC J2 cells by the qseC mutant ( 0.19 % invasion ) compared to the parent strain ( 0.77 % invasion ) was observed .

4. Discussion
Mammalian cells communicate through hormones , and in a similar manner , bacteria produce hormone-lik molecules for cell-to-cell communication termed quorum sensing . 
Cross-talk between these cell communication molecules may occur when bacteria reside in a mammalian host [ 4 ] , suggesting that host hormones such as norepi-nephrine may signal to the microorganism of their in vivo environment . 
In fact , in vitro studies have shown epinephr-ine/norepinephrine to promote bacterial growth by providing iron to the bacterial cell via enterochelin [ 19,20 ] , induce cellular adherence [ 21,22 ] , trigger virulence gene expression [ 23 -- 25 ] , and enhance bacterial motility [ 4 ] . 
Sperandio et al. have demonstrated that epinephrine / norepinephrine is a quorum-sensing signal for E. coli that enhances motility via the QseBC two-component system [ 4 ] . 
Our research has demonstrated that norepinephrine enhances motility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-murium on DMEM motility medium and that a qseC mutant has decreased motility compared to the wild-type strain . 
Our interest in the norepinephrine-enhanced moti-lity of S. Typhimurium was initiated by the identiﬁcation by DNA microarray analysis of a large number of motility genes ( 420 ) transcriptionally activated in the presence of norepinephrine . 
Motility genes are expressed in a cascade with `` early , middle , and late '' genes expressed in sequential order [ 17 ] . 
The early genes , ﬂhDC , encode the FlhDC master regulator complex which dictates the s70-dependent transcription of the middle genes . 
Expression of the middle genes results in the assembly of the ﬂagellar motor intermediate structure known as the hook-basal body . 
The ﬂiA gene is a middle gene that encodes the alternate sigma factor , FliA ( s28 ) , required for transcription of the late genes that complete ﬂagellar assembly via the synthesis of the external ﬁlament . 
In our study , real-time RT-PCR revealed signiﬁcant transcriptional activation of the early ﬂhC gene and middle ﬂiA and ﬂiY genes in response to norepinephrine exposure . 
The most highly expressed motility gene in our microarray analysis was the late gene ﬂjB , and real-time RT-PCR conﬁrmed a 15-fold increase in gene expression during norepinephrine exposure . 
However , most of the differential expression of the motility genes observed in the microarray assays was not dramatic between the two conditions tested ( + / norepinephrine ) . 
Several explanations may account for the low level of differential expression within the motility genes . 
The regulatory cascade of motility genes results in signal ampliﬁcation at each step ; hence , when the late genes are expressed , their expression is greater compared to early and middle genes . 
Our quantitative RT-PCR data illustrated signal ampliﬁcation with the lowest to highest fold transcriptional induction observed in the sequential order of early ( ﬂhC ) , middle ( ﬂiA and ﬂiY ) , and late ( ﬂjB ) genes . 
An alternative reason for the low level of differential expression of the motility genes is that during bacterial growth , AI-3 is presumably synthesized and secreted into the medium . 
The presence of AI-3 in the medium may induce expression of motility genes even in the absence of norepinephrine and , therefore , diminish the differential gene expression measured in the presence vs. absence of norepinephrine . 
The presence of 5 % or 10 % pre-conditioned medium enhances motility of S. Typhi-murium on DMEM motility medium , indicating that even when diluted , the level of AI-3 is sufﬁcient to effect gene expression . 
Further yet , motility genes may be maximally expressed on semi-solid medium ( motility assays ) compared to a broth culture ( microarray assays ) , since the ﬂagellum appears to be able to sense wetness on a surface and affect gene expression via the transcription inhibitor , FlgM [ 26 ] . 
However , in their investigation of gene expression during swarming , Wang et al. [ 27 ] were unable to measure a swarming-speciﬁc induction of ﬂagellar gene expression on swarm medium . 
Lastly , our gene expression analysis did not measure post-transcriptional mechanisms that may regulate motility . 
Several reports have correlated motility with virulence gene expression in Salmonella [ 28 -- 31 ] . 
Our in vivo competition experiment comparing the colonization potential of the qseC mutant to the wild-type parent strain in swine indicates that the competitive ﬁtness of the qseC mutant is not as robust as the wild-type strain . 
Furthermore , an in vitro invasion assay with the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC J2 suggests an invasion deﬁciency for the qseC mutant . 
Hence , we have demonstrated multiple phenotypes associated with the qseC gene : motility , cellular invasion , and in vivo competitive ﬁtness . 
Whether the decrease in swine colonization by the qseC mutant is due to impaired motility , invasion or another yet unidentiﬁed colonization/virulence phenotype is currently unknown . 
Although this investigation identiﬁed a coloni-zation deﬁciency for the qseC mutant , additional animal experiments need to be performed to determine whether a qseC mutant is attenuated for virulence in the swine model of infection . 
Nonetheless , the competition experiment suggests that sensing AI-3 / epinephrine/norepinephrine in the swine gastrointestinal tract environment is important for optimal colonization . 
The ability of Salmonella to sense and respond to norepinephrine produced by the host has potential food safety consequences . 
Salmonella has a ubiquitous distribution in animals , including pigs . 
The on-farm prevalence of a pig shedding Salmonella in feces is 6 -- 8 % [ 32,33 ] . 
Although pigs colonized with Salmonella can exhibit clinical symptoms , they are usually asymptomatic carriers of the pathogen . 
Salmonella-carrier pigs are a serious food safety issue because they have the potential to shed the pathogen in their feces , contaminating their neighboring penmates and the environment . 
A possible result of in vivo exposure of Salmonella to norepinephrine ( produced by stressed pigs during transportation and marketing ) is recrudescence from carrier pigs and shedding during lairage , resulting in pen contamination and exposure of concurrent and subsequent pigs to the pathogen immediately prior to entering the processing plant . 
Hence , a scenario could be envisioned whereby Salmonella are shed in the environment by stressed carrier pigs ; the Salmonella , expressing their virulence genes ( due to norepinephrin exposure ) , are ingested by stressed , Salmonella-free pigs that have decreased peristaltic activity of the gastrointest-inal tract ( due to stress-induced norepinephrine release ) , resulting in the `` primed '' pathogens being retained in their preferred site of invasion . 
The a-adrenergic antagonist , phentolamine , eliminated the norepinephrine-enhanced motility of the wild-type strain . 
Thus , a potential strategy for Salmonella intervention is to disrupt colonization via quenching of the quorum signal , thereby inhibiting quorum sensing .
