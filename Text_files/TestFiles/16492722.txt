Objectives : To determine the contribution of the AcrAB efflux system to cyclohexane tolerance in Salmonella enterica . 
Methods : The expression of the efflux pump gene , acrB , and regulators marA and soxS from 46 isolates of S. enterica of 14 different serovars was determined by comparative RT -- PCR and denaturing HPLC analysis . 
Results : Twenty-one of the 46 isolates were cyclohexane tolerant , a phenotype associated with multiple antibiotic resistance ( MAR ) and overexpression of efflux pumps . 
Of the cyclohexane-tolerant isolates 81 % were MAR , whereas only 44 % of the cyclohexane-susceptible isolates were MAR , confirming the association between cyclohexane tolerance and MAR. . 
However , there was no correlation between cyclohexane tolerance or MAR and overexpression of acrB , soxS or marA . 
Conclusions : These data suggest that cyclohexane tolerance in S. enterica can be mediated by an acrB-independent mechanism . 
Keywords : multiple antibiotic resistance , efflux , AcrAB , organic solvents 
Introduction
There has been an increase in the number of bacteria being isolated that are resistant to multiple antibiotics . 
Two distinct mechanisms that contribute to this resistance have been identified . 
Multiple drug resistance ( MDR ) can be determined by acquisition of multiple specific antibiotic resistance genes carried on plasmids and integrons . 
Multiple antibiotic resistance ( MAR ) 1 results from mutations that reduce accumulation of multiple anti-biotics by the cell in a non-specific manner . 
One mechanism of 1 resistance , which appears to be particularly important in MAR in Enterobacteriaceae , is the overexpression of efflux pumps . 
In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , overproduction of the efflux pump AcrAB has been shown to confer MAR and to also confer resistance to several non-antibiotic chemicals , such as dyes , detergents and biocides ( disinfectants ) . 
In both E. coli and S. enterica the global regu-2 -- 4 lators MarA and SoxS regulate the acrAB operon by binding to mar/sox boxes found downstream of the local repressor acrR . 
5 -- 11 
Both activators belong to the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional activators , and it has been shown that constitutive overexpression of either can confer clinically significant levels of antibiotic resistance in E. coli mediated by derepression of acrAB . 
9,11 Organic solvents are toxic to bacteria and accumulate in the cytoplasmic membrane , where they disrupt vital membrane functions and also inhibit membrane protein functions . 
The intrinsic 12 susceptibility to organic solvents differs between different bacterial species . 
The toxicity of different organic solvents varies and they can be ranked on the basis of the lowest logarithm of the partition coefficient ( log Pow ) of the given solvent in an equi-molar mixture of n-octanol and water . 
Wild-type S. enterica 13 and E. coli can grow in the presence of hexane ( log Pow = 3.5 ) but not in the presence of cyclohexane ( log Pow = 3.2 ) ; as a result hexane is considered the index solvent for both species . 
An 14 association between MAR and increased organic solvent tolerance ( i.e. tolerance to cyclohexane ) has been observed for E. coli and S. enterica . 
In E. coli acrB overexpression mediated 11 15 by overproduction of MarA , SoxS and Rob has been shown to result in cyclohexane tolerance . 
Therefore , it has been sugges-11 ted that overexpression of efflux pumps can result in both MAR and organic solvent tolerance in serovars of S. enterica . 
The 15 aim of the present study was to determine whether there was a correlation between MAR , organic solvent tolerance and expression of efflux-associated genes in S. enterica . 
Comparative ( C ) RT -- PCR was used to determine the expression of efflux-asso-7 ciated genes in 21 cyclohexane-tolerant isolates and 25 cyclo-hexane-susceptible isolates of S. enterica .

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, growth and storage
Forty-six S. enterica were isolated from livestock species in Great Britain by the Veterinary Laboratory Agency ( VLA ) . 
These isolates were representative of the 14 most commonly isolated serovars in England and Wales , which themselves were representative of Sal-monellae isolated from animals during 1997 -- 2000 . 
The 46 isolates 15 were chosen on the basis of serovar , ciprofloxacin MIC and mutation in the QRDR of gyrA , gyrB , parC and/or parE . 
Of the 28 cipro-floxacin-resistant isolates , all carried substitutions within GyrA and 9 also carried substitutions within ParC . 
Of the 18 isolates with an MIC of ciprofloxacin below 0.25 mg/L , 3 carried substitutions within GyrA , 9 carried substitutions within ParC and no isolates had substitutions within both GyrA and ParC . 
The most common substitutions identified were at codon 83 of GyrA where serine was replaced with phenylalanine in 14 isolates , tyrosine in 11 isolates and glycine in 1 isolate . 
Mutations were also identified at codon 87 of GyrA in six isolates ( aspartic acid to asparagine or glycine ) . 
The only substitution identified within ParC was a threonine to serine change at codon 57 . 
Isolates were serotyped by a microagglutination method and , where appropriate , were phage typed . 
All isolates were from geographically and temporally distinct samples . 
Isolates were also analysed by PFGE , which confirmed that no clones were examined . 
These 46 non-replicate isolates comprised 21 cyclohexane-tolerant isolates and 25 cyclohexane-susceptible isolates ( Table 1 ) . 
Fourteen different serovar wild-type , antibiotic-susceptible control NCTC / ATCC type strains were used throughout this study . 
In addition , two laboratory-selected cyclohexane-tolerant mutants ( Salmonella Typhimurium L115 and L657 ) were isolated from veterinary isolate L113 and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 respectively , following 3 the method of George and Levy . 
Both L113 and SL1344 are fully susceptible to antibiotics including ciprofloxacin . 
Two further labor-atory mutants with the tolC or acrB genes disrupted were also used : L108 ( tolC : : aph ) and L643 ( acrB : : aph ) . 
All strains were grown 7 on Iso-Sensitest medium ( Unipath ) aerobically at 37 C for 18 -- 24 h. All strains were stored on ProtectTM beads ( Technical Service Consultants , Lancashire , UK ) at -- 80 C. 
Susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics, dyes, detergents and disinfectants
The MIC of each agent was determined using the standard British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy ( BSAC ) doubling agar dilu-16 tion . 
MIC breakpoint concentrations used were those recommended by the BSAC , except for ciprofloxacin , where a cut-off value of 0.25 mg/L was used to define resistance as suggested by other workers . 
Isolates that were resistant to three or more antibiotics 17 of separate classes were considered to be MAR. . 
MDR isolates were identified as those that carried three or more specific resistance determinants conferring resistance to antibiotics of different classes . 
The tolerance of all isolates to hexane and cyclohexane ( Sigma ) was 14 determined according to the method of Aono et al. . 
Presence of specific resistance genes
In order to determine the contribution of specific resistance determ-inants to the antibiotic resistance , the presence of the aadB , aphAI , aadA1 , aadA2 , bla ( Carb ( 2 ) ) or pse1 , bla ( Tem ) , catA1 ( AY123253 ) ,

Expression of 16S rRNA, gyrB, marA, soxS and acrB disinfectants, dyes and detergents
RNA isolation , reverse transcription , multiplex PCR amplification of 16S rRNA , marA , soxS and acrB and PCR product quantification by denaturing HPLC analysis was exactly as described previously . 
16S 7 rRNA and gyrB were included as control genes whose expression and copy number was not expected to differ significantly under the experimental conditions used in this study . 
A comparison of 18 expression of both these genes from all serovar type strains indicated no significant difference in expression of either amongst all the serovar type strains and a very similar pattern of expression for each gene ( see the Results section ) . 
Values obtained for gyrB were generally lower than those obtained for 16S rRNA and so were less sensitive measures of experimental fluctuations . 
As a result of these experiments 16S rRNA was considered a suitable candidate to use as a reference gene and was used for the rest of the expression analysis . 
Subsequent differences in amplification efficiencies amongst cDNA preparations were normalized by referring the peak area of each amplicon resulting from the 16S rRNA amplification to that of each amplicon resulting from the mean value of the control strain 16S rRNA amplifications . 
To gain an accurate mean value for 16S rRNA levels on which to base the normalization , five independent PCR amplifications from the cDNA of three separate RNA preparations from each control strain were used . 
The peak areas for marA , soxS and acrB were adjusted as necessary to compensate for variations between the mRNA levels in each RNA preparation . 
7 Data are presented as means -- standard deviations from at least three independent PCR amplifications . 
All comparisons between control strains and veterinary isolates were compared by Student 's t-test . 
A P value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant change in gene expression . 
Data are expressed as fold changes in expression relative to the average expression of that gene by all wild-type serovars , i.e. a 1.5-fold increase is equivalent to a 50 % increase in transcript level . 
Susceptibility of isolates to cyclohexane, antibiotics,
The MICs of nine antibiotics , two dyes and the biocide triclosan were determined for all isolates and control strains . 
Twenty-nine of the 46 ( 63 % ) isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin . 
Thirtyone ( 67 % ) of the 46 isolates were resistant to tetracycline and 22 ( 48 % ) were resistant to chloramphenicol ( Table 2 ) . 
Fourteen isolates were resistant to ampicillin , whereas only six isolates were resistant to trimethoprim ( data not shown ) . 
No resistance to kanamycin , paraquat or deoxycholate was detected . 
The MICs of acriflavine , ethidium bromide and triclosan for all 46 isolates were similar to those for the control strains ( Table 2 ) . 
Twenty-eight of the 46 isolates ( 61 % ) were resistant to three or more antibiotics ( 10 MDR , 18 MAR ) . 
All the isolates were tolerant to hexane and 21 ( 46 % ) of the isolates were tolerant to cyclohexane ( Table 3 ) . 
Of these 21 isolates , 13 ( 62 % ) were resistant to cipro-floxacin and 17 out of 21 ( 81 % ) were resistant to three or more antibiotics ( 13 MAR , 4 MDR ) . 
Of the 25 cyclohexane-susceptible isolates , 16 ( 64 % ) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 11 ( 44 % ) isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotics ( 3 MAR , 8 MDR ) . 
The MICs of ciprofloxacin , chloramphenicol and tetracycline for the laboratory-selected cyclohexane-tolerant mutants ( L115 and L657 ) were 2 - to 4-fold higher than those for L113 or SL1344 . 
Two laboratory mutants of SL1344 with disruption of either acrB or tolC were unable to grow in the presence of hexane , indicating a decrease in organic solvent tolerance in the absence of these genes . 
Prevalence of resistance genes
Specific resistance genes were detected previously amongst both 1 cyclohexane-tolerant and cyclohexane-susceptible isolates . 
Four of 21 ( 19 % ) cyclohexane-tolerant isolates carried resistance genes and 8 of 25 ( 32 % ) cyclohexane-susceptible isolates carried resistance genes . 
Of the 17 cyclohexane-tolerant isolates resistant to three or more antibiotics , 4 ( 24 % ) carried specific resistance genes , and 8 of 11 ( 73 % ) cyclohexane-susceptible isolates resistant to three or more antibiotics carried specific resistance genes . 
The most commonly detected genes were aadA2 , floR and sul1 , each found in six isolates . 
Many isolates carried a combination of resistance genes ; the most common pattern of carriage was four genes seen in four isolates ( the resistance genes varied between isolates ) .

Gene expression amongst serovar control strains
The expression of 16S rRNA and gyrB was determined for all serovar control strains . 
Figure 1 shows the mean standard deviation from the average expression for both genes . 
The pattern of expression of both 16S rRNA and gyrB was similar and there was little variation between both genes . 
For expression data from veterinary isolates 16S rRNA was used as a control to normalize variations in expression . 
The average level of expression of marA , soxS and acrB from all serovar controls was calculated and used as a reference for comparison of data from veterinary isolates ( after normalization ) in the absence of isogenic controls . 
Expression of acrB, marA and soxS in veterinary isolates
The mean peak area from Wave DHPLC analysis for 16S TM rRNA for the 14 control serovars was 176185 -- 19380 ( 100 -- 11 % ) . 
The mean peak areas of marA , soxS and acrB for all the control serovars was 129 737 -- 18 163 ( 100 -- 14 % ) , 48 273 -- 5793 ( 100 -- 12 % ) and 226 241 -- 20 362 ( 100 -- 9 % ) , respect-ively . 
There were no significant differences in the mean peak areas for marA , soxS or acrB for all the control strains except for Salmonella Livingstone , which had significantly higher levels of soxS . 
To determine whether this isolate of Salmonella Livingstone was typical for this serovar , expression in a second wildtype strain , Salmonella Livingstone NCTC 9125 , was determined . 
This strain also showed significantly higher levels of soxS ; thus the average of the mean peak areas from these two control strains was used for comparison with the isolates of Salmonella Livingstone . 
Analysis of the cyclohexane-susceptible , ciprofloxacinsusceptible isolates ( n = 9 ) revealed only one isolate ( L649 ) that significantly overexpressed soxS ( 1.27-fold ) and acrB ( 1.64-fold ) ( Figure 2 ) . 
Two isolates expressed significantly less soxS transcript ( 0.51 - to 0.66-fold ) compared with the mean value for the control strains ( Figure 2 ) . 
Two isolates expressed significantly less marA transcript ( 0.59-fold ) and four isolates expressed significantly less acrB ( 0.59 - to 0.78-fold ) compared with the mean values for the control strains . 
The remainder of the isolates showed no significant change in expression for soxS ( 0.8 - to 1.09-fold ) , marA ( 0.69 -- 1.08 ) and acrB ( 0.7 -- 1.37 ) compared with the mean values for the control strains . 
Three of 16 cyclohexane-susceptible , ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had significantly increased marA expression ( 1.22 - to 1.44-fold ) . 
Four isolates had significantly decreased expression

No significant acrB overexpression was detec-ted with these isolates ; however , three isolates significantly underexpressed acrB ( 0.57 - to 0.75-fold ) . 
The remainder showed no change in expression ( 0.72 - to 1.23-fold ) compared with the mean value for the control strains . 
Two cyclohexane-tolerant Salmonella Typhimurium mutants ( L115 and L657 ) were selected in the laboratory .

However , the level of marA transcript was significantly increased by 1.17-fold ( P = 0.025 ) compared with L113 .

Discussion
Cyclohexane tolerance has been proposed to be a cheap and quick marker for MAR mediated by overexpression of efflux genes . 
14,15 Of the 46 strains tested 28 were resistant to three or more anti-biotics , the most common phenotype being resistance to a fluoroquinolone , tetracycline and chloramphenicol . 
Cyclohexane tolerance was seen in 21 out of 46 isolates ( 46 % ) , of which 17 were resistant to three or more antibiotics ( 81 % ; 15 MAR , 2 MDR ) and 13 ( 62 % ) were ciprofloxacin resistant . 
All the cyclohexane-tolerant , ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates carried substitutions at codon 83 of GyrA and three also carried a substitution at codon 57 of ParC . 
These data confirm the association between cyclohexane tolerance and resistance to multiple antibiotics . 
However , 19 % of cyclohexane-tolerant mutants were not MAR or MDR , indicating a significant level of false-positive results from this test . 
Of the 25 cyclohexane-susceptible isolates 11 ( 44 % ) were resistant to three or more antibiotics , in contrast to the cyclohexane-tolerant isolates . 
The majority of these isolates were MDR ( seven ) rather than MAR ( five ) , indicating that the presence of specific resistance genes accounted for most of the isolates that were cyclohexane susceptible and resistant to three or more antibiotics . 
Artificial overexpression of marA , soxS and rob on a plasmid has been shown to lead to increased organic solvent tolerance in E. coli as has overexpression of marA in Salmonella Typh-11 ,15 imurium . 
In this study there was no clear association between cyclohexane tolerance and increased expression of marA , soxS or acrB . 
No overexpression of acrB was seen in any cyclohexanetolerant isolate or laboratory mutant , which is counterintuitive as acrB has been shown to mediate intrinsic tolerance to organic solvents in E. coli , and the Salmonella Typhimurium strains lacking acrB or tolC were less tolerant to organic solvents than wild-type strains . 
However , amongst the cyclohexane-toler-ant , ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates , 8 of 13 strains overexpressed either marA or soxS , although none of these strains overexpressed acrB . 
It is unclear whether overexpression of marA or soxS in these strains is contributing to their MAR phenotype in an acrB-independent manner . 
It would appear that cyclohexane tolerance in Salmonella Typhimurium can be mediated by a mechanism other than overexpression of acrB . 
There are numerous other efflux pumps in Salmonella , including AcrD and AcrF , that are highly homolog-19 ous to the AcrAB system . 
Kobayashi et al. showed overexpression of acrE and acrF were able to restore organic solvent tolerance in an acrB-inactivated E. coli mutant . 
However , Eaves et al. failed to detect an association between expression of 7 acrF or acrD and MAR or cyclohexane tolerance in S. enterica . 
Alternatively , the MarA homologue RamA ( RmaA ) has been shown to be able to mediate a MAR phenotype in a range of Enterobacteriaceae , including S. enterica . 
It may be that this 20 gene or another regulator is involved in mediating cyclohexane tolerance in an acrB-independent manner . 
In conclusion , whilst several publications on E. coli show that overexpression of marA , soxS , rob and/or the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC system are associated with organic solvent tolerance , this study shows that the same is not true for isolates of various serovars of S. enterica . 
The effector ( s ) of cyclohexane tolerance in S. enterica remain unknown ; further experiments are in progress to identify the alternative effectors of cyclohexane tolerance in S. enterica .
