Abstract : The hypervariable D3 domain of Salmonella flagellin , composed of the 190-285 segment , is the major determinant of flagellar antigenicity . 
D3 was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli . 
Although previous studies concluded that D3 is stabilized by interactions with the D2 domain , our calorimetric experiments have revealed that isolated D3 has a stable tertiary structure which is highly resistant against proteolytic digestion . 
Repeated heating experiments demonstrated that unfolding of D3 is reversible . 
Its small size and stable structure makes D3 a promising protein scaffold for the develop ¬ 
ment of artificial binding proteins by directed evolution .

1. INTRODUCTION
Flagella are the locomotive organelles of bacteria . 
The helical filaments of bacterial flagella extend over the surface of the cell membrane and are made of several tens of thousands copies of the flagellin protein [ 1 ] . 
Flagellin from Sal-monella typhimurium consists of 494 amino acid residues [ 2 ] . 
Comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed a high degree of homology in the terminal regions containing about 180 N-terminal and 100 C-terminal amino acids , whereas the central segments are highly variable [ 3-5 ] . 
The molecular mass of flagellins of different origin varies in a wide range ( 28-65 kDa ) and the differences are due to the various sizes of the central region . 
Concerning the structure of the flagellar filament , the flagellin subunits arrange themselves into 11 protofilaments [ 1 ] . 
Only the conserved terminal regions of flagellin subunits are involved in filament formation while the central part of the amino acid sequence forms the D2-D3 domains which project out from the filament core [ 6,7 ] . 
D3 is the outermost domain which is exposed on the filament surface . 
This domain is not in contact with the adjacent subunits and has no significant role in the construction of the filament structure . 
The D3 domain is constituted by the 190-285 segment of the amino acid sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium flagellin . 
It contains an unusual fold called - folium composed of a series of - hairpins all pointing away from one another like three thin leaves spread out . 
D3 can tolerate large insertions and deletions [ 5,8,9 ] , and is mainly responsible for the antigenic variability in bacterial flagella [ 10 ] . 
The ability to alter the surface characteristics of flagellar filaments confers a selection advantage for the bacterium by avoiding immune response .

Here we addressed the structural stability of the isolated D3 domain . 
D3 was overexpressed in E. coli and its stability and refolding ability was characterized by scanning micro-calorimetry and limited proteolysis . 
Its small size and structural flexibility makes D3 a promising target for directed evolution studies to create artificial binding proteins . 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Cloning, Protein Expression and Purification
The gene segment encoding the D3 domain of flagellin , residues 190-285 , was amplified by PCR from S. typhi-murium SJW1103 wilde type strain . 
Oligonucleotide primers 5 ' GCGGCTAGCGGATATGCCGATAC-3 ' and 5 ' - GCGG CGGCCGCTGCAACTTGT-ACATTTTTCACATCCTC-3 ' containing an NheI and NotI cleavage site , respectively , were designed based on the flanking nucleotide sequences of the D3 domain . 
After digestion with NheI and NotI the PCR product was ligated into a NheI/NotI digested pET21c vector . 
E. coli strain TOP 10 ( Invitrogen ) was transformed with the ligation mixture using the CaCl2 procedure [ 11 ] . 
The resulting construct was checked by sequencing . 
D3 with a C-terminal His6-tag was overproduced in E. coli cells , strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS . 
1 ml from 20 ml over-night culture was inoculated into 100 ml of LB broth , supplemented with Ampicillin ( 100 μg / ml ) and Chlorampheni-o col ( 30 μg / ml ) and incubated at 37 C to reach an OD600 of 0.6 . 
After addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM , incubation was continued for another 4 hours . 
The bacterial pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min o and stored at -20 C. 
Purification of D3-His6 was performed as follows : the bacterial pellet from 100 ml culture was resuspended in 10 ml 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , pH = 7.4 , and sonicated on ice to lyse the cells for 1 min 5 times at power of 10W . 
The solution was centrifugated at 40000 rpm 20 min at 4 C to remove cell debris . 
The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . 
The absorbed proteins were eluted using a linear imidazole gradient ( 50 mM-200 mM ) , the D3-His6 was eluted at about 150 mM imidazole .

The protein concentration of samples was determined from absorption measurements at 280 nm using an extinction 1 % coefficient ( E = 6.68 ) calculated from the known aromatic amino acid contents of the molecule [ 12 ] . 
Purity of protein samples was checked by SDS-PAGE using 12.5 % and 20 % polyacrylamide gels , stained with Coomassie blue R-250 ( Merck ) . 
2.2. Limited Proteolysis
Limited proteolysis of D3 by trypsin was performed in 10mM phosphate buffer , pH 7.0 , containing 150 mM NaCl at room temperature at a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml . 
In a typical digestion experiment , D3 was incubated with the protease at a 300:1 ( w/w ) ratio . 
At various times 10 μl samples were removed and mixed with 10 μl electrophoretic sample buffer , followed immediately by heating in a boiling water-bath for three minutes . 
Electrophoresis was performed on SDS/12 .5 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide slab gels .

Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against the buffer at 4 °C . 
In the calculations of molar thermodynamic quantities , the molecular mass used was 11.2 kDa for His-tagged D3 .

2.4. CD Measurements
Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in the range of 185 to 250 nm at 0.5 nm intervals on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter . 
Samples were measured at room temperature in cylindrical fused quartz cells with a path length of 0.1 cm in 10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 7.0 ) at a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml . 
3. RESULTS
3.1. Preparation of His-tagged D3
The gene segment encoding the D3 domain of flagellin was amplified by PCR from S. typhymurium SJW1103 wild type strain and ligated into a pET21c vector . 
E. coli strain TOP 10 was transformed with the ligation mixture . 
D3 with C-terminal His6-tag was overproduced in E. coli cells , strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS , and was purified by Ni-chelating affinity chromatography . 
From 1L culture 20-30 mg D3 was usually obtained . 
The obtained D3 preparation was homogeneous on SDS polyacrylamide gels ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In addition to the 190-285 segment of wild type Salmonella typhimurium flagellin , our D3 construct contained the AS and AALEHHHHHH flanking sequences at the N - and C-termini , respectively . 
3.2. Resistance Against Proteases
Although D3 contains 8 lysine ( but no arginine ) residues , it proved to be highly resistant even against a prolonged tryptic digestion . 
The time course of tryptic degradation is presented in Fig. 1 , as monitored on SDS/PAGE . 
The band corresponding to the intact D3 molecule prevailed for a long time . 
In control experiments , the disordered terminal regions of monomeric flagellin were completely degraded in less than 5 minutes under identical conditions ( data not shown ) . 
The obtained degradation pattern indicates that there are significant structural constraints to limit the accessibility of the peptide bonds at the possible cleavage sites . 
This observation strongly suggests that D3 has a compact , well-folded tertiary structure .

3.3. Characterization of Thermal Stability
Adiabatic scanning microcalorimetry was employed to characterize the structural stability of isolated D3 . 
Measurements were performed at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml . 
Melting profiles of D3 were obtained by DSC in the 20-60ºC region , and presented in Fig. 2 . 
D3 exhibited a single sharp endotherm with a midpoint temperature of Tm = 46.0 ºC , where Tm is defined as the temperature of the maximal heat capacity . 
Sequential heating experiments revealed that temperature induced unfolding of D3 was highly reversible indicating that D3 is an autonomous folding unit . 
The area below the heat absorption peak corresponds to the enthalpy of protein denaturation at the transition temperature . 
The melting transition of D3 was accompanied by an enthalpy change of 360 ( ± 40 ) kJ/mol . 
From the shape of the measured heat absorption curve we can also calculate the Va n't Hoff enthalpy of the melting process assuming that this process is a two-state transition [ 13 ] . 
Comparison of the calorimetric and Va n't Hoff enthalpy values can provide information about the mechanism of the denaturation proc-ess . 
In the case of D3 the calorimetric and Va n't Hoff enthalpy ( 382 kJ/mol ) values were very similar suggesting that its calorimetric profile reflects an all or none transition . 
This implies that D3 comprises a single folding unit . 
Thermal unfolding is accompanied by a significant increase , Cp = 4.2 kJ/mol/deg , in the heat capacity of D3 . 
The heat capacity difference between the native and unfolded states is a sensitive index of the compactness of the mole cule , since it is caused by the hydration of protein internal groups which are exposed to water upon protein unfolding . 
Only non-polar group hydration results in a rise in heat capacity [ 14 ] , therefore , the observed denaturational heat capacity change clearly shows that D3 has a well-developed hydrophobic core .

3.4. CD Measurements
The far-UV CD spectrum of D3 was recorded in the range of 185 to 250 nm ( Fig. 3 ) . 
D3 exhibits an unusual CD spectrum without any peaks in the 200-250 nm region , reminiscent to a random polypeptide . 
This spectrum shows similarities to that of the F27 fragment of flagellin ( residues 179-418 ) [ 15 ] , which is characterized by a negative minimum at 198 nm , resembling the CD spectra of denatured proteins . 
Some other native proteins also exhibit CD spectra with random coil characteristics [ 16 ] . 
Secondary structure of these proteins was found to be dominated by antiparalel - sheets , - turns and coil regions with a very low - helical content . 
Indeed , the high resolution structure of flagellin shows similar secondary structural characteristics for D3 . 
4. DISCUSSION
Although the CD spectrum of D3 is reminiscent to that of a random polypeptide , several lines of evidence suggest that it has a well-folded structure . 
D3 exhibits high resistance against proteolytic digestion indicating that it is composed of a compact structural unit . 
In addition , calorimetric measurements of D3 show that it has a cooperatively ordered structure with refolding ability . 
The observed large heat capacity increase upon thermal unfolding of D3 also demonstrates that D3 possesses a compact structure with a well-developed hydrophobic core . 
D3 is stable in a wide pH range , it exhibits a cooperative melting transition between pH 4.0 and 11.0 ( data not shown ) . 
In earlier studies , thermal denaturation of flagellin was deconvoluted into 3 unfolding transitions [ 17 ] . 
Based on the relative sizes of the D1-D3 domains , the 3rd transition was assigned to D3 . 
This transition was centered at 46.3 ºC and exhibited a calorimetric enthalpy change of ~ 310 kJ/mol . 
The thermodynamic parameters obtained for isolated D3 are very similar . 
Although , it was previously concluded that domains D2 and D3 interact and stabilize each other [ 17 ] , our results clearly show that D3 is a stable entity and its structural stability is not significantly influenced by the other parts of flagellin .

The scanning rate was 1ºC / min . 
D3 involves the most variable segments of flagellin . 
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of bacterial flagel-lins reveals that D3 is a natural framework domain which can tolerate large insertions and deletions [ 5,8 ] . 
This has been exploited in flagellar display technology where D3 is used for the insertion of immunogenic epitopes of viral proteins and various toxins to display them on the surface of flagellar filaments [ 18,19 ] . 
Since isolated D3 is stable , small in size , and can be produced in bacteria easily and inexpensively , we propose that it may serve as a scaffold [ 20 ] for the generation of novel binding proteins toward prescribed target molecules .
