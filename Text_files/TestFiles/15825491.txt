Abstract The diagnostic accuracy of a PCR used to identify horses shedding Salmonella spp . 
in their feces during hospitalization was estimated , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , using longitudinal data . 
Five or more fecal samples were collected from each of 116 horses admitted as inpatients , for reasons other than gastrointestinal disease , between July 26 , 2001 and October 25 , 2002 . 
All 873 fecal samples collected were tested with a PCR based on oligonucleotide primers deﬁning a highly conserved segment of the histidine transport operon gene of Salmonella typhimurium , and each sample was cultured for Salmonella spp . 
One or more samples from 87 ( 75 % ) horses were PCR positive , and Salmonella was cultured from 1 or more samples from 11 ( 9.5 % ) horses . 
All culture-positive horses had at least 1 PCR-positive result , whereas only 29 ( 28 % ) culture-negative horses were PCR negative on all fecal samples tested . 
The PCR was most speciﬁc , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , when used to test samples from Quarterhorse or breeds other than Thoroughbred or Standardbred , or from clinical ( vs. healthy , accompanying horses ) cases . 
Overall , the PCR had the greatest agreement ( 70 % ) , compared with bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , using a cutoff of 2 or more positive PCR test results to deﬁne a Salmonella-positive horse . 
The reasons why some fecal samples , from which Salmonella organisms can not be isolated , are PCR positive need to be determined before the PCR can be incorporated into Salmonella surveillance programs for hospitalized equine populations .

Introduction
Salmonellosis can be a serious disease in horses . 
Outbreaks of salmonellosis in veterinary teaching hospitals ( VTHs ) and clinics can result in substantial economic loss and adversely effect patient wellbeing .20 In these settings , the case fatality rate from salmonellosis may be as high as 45 % .4 A range of risk factors associated with salmonellosis has been identiﬁed , including diarrhea , large colon impaction or colic at the time of admission , and changes in diet , antibiotic treatment , and nasogastric tube intubation during hospitalization .14 -- 16,26 Stress is likely to be responsible for recrudescence of fecal shedding of Salmonella spp . 
in carrier horses .3,16 The prevalence of fecal shedding of Salmonella spp . 
among horses in the United States has been estimated to be 0.8 % .25 Estimates of the prevalence of Salmonella shedding in horses admitted to VTHs range from 1.4 % to .20 % .5,19,20,22,26 To effectively prevent the transmission of Salmo-nella spp . 
among hospitalized horses , horses known to be , or at risk of , shedding Salmonella spp . 
need to be isolated from the rest of the hospital population .

lation of Salmonella spp . 
by bacterial culture of feces provides deﬁnitive evidence that an equine patient is shedding Salmonella . 
However , not all patients shedding Salmonella may be detected by bacterial culture of fecal samples . 
Culture of several fecal samples collected over a period of days is required to reliably identify infected horses .23,27 More recently , a PCR based on oligonucleotide primers that detects members of the genus Salmonella has been developed .6 The advantage of using a PCR to monitor Salmonella infection in a population of hospitalized horses is that test results can be obtained more quickly than by bacterial culture ( # 24 hours vs. 3 -- 5 days ) ,7 thus allowing an earlier implementation of preventive measures such as isolation and barrier nursing and , therefore , minimizing the risk of infection to the rest of the hospital population . 
Despite the potential beneﬁts of monitoring Salmonella infections with a PCR , isolation of viable Salmonella spp . 
bacteria from fecal samples allows antimicrobial resistance testing of isolates to be done and permits serotyping and speciation of isolates . 
Such information is critical in determining the possible link between cases identiﬁed within a hospitalized population and in assessing the likelihood that nosocomial transmission has occurred . 
The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of a PCR , used to identify horses shedding Salmonella spp . 
in their feces during hospitalization , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples .

Materials and methods
Study design . 
Multiple fecal samples were collected from 130 horses admitted as inpatients to the Purdue University VTH between July 26 , 2001 and October 25 , 2002 , as part of a clinical trial on the use of probiotics to reduce fecal shedding of Salmonella spp .28 Horses hospitalized for treatment of gastrointestinal disease , such as colic or diarrhea , were excluded . 
A fecal sample ( 10 -- 20 g ) was collected from each horse at admission and then daily for as long as the horse was hospitalized or until 8 samples had been collected . 
Each fecal sample was cultured for Salmonella spp . 
A sample of the specimen was streaked directly onto brilliant green ( BG ) and xylose -- lysine -- tergitol ( XLT-4 ) plates , and then approximately 10 g of fecal material was inoculated into 100 ml of Tetrathionate Hajna broth . 
Brilliant green plates were incubated aerobically at 358 -- 378 C for 18 -- 24 hr and XLT-4 plates were incubated for 24 -- 48 hr . 
Tetrathionate broth was incubated aerobically at 358 -- 378 C for 24 -- 48 hr and then subcultured to BG and XLT-4 plates . 
These plates were incubated as described previously ,1 and suspect black colonies on XLT-4 agar plates were subcultured and further identiﬁed as Salmonella spp . 
using API 20E and serology .21 Isolates were serotyped and speciated ( National Veterinary Services Laboratories , Ames , IA ) . 
Salmonella was isolated from 36 ( 3.9 % ) of the 924 fecal samples collected from 130 horses enrolled in the probiotics trial . 
These isolates were serotyped as typhimurium ( 8 ) , meleagridis ( 7 ) , bovis-mor-biﬁcans ( 3 ) , mbandaka ( 14 ) , and muenster ( 4 ) . 
Serotypes typhimurium , meleagridis , bovis-morbiﬁcans , mbandaka , and muenster were isolated from 4 , 1 , 1 , 3 , and 2 horses , respectively . 
None of these horses developed clinical signs consistent with Salmonella spp . 
infection ( neutropenia , fever , or diarrhea ) during hospitalization . 
Each fecal sample was also tested for the presence of Sal-monella DNA using a PCR . 
To extract Salmonella DNA , 1 ml of enrichment broth was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 16,000 3 g for 10 min ; the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Tris ( 10 mM ) -- ethylenediaminetet-raacetic acid ( 0.1 mM ; pH , 8.0 ) . 
This suspension was then incubated at 1008 C for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,000 3 g for 5 min . 
Ten microliters of the supernatant was mixed to a ﬁnal volume of 50 ml with the following : 29.5 ml dou-ble-distilled ( dd ) H2O ; 5.0 ml 103 PCR buffer ; 1 ml deox-ynucleoside triphosphate ( 10 mM ) ; 0.5 ml each ( upper and lower strands ) of oligonucleotide primers of 25 bp deﬁning a highly conserved segment of the histidine transport operon gene of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ; 5 1 ml Taq ( 5 U / ml ) ; and 2.5 ml enhancer 103 . 
Ten nanograms of Salmonella DNA was used as a positive control , and 10 ml of ddH2O was used as a negative control . 
The reaction was run in a thermocycler for 35 cycles ( 958 C for 30 sec , 578 C for 30 sec , and 728 C for 60 sec ) , followed by a 5-min extension phase at 728 C . 
The PCR product was electrophoresed on 1.5 % agarose ethidium bromide ( 0.5 mg/ml ) gel at 100 V for 30 min , observed with an ultraviolet transilluminator , and photographed . 
Positive PCR assay results were identiﬁed by the presence of a 496-bp band on the gel . 
Analysis . 
Agreement between culture and PCR test results on individual fecal samples was estimated using the kappa statistic and 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) . 
a Information at admission ( age , sex , breed , presenting complaint ) and length of hospitalization were extracted from medical records . 
Logistic regression models13 were used to estimate the sensitivity of PCR , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , using horse as the unit of analysis logit Pr ( Y 5 1 z X ) 5 a 1 bX 1 e ( 1 ) where Y is the PCR test result ( PCR positive , Y 5 1 ; PCR negative , Y 5 0 ) , X is the culture result ( Salmonella isolated , X 5 1 ; Salmonella not isolated , X 5 0 ) , a and b are estimated coefﬁcients , and e is the variation unexplained by the model.b The speciﬁcity of the PCR was estimated , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , using the same model , in which X 5 0 and logit Pr ( Y 5 0 z X 5 0 ) 5 1 2 logit Pr ( Y 5 1 z X 5 0 ) 5 1 2 { 1 / [ exp ( a ) 1 1 ] } . 
For this analysis , 1 or more culture-positive results de-ﬁned a `` gold standard '' positive horse ; a horse in which 1 or more fecal samples were PCR test positive was considered PCR positive . 
The positive and negative predictive values of the PCR , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , were estimated ,13 respectively , as 
Bacterial culture is known to be an insensitive technique for detecting Salmonella spp . 
in fecal material .27 Sensitivity of culture for a single fecal sample from a horse has been estimated to be 55 % ,27 and it has been recommended that 5 or more consecutively collected fecal samples should be cultured to maximize the likelihood that Salmonella will be detected . 
Assuming independence and a sensitivity of 55 % , the culture of 5 or more fecal samples should provide a sensitivity of .98 % . 
Therefore , analysis was restricted to 116 horses from which $ 5 fecal samples had been cultured for Salmonella spp . 
From information contained in medical records , the following variables were created with respect to patient characteristics : age ( # 2 , 2.1 -- 19.9 , $ 20 yr ) , sex ( female , gelding , stallion ) , breed ( Quarterhorse , Standardbred , Thoroughbred , other ) , reason for admission ( disease vs. accompanying ) , and length of hospitalization ( ,7 , $ 7 days ) . 
The accompanying horses were healthy mares with a sick foal , and all other horses admitted were for a speciﬁc ( nongastrointestinal ) disease condition . 
For each variable created , sensitivity , speci-ﬁcity , and the predictive value of positive and negative PCR results , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , were calculated by incorporating each variable separately into a logistic regression model logit Pr ( Y 5 1 z X1 ) 5 a 1 b1X1 1 b2X2 1 e ( 4 ) where X1 is the culture result as deﬁned previously and X2 is the categorical covariate of interest.b In addition , the inﬂuence of the number of positive PCR test results on the horse-level accuracy of the PCR test , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , was investigated . 
A series of 2-by-2 tables was produced b categorizing each horse on the basis of culture status ( $ 1 positive results , vs. negative ) and PCR status ( $ 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , 7 PCR-positive results ) . 
For each PCR cutoff point , sensitivity and speciﬁcity , relative to the bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , were estimated and a receiver-op-erating characteristic ( ROC ) curve was constructed by plotting sensitivity versus 1 2 speciﬁcity . 
The area under the curve was estimated to describe the overall accuracy of PCR relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , and at each PCR cutoff point Youden 's index of diagnostic accuracy ( sensitivity 1 speciﬁcity 2 1 ) was calculated.a

Results
Of the 130 horses admitted to the VTH from which 924 fecal samples were collected , 5 or more fecal samples were collected from 116 horses ( 873 samples ) and cultured and tested with PCR . 
Therefore , the study population consisted of these 116 horses . 
The median number of samples collected per horse was 8 . 
Of these horses , 1 or more samples were PCR positive for 87 ( 75 % ) , and Salmonella was cultured from 1 or more sample from 11 ( 9.5 % ) horses . 
Overall , 285 ( 33 % ) samples were PCR positive , and Salmonella was cultured from 36 ( 4.1 % ) of these 873 samples . 
The proportion of horses culture positive was greatest ( .5 % ) on the ﬁfth , sixth , and seventh samplings ; the proportion of horses PCR positive was positively correlated with sample number , increasing from 24 % for the ﬁrst sampling to 42 % for the eighth sampling ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The median age of the study horses was 9 years . 
Fifteen ( 13 % ) , 87 ( 76 % ) , and 13 ( 11 % ) were # 2 , 2.1 -- 19.9 , and $ 20 years of age , respectively . 
Fifty ( 43 % ) , 56 ( 49 % ) , and 10 ( 9 % ) were female , geldings and stallions , respectively . 
The most common breeds represented were Quarterhorse ( 34 % ) , Thoroughbred 
( 15 % ) , and Standardbred ( 12 % ) . 
Forty-nine ( 42 % ) and 8 ( 7 % ) horses were admitted as donations and accompanying other patients , respectively . 
Forty other reasons for admission were recorded in medical records , the most common being lameness ( 13 % ) and neurological disease ( 5 % ) . 
Of the 36 fecal samples from which Salmonella was isolated , 21 ( 58 % ) were PCR positive , and of the 837 fecal samples from which Salmonella was not isolated , 573 ( 68 % ) were PCR negative ( kappa statistic 0.062 ; 95 % CI , 0.026 -- 0.098 ) . 
All 11 culture-positive horses had at least 1 PCR-positive result . 
Four of these culture-positive horses had 2 samples with PCR-positive results ; 2 horses each had 3 , 4 , or 5 samples with positive PCR results ; and 7 samples from 1 culture-positive horse were PCR positive . 
Of the 105 horses that were culture negative , 29 ( 28 % ) were PCR negative for all samples tested . 
The estimated speciﬁcity and predictive values of a positive PCR result , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples and adjusting for covar-iates , are shown in Table 1 . 
The PCR was most spe-ciﬁc , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , when used to test samples from mature ( .2 years ) horses , male horses , horses other than Standardbred and Thoroughbred , horses admitted for a disease condition , and horses hospitalized 7 days or more . 
In all cases , sensitivity relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , and , therefore , negative predictive values were 100 % . 
An ROC curve for each PCR cutoff point is shown in Fig. 2 . 
The area under the curve was 0.681 ( 95 % CI , 0.533 -- 0.828 ) . 
Youden 's index of diagnostic accuracy was greatest at a cutoff point of 2 positive PCR test results : all 11 culture-positive horses had $ 2 pos itive PCR results ( 100 % sensitivity , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples ) , but only 41 of 105 culture-negative horses had ,2 positive PCR results ( 39.1 % speciﬁcity , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples ) .

Discussion
Control of transmission of nosocomial Salmonella infections within populations of hospitalized horses can be achieved by identifying those patients shedding Salmonella spp . 
in their feces and preventing both direct and indirect contact between them and the general hospital population . 
In studies of horses admitted to VTHs in the United States , prevalence of Salmonella infection has been estimated to be 6 % ( California ) ,19 13 % ( Pennsylvannia ) ,22 10 -- 11 % ( Texas ) ,5,8 7 -- 9 % ( Colorado ) ,17,26 and 5 % ( Michigan ) ; 9 the prevalence of Salmonella infection ( based on bacterial culture ) in this study ( 9.5 % ) is consistent with these other studies . 
In VTHs , identiﬁcation of horses shedding Salmonella spp . 
using traditional bacterial culture techniques has been constrained by the suboptimal sensitivity of this method . 
To compensate for a lack of sensitivity , the culture of 5 or more fecal samples collected over a period of several days has been recommended .27 However , such an approach is unsuited to nosocomial infection control programs because of the lag in time between identiﬁcation of infected horses and their isolation from the general hospital population and the cost of performing multiple cultures . 
Thus , the greatest potential beneﬁt of PCR for identifying infected horses 2,5 is the speed with which results can be obtained as well as potentially reduced surveillance costs . 
Using fecal material contaminated in vitro with a known number of Salmonella bacteria , PCR and culture results have been shown to be consistent .8 However , in ﬁeld studies using fecal samples collected from horses admitted to a VTH , disagreement has been found ( more horses being PCR positive than culture positive ) .5,8 The speciﬁcity of the PCR , relative to bacterial culture of serially collected fecal samples , was unexpectedly low in this study . 
At least 5 fecal samples collected from each horse during hospitalization were cultured , and the results of all cultures was used as the gold standard to deﬁne horses shedding or not shedding Salmonella during hospitalization . 
Most ( 84 % ) horses included in this study had 7 or 8 samples cultured . 
Assuming the sensitivity of culture of a single sample to be 55 % ,27 it was estimated that the sensitivity of the culture strategy used was at least 98 % and for most horses was at least 99.6 % . 
Therefore , failure to culture Salmonella spp . 
from fecal samples collected from infected horses ( gold standard misspe-ciﬁcation ) is an unlikely explanation for the substantial number of positive PCR results in this study . 
In environmental studies recently conducted at the same VTH as this study , approximately 24 times as many environmental samples ( 49.9 % ) were PCR positive , as compared with positive results on bacteriologic culture ( 2.1 % ) .1 Similar results have been obtained at other VTHs .5,24 In the case of environmental sampling , it has been suggested that PCR-positive samples from which Salmonella can not be isolated may be caused by nonviable bacteria in the environment because of disinfectant use in VTHs .1 Similarly , the presence of nonviable Salmonella organisms in fecal samples may also occur if the sample has not been adequately handled before culture , if substances that inhibit the growth of Salmonella spp . 
under conventional bacterial culture are present in fecal samples , if the horse was given antimicrobials effective against Salmonella spp. , if the horse had consumed nonviable organisms from the environment , or if horses were shedding very low numbers of Salmonella bacteria in their feces . 
Inadequate handling of samples is an unlikely explanation for apparent ( using culture as the gold standard ) false-positive PCR results because samples were maintained at 48C until being processed at a laboratory ( colocated with the VTH ) , usually within 24 hours of collection . 
Bacterial culture with enrichment was used to isolate Salmonella . 
The same number of Salmonella colony forming units as PCR ,8 or even lower numbers ,7 can be detected using this tech nique . 
Fecal samples were generally collected from freshly voided material within the stall of each study horse , rather than per rectum . 
It is possible that contamination of samples by the stall environment ( known to contain considerable amounts of Salmonella DNA ) 1 occurred before the samples were collected . 
It has recently been suggested that the PCR for Sal-monella DNA detection in equine feces is less accurate than initially thought .5,12 By the use of primers that amplify either a region spanning the invasin E and A ( invE-A ) genes of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi-murium or a region of the histidine transport J ( hisJ ) gene , the overall accuracy was estimated to be approximately 87 -- 90 % . 
However , speciﬁcity of the PCR using the hisJ primer set was 85.6 % .12 False-positive reactions may have been related to detection of a previously undescribed Salmonella-like bacterium . 
A similar possibility may explain some of the PCR-positive , culture-negative samples observed in this study . 
Infectious disease control procedures were practiced in the VTH during the study period , and no cases of clinical salmonellosis were diagnosed . 
Nosocomial infections have been deﬁned in human hospitals as those occurring 2 days or more after admission .11 Salmonella spp . 
were isolated from 8 of the 11 horses 2 days or more after admission . 
The serotypes isolated from these horses were bovis-morbiﬁcans , muenster ( 2 ) , mbandaka ( 2 ) , and typhimurium ( 4 ) . 
Previously , the most commonly ( 13 out of 24 ) isolated serotypes at this VTH were newport and typhimurium .29 The progressive increase in the proportion of PCR-positive samples throughout hospitalization could represent nosocomial infection . 
Alternatively , all culture-posi-tive horses may have been infected ( but not necessarily detected ) with Salmonella when admitted . 
These patients may have begun shedding Salmonella in their feces as a result of the stress of hospitalization and its effect on the immune system . 
Whether the potential beneﬁts of preventing sal-monellosis outbreaks justiﬁes the additional cost of routinely testing feces by PCR in hospitalized horses is an issue that needs to be considered . 
Although bacterial culture and PCR results on fecal samples from cattle , pigs , horses , and dogs show moderate to high agreement in some studies ,5,10,18 agreement was poor in this study . 
Reasons why some fecal samples , from which Salmonella organisms can not be isolated , are PCR positive need to be determined before the PCR can be incorporated into Salmonella surveillance programs for hospitalized equine populations .
