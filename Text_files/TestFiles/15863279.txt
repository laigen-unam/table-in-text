Abstract 
The development of the carrier state in swine after infection with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) has not been elucidated yet . 
Possibly , phagocytes like macrophages play a crucial role . 
It was the aim of the present study to characterize the interaction of a S. Typhimurium strain and its hilA and ssrA mutants with porcine peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) . 
Exposure of porcine PBM to S. Typhimurium induced the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , requiring bacterial protein synthesis . 
The numbers of intracellular bacteria sharply decreased over a period of 3 h. Monocytes obtained from different pigs differed markedly in their ROS production and in their ability to kill the bacteria . 
Interestingly , high ROS production did not coincide with increased intracellular killing . 
Using diphenylene iodonium inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase activity , it was shown that bacterial killing was ROS-dependent only within 1 h post inoculation , but was ROS-independent from 1 h post inoculation onwards . 
This might be explained by the ﬁnding that metabolically active Salmonella bacteria were capable of suppressing the respiratory burst activity in a SPI-1 - and SPI-2-independent manner without causing measurable cell damage . 
Opsonization with complement did not alter the ROS production . 
Nevertheless , it increased intracellular survival of the bacteria . 
In conclusion , survival of S. Typhimurium inside porcine PBM is promoted by suppression of respiratory burst activity and complement binding .

1. Introduction
Salmonellosis is one of the most important foodborne zoonoses . 
Serovar Typhimurium accounts for nearly one-quarter of the human salmonellosis cases , and the main source of these infections is pork ( Ducoffre , 2003 ) . 
After infection with Salmonella Typhimurium , pigs often develop a carrier state , excreting the bacteria for up to 28 weeks without showing clinical signs ( Wood et al. , 1989 ) . 
The carrier pig plays a major role as a source of contamination of the environment , other animals and carcasses in the slaughterhouse . 
The mechanism of this carrier state is poorly understood but is associated with survival of Salmonella bacteria inside host macrophages ( Buchmeier and Heffron , 1989 ; Fields et al. , 1986 ; Leung and Finlay , 1991 ) . 
Most of our recent knowledge about interactions of Salmonella with the host is derived from experiments in mice . 
In mice , invasion of host cells is mediated by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 ( SPI-1 ) - encoded type III secretion system ( TTSS ) ( Galán ,

2001 ; Knodler and Steele-Mortimer , 2003 ) . 
This system is induced extracellularly and is essential for invasion of non-phagocytic cells . 
The TTSS enables bacteria to inject effector proteins into the cytosol of the host cells ( Galán , 2001 ; Knodler and SteeleMortimer , 2003 ) . 
After invasion of the intestinal mucosa , Salmonella bacteria are able to induce their own uptake by macrophages ( Alpuche-Aranda et al. , 1994 ) . 
The macrophage tries to kill the bacteria through oxygen-dependent and - independent killing mechanisms . 
Oxygen-dependent mechanisms include the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and reactive nitrogen intermediates ( RNI ) ( Buchmeier et al. , 1993 ; Mastroeni et al. , 2000 ; Vazquez-Torres et al. , 2000a ) . 
However , Salmonella is capable to circumvent oxidative killing by inhibiting the migration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
( NADPH ) oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) towards the Salmonella-containing vacuole , which hinders the delivery of ROS and RNI ( Knodler and Steele-Mortimer , 2003 ; Vazquez-Torres et al. , 2000b ) . 
Two periplasmic enzymes , CuZn superoxide dismutase ( CuZnSOD ) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase also play a role in protecting Salmo-nella bacteria from ROS ( Canvin et al. , 1996 ; De Groote et al. , 1997 ; Lundberg et al. , 1999 ) . 
Oxygen-independent killing includes the production of degradative enzymes and defensins and acidiﬁcation of the phagolysosome ( Groisman et al. , 1992 ) . 
Despite this battery of defense mechanisms , Salmonella is able to survive and even replicate in macrophage phagosomes through a second , SPI-2-encoded TTSS ( Hensel , 2000 ; Knodler and Steele-Mortimer , 2003 ) . 
This is a way to escape from the host immune defense and to contribute to persistence inside the host immune system ( Barrow et al. , 1994 ; Buchmeier and Heffron , 1989 ; Dunlap et al. , 1991 ; Fields et al. , 1986 ; Finlay and Falkow , 1989 ; Leung and Finlay , 1991 ; Vladoianu et al. , 1990 ) . 
Invaded macrophages undergo cell death in a way sharing features of both apoptosis and necrosis ( Brennan and Cookson , 2000 ; Chen et al. , 1996 ; Lindgren et al. , 1996 ; Van der Velden et al. , 2000 ; Watson et al. , 2000 ; Zhou et al. , 2000 ) . 
Interactions of S. Typhimurium with mononuclear phagocytes have been studied mainly in mice and such studies with porcine mononuclear cells ( MNC ) are scarce ( Riber and Lind , 1999 ) . 
Since the course of a S. 
Typhimurium infection in pigs clearly differs from that in BALB/c mice , extrapolation of results obtained in a mouse model to pigs should be made with caution . 
In BALB/c mice , S. Typhimurium causes a septicae-mic , typhoid-like disease , whereas in pigs and a wide range of other hosts , including humans , it causes predominantly gastrointestinal illness . 
The aim of this study was to gain insights in the interactions of S. Typhimurium with peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) of pigs with emphasis on the effect of Salmonella on the monocytic respiratory burst . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
A total of 12 hybrids ( Fomeva B.V. , Meijel , Netherlands ) , 16 - to 24-week-old pigs that were negative for Salmonella at fecal sampling , were used as blood donors . 
Blood was taken once a week between 08:00 and 08:30 a.m. to minimize the effect of diurnal rythm on respiratory burst activity of peripheral blood monocytes . 
The experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of veterinary medicine , Ghent University . 
2.2. Bacteria
Salmonella serovar Typhimurium strain 112910a , isolated from a pig without clinical signs o salmonellosis , was used in all the experiments . 
The bacteria were stored at 70 8C . 
Deletion mutants in the SPI-1 regulator hilA and the SPI-2 regulator ssrA respectively were constructed by one-step inactivation using linear PCR products , mediated by the Red recombinase of bacteriophage lambda ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
In case of the ssrA gene , primers were based on the nucleotide sequence with accession number AE008761 . 
These primers ssrA-P1 50-tagtgatcaagtgc-caaagattttgcaacaggcaactggagggaagcatttgtgtaggctg - gagctgctt-30 ( primer homologous with sequence upstream of ATG startcodon ) and ssrA-P2 50-aagatcttatattctttcattttgctgccctcgcgaaaattaagataa - tacatatgaatatcctccttag-30 ( primer homologous with sequence downstream of stopcodon ) , and plasmid pKD4 DNA were utilized to amplify the linear fragment that was used for the substitution of the gene . 
In case of the hilA gene , primers were designed using the nucleotide sequence with accession number AE006468 . 
To amplify the linear fragment , used for the substitution of the gene , primers hilA-P1 50-ttgtattagttattataacttttcaccctgtaagagaatacactattatctgt - gtaggctggagctgcttc-30 ( primer homologous with sequence upstream of ATG startcodon ) and hilA-P2 50-caaccagattacgatgataaaaaaataatgcatatctcctctctca-gattcatatgaatatcctccttag-30 ( primer homologous with sequence downstream of stopcodon ) , and the template plasmid pKD4 were used . 
The helper plasmid pKD46 , encoding the Red recombinase , was introduced into Salmonella serovar Typhimurium strain 112910a by electroporation , followed by selection on LB medium ( 10 g/l tryptone , 5 g/l yeast extract , 10 g/l NaCl ) supplemented with 
100 mg/l carbenicillin . 
By electroporation of competent 112910a ( pKD46 ) cells , cultured in presence of 0.2 % arabinose , with the respective linear PCR fragments and selection on LB medium containing 25 mg/l kanamycin , substitutions of the ssrA and hilA genes by a kanamycin resistance gene surrounded by FRT sites were obtained . 
These substitutions were transduced in a fresh wild-type background using bacteriophage P22HTint ( Schmieger and Backhaus , 1976 ) . 
After the elimination of the antibiotic resistance marker from the transductants , using the temperature sensitive helper plasmid pCP20 encoding the FLP recombinase , the hilA and ssrA genes are deleted from the start codon till the stop codon and a scar consisting of one FRT site and the priming sites P1 and P2 is left . 
This was conﬁrmed by sequencing the relevant PCR fragments . 
For the in vitro assays , the bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion broth ( BHI , Oxoid Ltd. , Hampshire , UK ) for 6 h at 37 8C . 
The bacteria were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , 2000 g for 10 min at 4 8C ) . 
After a third wash with sterile Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) with Ca/Mg ( Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) , the bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of HBSS with Ca/Mg . 
The number of viable microorganisms was determined by plating 10-fold dilutions on Brilliant Green Agar ( BGA , Basingstoke , UK ) . 
For use in the chemiluminescence ( CL ) assay , Salmonella bacteria were either used untreated , opsonized , UV - or acetone-inactivated or chloram-phenicol-treated . 
Viable Salmonella bacteria were opsonized with guinea pig complement ( Virion Ltd. , Rüschlikon , Switzerland ) by incubating an equal volume of complement and bacterial suspension for 30 min at 20 8C . 
For UV inactivation , the bacteria were placed under an UV lamp ( Philips Ultra-violet , TUV 15 W/G15T18 ) at 15 cm distance in sterile Petri dishes during 1 h . 
The suspension was plated on Columbia blood agar ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) to conﬁrm the inactivation . 
Acetone-inactivated S. Typhimurium were obtained by suspending in 100 % acetone during 15 min at 18 8C and subsequent lyophilisation . 
Treatment with chloramphenicol was performed by incubation with 25 mg/ml chloramphe-nicol during 1 h at 4 8C . 
2.3 . 
Isolation of porcine peripheral blood monocytes 
For the collection of monocytes from peripheral blood , 120 ml of blood was taken from the jugular vein in syringes with heparine ( 150 IU/ml , Leo , Zaventem , Belgium ) . 
The blood was diluted 1/1 with PBS , pH 7.3 at 4 8C . 
To separate the mononuclear cells , 20 ml of diluted blood were carefully layered on Ficoll-Paque Plus ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 45 min at 18 8C . 
After recovering the MNC from the interface between plasma and the Ficoll-Paque , the cells were washed with PBS ( 550 g for 10 min at 4 8C ) . 
The remaining erythrocytes , which could act as quenchers and active scavengers of ROS , were lyse by incubating the cells in hypotonic ﬂuid ( 450 ml of NH4Cl 0.83 % in aqua dest and 50 ml Tris 2.06 % in aqua dest , pH 7.65 ) for 10 min at 4 8C . 
After washing with PBS , the MNC were resupended in medium ( A ) , based on RPMI-1640 without L-glutamine ( Gibco BRL , Life Technologies Inc. , Gaithersburg , USA ) and supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Integro B.V. , Dieren , The Netherlands ) , 0.3 mg/ml L-glutamine , 1 mM Na-pyruvate , 1 % non-essential amino acids , 10 U/ml heparin , 100 U/ml penicillin , 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.1 mg/ml kanamycin ( Gibco BRL ) . 
Subsequently , the MNC suspension was incubated in culture ﬂasks of 182-cm ( Greiner Bio-2 one GmbH , Frickenhausen , Germany ) at 2 10 6 cells/ml overnight at 37 8C with 5 % CO2 . 
After incubation , non-adherent lymphocytes were removed by washing with HBSS with Ca/Mg at 37 8C . 
The 
PBM were harvested by adding 5 ml of versenate , based on 100 ml of trypsin diluent ( NaCl 8 g/l , KCl 0.2 g/l , KH2PO4 0.12 g/l , Na2HPO4 0.91 g/l , phenol red 0.5 % ) and 2 g of EDTA . 
Purity of the PBM was estimated by ﬂow-cytometry . 
Brieﬂy , 1 10 cells / 6 tube were indirectly labelled by incubation in 1/1000 74.22.15 anti-SWC3 mouse monoclonal antibody and 2 % g-globulin-free horse serum ( Gibco BRL ) for 1 h at 4 8C . 
SWC3 is deﬁned as a speciﬁc myelomonocytic antigen of 230 kDa . 
Its N-terminal sequence revealed homology with members of the signal regulatory protein family ( Alvarez et al. , 2000 ; Pescovitz et al. , 1984 ; Thacker et al. , 2001 ) . 
After washing with PBS at 4 8C , the cells were resuspended in 200 ml of a 1/100 dilution of FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , USA ) and 2 % g-globulin-free horse serum and incubated for 1 h at 4 8C . 
Three thousand cells , gated using forward scatter and side scatter on monocytes , were analysed using a FACScalibur ﬂow-cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , California ) and CELL-Quest software . 
2.4. Determination of ROS production by porcine monocytes exposed to S. Typhimurium
Reactive oxygen species production was measured using the chemiluminescence technique . 
The CL assays were performed in sterile 96-well plates with clear bottom ( Greiner Bio-one GmbH , Frickenhausen , Germany ) at 37 8C in a microplate luminometer 
( Fluoroscan Ascent Fl , Thermo Labsystems , Helsinki , Finland ) . 
Luminol ( Sigma Biosciences , St. Louis , USA ) was applied as chemiluminigenic probe . 
The stock solution of luminol consisted of 104 mM luminol in dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO , Sigma Bios-ciences , St. Louis , USA ) and was stored in small aliquots at 70 8C . 
The ﬁnal assay concentration was 200 mM . 
The chemiluminescent response of porcine PBM stimulated with different triggering agents , was compared to the response obtained after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma Biosciences , St. Louis , USA ) . 
The PMA stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of PMA in 1 ml of ethanol and stored in small aliquots at 20 8C . 
Prior to use , the stock solution was further diluted in HBSS with Ca/Mg to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mg/ml . 
PBM were seeded in a 96-well plate at 10 cells/well in 100 ml of RPMI . 
RPMI - and PBM-6 free wells with S. Typhimurium were used as controls . 
Spontaneous CL ( PBM without triggering agents ) was recorded for 10 min . 
The CL reaction was started by adding 50 ml/well of the bacterial suspensions at 10 bacteria/monocyte and the production of ROS was measured during 1 h . 
At 60 min after this primary stimulus , the residual oxidative activity was determined by adding 25 ml of PMA at 20 mg/ml ﬁnal concentration and measuring the CL response for 60 min . 
The CL response is expressed as relative light units/min ( RLU ) . 
The chemiluminescent response of porcine PBM was measured after exposure to the following triggering agents : the native S. Typhimurium strains : wild-type , hilA and ssrA mutant , opsonized S. Typhimurium ; UV or acetone-inactivated S. Typhi-murium ; chloramphenicol-treated bacteria . 
The experiments with the mutants were performed on PBM of four pigs ( pigs 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) , and each experiment was performed in triplicate . 
For the experiments with opsonized S. Typhimurium , UV-or acetone-inactivated S. Typhimurium or chloram-phenicol-treated bacteria , the PBM of four pigs ( pigs 
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) were used . 
All measurements were performed in triplicate , and each experiment was carried out three times . 
In order to suppress ROS production by the porcine PBM , the NAD ( P ) H oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneio-donium ( DPI ) was added to one-half of the wells at ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM ( Li and Trush , 1998 ; Tan and Berridge , 2000 ) . 
After 30 min of incubation at 37 8C , PBM were inoculated with S. Typhimurium , and the CL response was measured . 
Peripheral blood monocytes of three pigs ( pigs 9 , 10 , 11 ) were used , and each experiment was performed in triplicate . 
2.5. Cytotoxic effects of S. Typhimurium on porcine PBM
The lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) cytotoxicity detection kit ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) was applied to determine cytotoxic effects of S. Typhimurium on PBM . 
This kit is a colorimetric assay for the quantiﬁcation of cell death and cell lysis , based on the measurement of LDH activity released from the cytosol of damaged PBM ( Zychlinsky et al. , 1994 ) . 
Cells were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate at 10 PBM/well in 100 ml of RPMI without phenol 5 red . 
The cells were inoculated with viable S. Typhimurium bacteria at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 or 100 in 100 ml of RPMI without phenol red . 
Monocytes lysed with 2 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma -- Aldrich , St. Louis , USA ) in 100 ml of RPMI served as positive control . 
Non-inoculated PBM and S. Typhi-murium bacteria at 10 or 10 cfu/well without PBM 6 7 served as negative controls . 
RPMI was used to measure background signals . 
The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 8C . 
After centrifugation ( 250 g for 10 min at 4 8C ) , 100 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate . 
The LDH cytotoxicity assay was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
After dilution of the supernatant ( 1/5 and 1/25 ) , 100 ml of the reaction mixture of the kit was added . 
The plate was incubated during 30 min at room temperature protected from light . 
The optical density ( OD ) was measured at 492 nm . 
Percent cytotoxicity was calculated using the formula : 
% cytoxicity 100 ðODc ODc OD 2 1 PBMÞ In this formula , ODi = OD of the supernatant after exposure of PBM to S. Typhimurium during 2 h ; ODc = OD of the supernatant of S. Typhimurium 1 suspended in RPMI without phenol red ; ODc = OD 2 of the supernatant of PBM lysed with 2 % Triton X-100 ; ODPBM = OD of the supernatant of PBM incubated in medium without bacteria during 2 h . 
The experiment was carried out on the PBM of four pigs ( pigs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . 
All measurements were performed in triplicate , and each experiment was carried out three times . 
2.6. Determination of number of intracellular S. Typhimurium bacteria inside porcine monocytes
For the determination of intracellular killing of S. Typhimurium by the PBM , PBM were collected and seeded at 10 cells/well as described above . 
The cells 6 were inoculated with viable S. Typhimurium or viable , complement opsonized S. Typhimurium at an MOI of 10 . 
The plates were centrifuged ( 365 g for 10 min at 37 8C ) , to facilitate contact between bacteria and PBM . 
After incubation during 30 min at 37 8C with 5 % CO2 , the cells were washed three times with HBSS with Ca / Mg at 37 8C . 
Gentamicin ( 100 ml/well , 50 mg/ml RPMI without phenol red ) was used to kill extracellular bacteria . 
The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 8C with 5 % CO2 , and consequently , the medium was replaced by RPMI without phenol red supplemented with 10 mg/ml gentamicin . 
At 1 or 3 h post inoculation , the PBM were washed three times with HBSS with Ca / Mg at 37 8C to remove gentamicin , lysed with 0.5 % 
Triton X-100 , and the number of intracellular bacteria was determined by plating 10-fold dilutions on BGA plates . 
Comparing bactericidal indexes ( BI = log ( 10 ) cfu of viable intracellular salmonellae at t = 3 h after inoculation/log ( 10 ) cfu of viable intracellular salmonellae at t = 1 h ) of PBM inoculated with native S. Typhimurium and opsonized S. Typhimurium was performed using a paired t-test . 
A P-value of < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant . 
Peripheral blood monocytes of four pigs ( pigs 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) were used . 
All measurements were performed in triplicate , and each experiment was carried out twice . 
For the determination of ROS-dependent killing of S. Typhimurium by porcine PBM , DPI was added as described above . 
Peripheral blood monocytes of three pigs ( pigs 9 , 10 , 11 ) were used , and each experiment was performed in triplicate . 
Comparing numbers of intracellular S. Typhimurium in PBM treated with DPI and in non-treated PBM was performed using a paired t-test . 
A P-value of < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant 
1/4 1 ðODi ODc ODPBMÞ 
Production of RNI was measured using the Griess reaction . 
Therefore , 10 PBM were put in wells of a 6 96-well tissue culture plate in 100 ml of medium ( A ) and incubated overnight at 37 8C with 5 % CO2 to allow adherence . 
The cells were washed three times with HBSS with Ca/Mg at 37 8C and exposed to S. Typhimurium at a ratio of 10 bacteria/cell ( MOI 10 ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) of S. Enteritidis ( 1 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml ) ( Sigma , St. Louis , USA ) in 100 ml of HBSS . 
Wells containing non-inoculated PBM and wells containing 10 cfu S. Typhimurium without 7 PBM were used as negative controls . 
The culture plates were centrifuged at 365 g for 10 min at 37 8C to facilitate contact between bacteria and PBM and to synchronise infection . 
After 30 min incubation at 37 8C with 5 % CO2 , to allow uptake of S. Typhimurium , the cells were washed three times with HBSS with Ca/Mg at 37 8C . 
Gentamicin ( 50 mg/ml ) was added for 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . 
Subsequently the medium was replaced by 100 ml of RPMI without phenol red containing 10 mg/ml gentamicin and 1 % L-arginine . 
This was considered as time point zero . 
The supernatant was collected at 24 h post inoculation . 
One hundred microlitres of the supernatant was put in a 96-well plate , and the Griess reagents ( Rosco , Brussels ) were added ( 50 ml of sulfanilic acid 0.8 % and 50 ml of N-N-dimethyl-a-naphtyl-amine 0.6 % ) . 
The optical density ( OD ) was measured at 550 nm . 
The experiment was carried out on the PBM of four pigs ( pigs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . 
All measurements were performed in triplicate , and each experiment was repeated twice .

There were no signiﬁcant differences ( paired t-test , P < 0.05 ) in ROS production by PBM after stimulation with non-treated or opsonized salmonellae . 
At 1 h after inoculation , there were no signiﬁcant differences in intracellular bacteria between nontreated salmonellae or opsonized salmonellae . 
Within

SsrA and HilA do not inﬂuence respiratory burst activity of porcine monocytes 
The results of the ROS production of the PBM inoculated with the hilA and the ssrA mutant are illustrated in Table 1 . 
In the CL assay , PBM stimulated with the hilA and the ssrA mutant showed a low residual oxygenation activity , just like the wild-type Salmonella . 
There were no signiﬁcant differences ( paired t-test , P < 0.05 ) in ROS production by PBM after stimulation with the hilA and ssrA deletion mutant and the wild-type strain .

4. Discussion
0.17 0.17 0.34
Exposure of porcine PBM to viable salmonellae resulted in the induction of ROS production . 
One way for Salmonella to circumvent these oxygen radicals is to actively suppress the respiratory burst of the PBM . 
At 60 min post inoculation of PBM with Salmonella , the residual oxidative activity of the porcine cells was very low . 
This indicates that the S. Typhimurium strain used in our experiments , is able to suppress the production of ROS in porcine PBM . 
The mechanism of this suppression is not clear but requires viable bacteria with bacterial protein synthesis and is SPI-1-and SPI-2-independent . 
The LDH test revealed no monocyte cytotoxicity at 2 h post inoculation in contrast to the situation in mice ( Van der Velden et al. , 2000 ) , indicating that suppression of ROS production by porcine PBM was not associated with cell damage . 
Addition of DPI resulted in abolishment of ROS production by PBM . 
The higher number of viable intracellular bacteria at 1 h post inoculation after DPI treatment suggests that ROS are necessary for rapid killing of S. Typhimurium by PBM the ﬁrst hour after inoculation . 
The contribution of ROS to the innate immunity against Salmonella has also been demonstrated in mice ( Vazquez-Torres et al. , 2000a ; VazquezTorres and Fang , 2001 ) . 
Between 1 and 3 h post inoculation , bacterial killing was not decreased in DPI-treated cells . 
These results suggest that ROS associated killing of Salmonella bacteria occurs only shortly after contact . 
Afterwards , NADPH oxidase-independent mechanisms appear to be responsible of bacterial killing . 
This ﬁnding is in agreement with the observed respiratory burst suppression by the bacteria . 
Earlier work on CL activity of porcine PBM revealed that individual pigs differ in ROS production by monocytes after inoculation with S. Typhimurium ( Riber and Lind , 1999 ) . 
In our experiments , individual differences between pigs were noticed both in the production of ROS and in the ability to kill Salmonella between 1 and 3 h post inoculation of the PBM . 
These individual differences in killing activity by PBM might play a role in the development of the carrier state in some pigs and not in others . 
In this study , a high ROS production corresponded to limited intracellular kill-ing of S. Typhimurium by PBM and vice versa . 
This ﬁnding suggests that the amount of ROS produced might be a measure for the killing capacity of the porcine PBM , but further experiments are required . 
In contrast to the ﬁndings of Riber and Lind ( 1999 ) , the number of intracellular bacteria steadily decreased over the ﬁrst 3 h period , suggesting lack of intracel lular bacterial multiplication . 
Interestingly , numbers of intracellular salmonellae decreased signiﬁcantly less when the bacteria were opsonized with complement . 
The importance of different complement receptors in the interactions of Salmonella with macrophages has been suggested by Ishibashi and Arai ( 1996 ) . 
Possibly , intracellular trafﬁcking , and thus , survival of the Salmonella bacteria might be inﬂuenced by entry in the host cell through complement receptor binding . 
No RNI production was detected by porcine PBM after stimulation with S. Typhimurium or LPS . 
This is in agreement with studies performed by Pampusch et al. ( 1998 ) who suggested that NO synthase ( iNOS ) is not inducible in porcine immune cells with little or no upregulation following stimulation . 
Therefore , in contrast to the situation in mice ( Mastroeni et al. , 
3.7 . 
RNI production by porcine PBM after inoculation with S. Typhimurium 
2000 ; Vazquez-Torres et al. , 2000a ) , RNI production by iNOS does not appear to be an important component of the innate immune response to control intracellular Salmonella populations in pigs .
