INTRODUCTION 
Salmonella spp. , and other Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria , have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to infect and colonize their hosts . 
One such mechanism is termed the virulence-associated type III secretion system ( T3SS ) , which is composed of specialized organelles that deliver bacterial proteins ( effectors ) directly into the host-cell cytoplasm ( Cornelis & Van Gijsegem , 2000 ; Galán & Collmer , 1999 ; Hueck , 1998 ; Kimbrough & Miller , 2002 ; Ramamurthi & Schneewind , 2005 ) . 
The T3SS is composed of a basal body that crosses both bacterial membranes , and an external needle through which effector proteins are secreted ( Blocker et al. , 2001 ; Hueck , 1998 ; Kimbrough & Miller , 2002 ) . 
Various studies have shown that the Salmonella invasion proteins ( Sips ) encoded by the T3SS genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) are central to initiation of the entry process . 
For example , individual non-polar sipB /

sipC/sipD deletion mutants have been found to be entrydeficient , due to their inability to deliver other effectors into cultured mammalian cells ( Collazo & Galan , 1997 ) . 
The effector proteins SipB and SipC form an extracellular complex following their secretion through the SPI-1 T3SS , and they are thought to assemble into a plasma membrane-integral structure ( translocon ) that mediates effector delivery ( Hayward & Koronakis , 1999 ; Scherer et al. , 2000 ) . 
The IpaB and IpaC proteins in Shigella flexneri , BipB and BipD in Burkholderia pseudomallei , YopB and YopD in Yersinia enterocolitica , EspB and EspD in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) , BopB and BopD in Bordetella bronchiseptica , and PopB and PopD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are thought to be homologous components of the translocation apparatus formed by SipB and SipC in Salmonella . 
All of these secreted proteins have been shown to be delivered to the host-cell membrane , where they form pore complexes ( Daniell et al. , 2001 ; Davis et al. , 1998 ; Hayward et al. , 2000 ; Ide et al. , 2001 ; Kuwae et al. , 2003 ; Neyt & Cornelis , 1999 ; Nogawa et al. , 2004 ; Scherer et al. , 2000 ; Suparak et al. , 2005 ; Faudry et al. , 2006 ; Johnson et al. 2006 ) . 
In addition to its role as a translocon , SipB can also reportedly be phagocytized by macrophages and subsequently translocated via SPI-1 T3SS into the cytoplasm of the macrophage , where it induces apoptosis of the host cell by associating with the proapoptotic protease caspase-1 ( Hersh et al. , 1999 ) . 
2007/011528 G 2008 SGM 
It has been reported that Shigella IpaB , a homologue of SipB , is associated with the bacterial envelope ( Menard et al. , 1994 ; Mills et al. , 1988 ; Watarai et al. , 1995 ) and can be localized to the Shigella cell surface in the presence of T3SS ( Olive et al. , 2007 ) . 
Recently , Johnson et al. ( 2006 ) have shown that surface localization of IpaB is dependent on the presence of IpaD . 
Veenendaal et al. ( 2007 ) have also suggested that the interaction between IpaB and IpaD at the needle tip is a key to host-cell sensing , and allows insertion of the translocation pore into the host-cell membrane . 
Interestingly , Hayward et al. ( 2000 ) have shown that Salmonella SipB can also be localized to the cell surface of bacteria during invasion of mammalian target cells , and furthermore that the protein fractionated with outer-membrane proteins . 
However , other evidence on SipB localization is conflicting . 
SipB can be detected ( 1 ) in the culture medium , ( 2 ) associated with the bacterial outer membrane , and ( 3 ) inserted into the target-cell plasma membrane ( Hayward & Koronakis , 1999 ; Hayward et al. , 2000 ; Kubori & Galan , 2002 ; Scherer et al. , 2000 ) . 
Here , we confirmed that wild-type SipB protein could be localized on the surface of Salmonella , and showed the essential domain of SipB for mediating outer-membrane localization . 
METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
Bacterial strains and their genotypes are listed in Table 1 . 
Strains were grown on L-agar or in L-broth supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl to allow optimal expression of the components of the invasion-associated T3SS . 
When required , the following antibiotics were added at the indicated concentrations : kanamycin , 50 mg ml ; ampicillin , 100 mg ml ; 21 21 streptomycin , 100 mg ml ; tetracycline , 10 mg ml . 
21 21 
Genetic techniques . 
DNA cloning was carried out using the method described elsewhere ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
Restriction enzymes , T4 ligase and Taq polymerase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim or Takara . 
General transduction was performed with P22 HT105/int , and non-lysogenic segregants were identified by sensitivity to P22 H5 ( Davis et al. , 1980 ) . 
Bacterial mutant strains ( DsipB and DsipD ) were constructed by the lRed recombinase method ( Datsenko & Wanner , 2000 ) . 
Plasmid construction . 
All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
For expression of the 140 aa SipB and its derivatives , we used plasmid pSSV160 ( Kim et al. 2007 ) as a template . 
To construct pSSV140 , the region encoding the N-terminal 140 aa of SipB was amplified using appropriate primers ( forward primer PlacL , 59-ccgactagtaatacgcaaaccgcctct-39 ; reverse primer Sip140R , 59-ccgggtacc-gagatccgtcgcctcct-39 ) . 
The underlined sequences indicate the restriction enzyme sites for SpeI and KpnI , respectively . 
The amplified fragments ( Plac and SipB 140 aa ) were digested with SpeI and KpnI , and then ligated with T4 ligase ( Takara ) to pSSV160 , which had been pre-digested with SpeI and KpnI and eluted . 
The same strategy was used to construct plasmids pSSV120 ( SipB1 -- 120-LLO-M45 ) , pSSV100 ( SipB1 -- 100-LLO-M45 ) , pSSV72 ( SipB1 -- 72-LLO-M45 ) , pSSV30 
( SipB1 -- 30-LLO-M45 ) , pSSV15 ( SipB1 -- 15-LLO-M45 ) , pSSV8 ( SipB1 -- 8-LLO-M45 ) and pSSV1 ( SipB1-LLO-M45 ) ( see Table 2 ) . 
To construct pSSVD2-30 , the region encoding the N-terminal 31 -- 160 aa of SipB was amplified as a template pSSV160 using appropriate primers ( forward primer SipB31F , 59-ccggatatcatgacggactttttaaaagcggcg-39 ; reverse pri-mer Sip160R , 59-ccgggtaccttacgcagcgtcataaacact-39 ) . 
The underlined sequences indicate the restriction enzyme sites for EcoRV and KpnI , respectively . 
The amplified fragments ( SipB 31 -- 160 aa ) were digested with EcoRV and KpnI , and then ligated with T4 ligase ( Takara ) to pSSV160 , which had been pre-digested with EcoRV and KpnI and eluted . 
The DNA sequences of the ligated clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing ( Macrogen ) . 
To construct the template plasmid for the alanine substitution mutant ( pSM ) , we amplified the region encoding the native promoter sicA along with the sipB gene ( forward primer CoSPaS , 59-ggcgtcga-catttcctgaccatgaaagatatg-39 ; reverse primer SipB593R , 59-ggcgagctcgc-gactctggcgcagaataa-39 ) using the Salmonella chromosome as template . 
The underlined sequences indicate restriction enzyme sites for SalI and SacI , respectively . 
The amplified fragments ( Pnative , SicA and SipB 593 aa ) were digested with SalI and SacI , and ligated into pMW118 plasmids pre-cut with SalI and SacI . 
To construct the alanine substitution mutants , site-directed mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . 
Briefly , complementary oligonucleotides were designed to include the desired codon change to alanine ( see Table 2 ) . 
Plasmid pSM was used as template , and the resulting mutagenized PCR products were digested with DpnI and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells . 
Plasmids obtained from these transformed colonies were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation ( Macrogen ) . 
Preparation of culture supernatant proteins and Western blotting . 
For preparation of culture supernatant proteins , bacterial supernatants ( 10 ml ) were passed through a 0.45 mm pore-size syringe filter in order to remove the bacteria . 
The proteins present in the bacteria-free medium were precipitated to 10 % ( v/v ) by the addition of cold TCA followed by incubation on ice for 2 h . 
The proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4 uC . 
The resulting pellets were washed in 0.8 ml cold acetone , dried , and resuspended in PBS buffered with 80 mM Tris/HCl , pH 8.0 . 
Samples corresponding to 100 ml whole bacterial culture or 200 ml culture supernatant were separated by 12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . 
Wild-type SipB , truncated SipB or reporter-fused SipB proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis . 
Western blots were treated with a mAb against the M45 tag ( a kind gift from P. Hearing , State University of New York , Stony Brook , NY ) or a polyclonal anti-SipB antibody ( Kim et al. , 2007 ) separately , followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidaselabelled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies , respectively . 
The blots were developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit ( Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent ) . 
Salmonella subcellular fractionation . 
The outer-membrane fraction was prepared by a modification of the lysozyme -- osmotic shock method ( Osborn & Munson , 1974 ) . 
Cultures were grown in LB broth to OD600 0.9 and then centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min , and supernatants were saved for analysis of secreted proteins . 
The cell pellets were resuspended in 800 ml 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer ( pH 8.6 ) containing 500 mM sucrose and 0.5 mM EDTA . 
Hen egg white lysozyme ( 40 ml of a 4 mg ml stock solution ) was added , followed 21 immediately by the addition of 3.2 ml 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer ( pH 8.6 ) containing 250 mM sucrose , 0.25 mM EDTA and 2.5 mM MgCl2 . 
After gentle agitation , the suspension was incubated for 15 min on an ice bath . 
The resulting pellet was resuspended in 4 ml 20 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 8.6 ) , disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell ( 82 800 kPa ; American Instrument Company ) and centrifuged at 7000 g for 6 min at 4 uC in order to remove unbroken cells . 
The supernatant was then centrifuged at 132 000 g for 1 h at 4 uC to separate the soluble fraction and insoluble cell envelopes . 
The soluble fraction was taken as containing the cytoplasmic proteins . 
For isolation of the outer-membrane fraction , total envelope pellets were suspended in 4 ml 20 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 8.6 ) containing 1 % Sarkosyl and incubated for 30 min on ice . 
The outer-membrane fraction was obtained as a pellet after centrifugation at 132 000 g for 1 h at 4 uC . 
The pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer ( pH 8.6 ) . 
The original culture supernatant was filtered ( 0.22 mm pore-size filter ) , and precipitated with 10 % TCA ( 2 h , 4 uC ) . 
Each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis . 
Separation of inner - and outer-membrane fractions by sucrose gradient . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) stationary-phase cultures were diluted 1 : 20 into LB medium , and incubated to OD600 0.9 under type III secretion induction conditions ( 0.3 M NaCl ) with mild aeration . 
Cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 8000 g , 10 min ) , resuspended in 0.03 culture volumes of 20 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 7.4 ) containing 1 mM PMSF , and disrupted in a French press ( 82 800 kPa , American Instrument Company ) . 
The lysate was clarified ( 8000 g , 10 min , 4 uC ) and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again ( 132 000 g , 1 h , 4 uC ) to separate the soluble cytosolic proteins ( supernatant ) from the whole membranes ( pellet ) . 
Isolated whole membranes were resuspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 8.6 ) containing 5 mM EDTA and layered onto a six-step sucrose gradient ( 1.0 -- 2.0 M sucrose , 5 mM EDTA ) . 
The gradient was centrifuged ( 100 000 g , 36 h , 4 uC ) and fractionated into 14 fractions , and the proteins from each fraction were precipitated with 10 % ( v/v ) TCA and analysed by immunoblotting .

RESULTS
SipB could be localized on the surface of S. typhimurium
Previous studies have suggested that SipB can be detected on the surface of wild-type Salmonella strains ( Collazo &

Galan , 1996 ) , particularly during invasion of mammalian target cells , when it may be fractionated with outermembrane proteins ( Hayward et al. , 2000 ) . 
It has been also reported that Shigella IpaB , a homologue of Salmonella SipB , may be associated with the bacterial surface ( Menard et al. , 1994 ; Mills et al. , 1988 ; Watarai et al. , 1995 ; Veenendaal et al. , 2007 ) . 
Therefore , we first sought to confirm that SipB protein was present on the bacterial outer membrane . 
Wild-type and sipB deletion mutants were cultured under SPI-1-inducing conditions ( 0.3 M NaCl ) , and total cell membranes were isolated and fractionated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation . 
Consistent with earlier observations ( Collazo & Galan 1996 ; Hayward et al. , 2000 ) , wild-type SipB co-migrated with the bacterial outermembrane marker OmpW ( data not shown ) . 
To further confirm that wild-type SipB could be localized to the Salmonella cell surface , bacterial cells were labelled with a polyclonal anti-SipB antibody , as described in Methods . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( c ) , SipB was successfully localized to the bacterial cell surface . 
The SipB protein crosses both the inner and the outer membrane through the T3SS needle during the translocation process . 
Therefore , it was possible that the outermembrane localization of SipB resulted from random association with cell membranes during the proteinpreparation process . 
To address this possibility , we examined whether the SipB protein was present in outermembrane fractions from an invA mutant Salmonella , which is known to be defective for T3SS ( Galan & Curtiss , 1991 ) . 
Culture supernatants , cell lysates and outermembrane fractions were prepared from the wild-type , sipB and invA strains , and Western blotting of the combined bottom fractions ( fractions 1 -- 6 ; see Fig. 1 legend ) was used to observe the localization of the wildtype SipB proteins . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( a ) , SipB was not secreted to the culture supernatant or detected in outermembrane fractions from the invA strain . 
This supports our contention that the presence of SipB in the outermembrane fractions of wild-type preparations ( Fig. 1b ) was not due to random association with the cell membrane during the preparation process . 
Fig. 1 . 
SipB localization to the bacterial outer membrane requires its secretion and is independent of the presence of SipD . 
( a ) Expression and secretion of SipB protein was detected from whole-cell lysates ( equivalent to 100 ml bacterial culture ) or culture supernatants ( 600 ml ) from wild-type ( lane 1 ) , DsipB ( lane 2 ) , invA : : Km ( lane 3 ) , and DsipD ( lane 4 ) cells . 
Blots were probed with polyclonal anti-SipB160 antibodies , and then reprobed with anti-DnaK mAbs as a control for cytosolic protein contamination ( lower panel ) . 
( b ) Expression and outer-membrane localization of SipB in wild-type ( lane 1 ) , DsipB ( lane 2 ) , invA : : Km ( lane 3 ) and DsipD ( lane 4 ) cells . 
Outer-membrane fractions were prepared by sucrose density-gradient fractionation as described in Methods . 
Since we showed previously the non-specific signal in fraction numbers 7 -- 13 , the bottom fractions ( nos 1 -- 6 ) were pooled and blotted , and the blots were separately probed with polyclonal antiSipB160 , polyclonal anti-OmpW and monoclonal anti-DnaK antibodies . 
OmpW was used as an outer-membrane marker ( middle panel ) and DnaK was used as a control for cytosolic protein contamination ( lower panel ) . 
Asterisks indicate nonspecific signals . 
( c ) SipB localizes to the S. typhimurium surface . 
S. typhimurium wild-type and DsipB mutants were grown in LB broth containing 0.3 M NaCl or 2.5 mM DOC to OD600 ~ 0.9 , fixed , overlaid on gelatin-coated slides ( 0.1 % gelatin , w/v ) , and then stained with polyclonal anti-SipB/AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG . 
Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed SipB expression on the bacterial surface of wild-type cells ( upper panel , right ) but not DsipB mutant cells ( lower panel , right ) . 
The left-hand panels show differential interference contrast ( DIC ) micrographs of the above two strains . 
Recent reports have shown that localization of Shigella IpaB to the bacterial cell surface is dependent on the presence of IpaD , a homologue of Salmonella SipD , and have further shown that interaction of IpaB and IpaD at the needle tip is necessary for their insertion into the hostcell membrane ( Johnson et al. , 2006 ; Veenendaal et al. , 2007 ) . 
Since no earlier study has examined whether outermembrane localization of SipB is dependent on SipD , we prepared culture supernatants , cell lysates and outermembrane fractions from a sipD deletion strain , and examined SipB localization by Western blotting . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( b ) , SipB was detected in the outer-membrane fractions from the sipD deletion strain . 
Collectively , these results indicate that SipB is localized on the Salmonella surface in a SipD-independent manner . 
The N-terminal 160 residues of SipB could direct localization to the bacterial cell surface 
In a recent study , we were able to show that a recombinant protein containing the N-terminal 160 aa of SipB ( SipB160 ) could be successfully secreted into the culture supernatant ( Kim et al. , 2007 ) . 
We next examined whether the same fragment of SipB ( SipB160 ) could direct localization to the outer membrane , by using a recombinant plasmid containing SipB160 protein fused to a Cterminal M45 epitope tag ( pSSV160 ) . 
To investigate whether recombinant SipB160 fusion proteins were displayed on the bacterial surface in a manner similar to that seen for wild-type SipB , immuno-fluorescence microscopic analysis was carried out with a mouse anti-M45 mAb . 
Hoechst 33342 dye was added to the bacterial culture to facilitate cell staining without leakage of the cell envelope , as described in Methods , and stained cells expressing the recombinant protein were probed with an anti-M45 primary mAb followed by an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody . 
As shown in Fig. 2 ( a ) , IFA showed that the M45 molecules were exposed to the cell surface by recombinant proteins harbouring the N-terminal 160 aa of SipB , but not by fusion proteins lacking this fragment . 
To further confirm the surface localization of the recombinant SipB160 , we carried out a proteinase K assay followed by Western blotting with anti-M45 antibody . 
Treatment of the recombinant SipB160-expressing cells with proteinase K resulted in degradation of the recombinant protein ( Fig. 2b , upper panel ) . 
To examine this digestion in more detail , we carried out time-dependent proteinase K treatment ( Fig. 2b , lower panel ) , and found that the recombinant SipB160 protein was partially degraded after 20 min , and completely degraded after 90 min . 
These data confirm that M45 molecules were displayed on the surface of bacteria through localization by SipB160 .

Wildtype S. typhimurium cells containing pSSV1 or pSSV160 were grown in LB broth containing 0.3 M NaCl to OD600 ~ 0.9 , stained with 1.5 g ml '' 1 Hoechst 33342 dye ( blue signal ) , and then incubated with an anti-M45 primary mAb followed by ( Fc-specific ) FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG ( green signal ) . 
( b ) Proteinase K susceptibility assay of recombinant SipB160-LLO-M45 fusion proteins . 
Cells harbouring pSSV1 ( lanes 1 , 3 and 4 ) or pSSV160 ( lanes 2 , 5 and 6 ) were grown in LB broth containing 0.3 M NaCl to OD600 ~ 0.9 , and incubated with ( + ) or without ( -- ) proteinase K ( 200 mg ml '' 1 ) ( upper panel ) . 
Time-dependent susceptibility was assayed with 20 mg proteinase K ml '' 1 ( lower panel ) . 
Outermembrane proteins were prepared from proteinase K-treated ( or untreated ) cells , as described in Methods . 
Recombinant SipB proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-M45 mAbs . 
The N-terminal 100 -- 140 aa of SipB are necessary for its outer-membrane localization 
To further delineate which of the N-terminal 160 aa were responsible for the outer-membrane localization of SipB , outer-membrane fractions , supernatants and cell lysates were prepared from strains expressing various mutant SipB proteins ( pSSV1 , -8 , -15 , -30 ; see Table 1 ) . 
Although all tested strains could secrete M45 ( Fig. 3a ) , only the strain containing parental pSSV160 directed M45 to the outer membrane ( Fig. 3b ) . 
To further clarify the region necessary for localization to the outer membrane , we generated fusion vectors that included the first 72 ( pSSV72 ) , 100 ( pSSV100 ) , 120 ( pSSV120 ) and 140 ( pSSV140 ) N-terminal residues . 
As shown in Fig. 3 ( c ) , pSSV120 and pSSV140 could mediate localization to the outer membrane , but pSSV100 could not , indicating that the fragment between N-terminal amino acids 100 and 140 of SipB was essential to the outer-membrane localization of SipB . 
To examine whether the outer-membrane localization of SipB160 was dependent on its secretion , we used pSSVD2-30 , a derivative of pSSV160 that lacks the secretion signal of SipB ( Kim et al. , 2007 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 3 ( d ) , recombinant SipB lacking a secretion signal could not be localized to the outer membrane . 
Furthermore , native SipB was not localized to the outer membrane in an invA mutant strain lacking SPI-1-dependent T3SS ( Fig. 1b ) . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that SipB localizes to the outer membrane following its secretion outside the cell . 
To further elucidate the residues responsible for the outermembrane localization of SipB , we first generated a template plasmid for alanine mutagenesis . 
We cloned a full-length sipB gene into a low-copy plasmid pMW118 ( pSM ) , and introduced the pSM plasmid into the DsipB strain . 
Preparation and analysis of culture supernatants , cell lysates and outer-membrane fractions from the DsipB mutant strain containing plasmid pSM confirmed that , consistent with wild-type SipB , recombinant SipB was expressed in the cytosol , secreted into the culture supernatant , and localized on the bacterial outer membrane ( Fig. 4 ) . 
We then used an oligo cassette mutagenesis approach ( see Methods ) to construct eight variant plasmids in which blocks of 4 aa were replaced with alanine , stepwise from amino acids 111 to 142 . 
Since a secondary-structure prediction of the N-terminal 160 aa of SipB revealed that amino acids 111 -- 118 represented a putative coiled-coil domain ( J net secondary structure prediction ; http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred/ ) , we hypothesized that the putative coiled-coil domain of SipB ( residues 111 -- 118 ) was associated with the interaction with the bacterial cell surface , and first selected the region between amino acids 111 and 142 ( pSA1 -- pSA8 ; see Table 1 ) for alanine substitution mutagenesis . 
SipBAla135-138 ( pSA7 ) and wild-type SipB ( pSM ) were both expressed and secreted to culture supernatants at wild-type levels , whereas the levels of SipBAla135-138 in the outer-membrane fraction were dramatically reduced ( Fig. 4b ) , demonstrating that amino acids 135 -- 138 of SipB are required for SipB localization in the outer membrane .

N-terminal amino acids 100 -- 140 of SipB are essential for its localization to the outer membrane . 
( a , b ) Cells containing pSSV1 , pSSV8 , pSSV15 , pSSV30 and pSSV160 were grown in LB broth containing 0.3 M NaCl to OD600 ~ 0.9 , and culture supernatant proteins , whole-cell lysates and outer-membrane proteins were prepared as described in Methods . 
Expression and secretion of the recombinant SipB proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-M45 mAbs . 
( c ) Cells harbouring pSSV1 , pSSV160 , pSSV72 , pSSV100 , pSSV120 and pSSV140 were grown in LB broth to OD600 ~ 0.9 , whole-cell lysates and outer-membrane proteins were prepared , and the recombinant SipB proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-M45 mAbs . 
( d ) Whole-cell lysates , supernatants and outer-membrane proteins from cells containing pSSV160 ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) and pSSVD2-30-LLO ( lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) were prepared , and recombinant SipB proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-M45 mAbs . 
OmpW was used as an outer-membrane marker and DnaK was used as a control for cytosolic protein contamination . 
DISCUSSION
Although numerous studies have examined the function of T3SS secretion proteins and translocons , the interaction between the translocon and the bacterial cell surface is less well understood . 
It was recently reported that IpaB and IpaD , the translocon proteins of Shigella , can be localized on the bacterial cell surface ( Olive et al. , 2007 ; Veenendaal et al. , 2007 ) . 
However , the surface localization of PopB and PopD of Pseudomonas , BopB and BopD of Bordetella , and BipB and BipD of Burkholderia have not yet been characterized . 
In the case of Salmonella , the surface localization of SipD has not been characterized before . 
It was recently suggested that the cell-surface localization of Shigella IpaB , which is homologous to SipB , could be dependent on the presence of IpaD , and furthermore that an interaction between IpaB and IpaD is required for insertion of the translocation pore into the host-cell membrane ( Johnson et al. , 2006 ; Veenendaal et al. , 2007 ) . 
In Salmonella , sipD mutants have been shown to be deficient for invasion of epithelial cells ( Kaniga et al. , 1995 ; Collazo & Galan , 1997 ) , even though these sipD mutants have increased secretion of Sip proteins ( Kaniga et al. , 1995 ) . 
Here , we showed that SipB could be localized to the bacterial outer membrane of a DsipD strain ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Therefore , we suggest that unlike IpaD ( Veenendaal et al. , 2007 ) , SipD does not participate in localizing SipB to the bacterial cell surface . 
SipB in S. typhimurium has been shown to have a few discrete functional domains , including a large C-terminal domain that contains two a-helical transmembrane regions essential to its integration into the host-cell plasma membrane ( McGhie et al. , 2002 ) . 
However , although numerous reports have focused on translocons , no earlier study has investigated whether IpaB and SipB have any specific regions required for bacterial surface localization . 
Here , we used deletion analysis to identify regions essential to the surface localization of SipB . 
Our results revealed that the N-terminal 160 aa of SipB ( SipB160 ) were sufficient to direct outer-membrane localization . 
More detailed analysis identified the region between amino acids 100 and 140 as being essential for the outer-membrane localization of SipB160 . 
Construction of plasmids encoding alaninesubstituted full-length SipB and their expression in the sipB deletion strain revealed that construct pSA7 , encoding SipBAla135-138 , exhibited reduced outer-membrane localization . 
These findings collectively indicated that the Nterminal amino acids 100 -- 140 of SipB are essential to its surface localization , and further suggested that SipB160 and wild-type SipB are localized to the same region of the Salmonella cell surface . 
Fig. 4 . 
N-terminal amino acids 135 -- 138 of SipB are indispensable for its localization to the bacterial outer membrane . 
( a ) Whole-cell lysates and culture supernatant proteins were prepared from wild-type cells ( lane 1 ) , DsipB cells ( lane 2 ) , and DsipB cells containing pSA7 ( lane 3 ) or pSM ( lane 4 ) . 
SipB and DnaK ( cytosolic contamination control , lower panel ) were detected with polyclonal antiSipB160 and monoclonal anti-DnaK antibodies , respectively . 
( b ) Expression of SipB protein in the outer-membrane fractions of wild-type cells ( lane 1 ) , DsipB cells ( lane 2 ) , and DsipB cells containing pSA7 ( lane 3 ) or pSM ( lane 4 ) . 
Outer-membrane fractions were prepared by sucrose density-gradient fractionation as described in Methods . 
For a more detailed comparison , fractions 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 , and 5 and 6 were pooled and resolved by SDS-PAGE , and the blots were detected with polyclonal anti-SipB160 , polyclonal anti-OmpW , and monoclonal anti-DnaK antibodies , respectively . 
OmpW was used as an outermembrane marker ( middle panel ) and DnaK was used to control for contamination of cytosolic proteins ( lower panel ) . 
Many proteins secreted through T3SS components have been predicted to share a common coiled-coil structure ( Pallen et al. , 1997 ; Delahay & Frankel , 2002 ) . 
The coiledcoil proteins are reported to interact with themselves and / or each other ( Delahay & Frankel , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , we hypothesized that residues 111 -- 118 of SipB are required for an interaction with the bacterial cell surface . 
However , our results revealed that N-terminal residues 135 -- 138 were indispensable for the surface localization of SipB . 
To further characterize residues 135 -- 138 , we aligned the amino acid sequences of BipB , IpaB and SipB . 
Interestingly , the amino acid 135 ( E , Glu ) in SipB ( corresponding to residues 152 in BipB and 129 in IpaB ) was identical in all three proteins , and a high sequence homology was found among residues 135 -- 138 ( data not shown ) . 
Glutamic acid is a negatively charged amino acid typically found on the surface of proteins . 
Thus , residue 135 may play a role in the binding of SipB to the outer membrane by interacting with proteins or other molecules . 
This study revealed that a recombinant SipB protein ( pSSVD2-30 ) lacking a secretion signal could not be localized to the outer membrane , and invA mutant cells failing to secrete SipB also failed to show its localization to the outer membrane , suggesting that SipB is localized to the outer membrane after its secretion outside the cell . 
Our findings of the secretion-dependent localization of SipB to the outer membrane are consistent with an earlier report that showed that an invJ mutant , which was defective in secretion of SipB protein to the culture supernatant , also failed to show SipB localization to the bacterial cell surface ( Collazo & Galan , 1996 ) . 
Although the SPI-2-encoded translocon ( SseB , SseC and SseD ) is structurally different from that involving SPI-1 , the former is also known to be localized to the outer surface of the bacterial cell after secretion in vitro ( Beuzon et al. , 1999 ; Klein & Jones , 2001 ; Nikolaus et al. , 2001 ) . 
Therefore , it seems as though the secretion of translocons such as SipB is indispensable for their localization to the bacterial cell surface . 
Although future work will be required to elucidate the mechanism ( s ) underlying the specific targeting of SipB to the bacterial cell surface , our novel finding that the N-terminal region of SipB is required for its localization to the surface of Salmonella may provide new insights into the presence of translocons on the bacterial cell surface .
