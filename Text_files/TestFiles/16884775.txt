Abstract

or without S. typhimurium DT104 , and perfused . 
Whole mucosal gene expression was analyzed by cDNA array on 0 , 2 , 4 , and 8 h post-infection . 
Invasion resulted in the upregulation of only eight transcripts in jejunal mucosa , among those the proinﬂammatory IL-8 ( at 4 h only ) , and the antiinﬂammatory STAT3 ( at 4 and 8 h ) . 
The limited number of differentially expressed genes found here in vivo compared to in vitro is most likely due to the presence of multiple , heterogenous cell interactions in intact mucosa . 
Furthermore , it is concluded that S. typhimurium evades strong host responses by downregulating the local inﬂammatory response .

ied pathogens , not much progress has been made in terms of prevention and treatment of resulting disease . 
Salmonella has been well characterized in terms of genetics , physiology , and virulence factors . 
Furthermore , the invasion process has been described histologically in several animal models , and in one recent study , in human small intestinal explants ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Haque et al. , 2004 ) . 
In contrast , understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction and how it causes disease is very limited .

available on the molecular events during Salmonella -- host interaction originates from infection experiments using isolated cells or cell lines such as macrophages and enterocytes ( Eckmann et al. , 2000 ; Rosenberger et al. , 2001 ; Nau et al. , 2002 ) . 
Although these models have their advantages , there are also obvious limitations . 
The main drawback is that these cells operate in isolation with homologous interactions , whereas in vivo Salmonella interacts with a multitude of different interacting cell types in the intestinal mucosa in vivo during the invasion process ( Finlay and Brumell , 2000 ) . 
after S. typhimurium ) , several mammalian animal models are available . 
Mice are often used , but S. typhimurium causes typhoid fever in this species . 
In pigs , S. typhimurium causes a disease very similar to humans . 
Confusingly , S. typhimurium associated disease is traditionally called gastroenteritis in humans and enterocolitis in pigs , however , there is accumulating evidence that in humans S. typhimurium also causes an enterocolitis ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
Furthermore , genome analysis show Concerning Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ( here-pig and human to be much closer related than rodents and the great similarity between the two species in the alimentary tract makes the pig the model of choice for gastrointestinal research ( Wernersson et al. , 2005 ) .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
were purchased from a Salmonella free commercial piggery . 
Salmonella free status was conﬁrmed by culturing faeces samples 1 day previous to the start of the experiment . 
The animal experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Commission in Lelystad , The Netherlands , in accordance with the Dutch law on animal experimentation . 
Piglets ( cross-bred Yorkshire × ( Large White × Landrace ) ) 
2.2. Bacterial strain
calf and child on a Dutch farm . 
All three isolates were indistinguishable by phenotypic and genotypic methods , and were typed as S. typhimurium DT104A ( Hendriksen et al. , 2004 ) ( a kind gift by Dr. E van Duijkeren of the Veterinary Microbiological Diagnostic Center of the Utrecht University , The Netherlands ) . 
The Salmonella strain used was isolated from a diseased pig , 
2.3. Small intestinal segment perfusion (SISP) technique
al. , 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , four piglets ( 6 -- 7 weeks old ) were sedated with 0.1 ml azaperone ( Stressnil ) , per kg body weight , after 15 min , inhalation anesthesia was initiated with a gas-mixture of 39 % oxygen , 58 % nitrous oxide and an initial 3 % isoﬂurane ; after 10 min 2 % isoﬂurane . 
The abdominal cavity was opened and four pairs of small intestinal segments were prepared and a small cranial inlet tube , and a wider caudal outlet tube were attached to seven segments . 
The ﬁrst two segments were located in the proximal jejunum directly after the ligament of Treitz . 
Segments 3 and 4 were located in the mid jejunum , and segments 5 -- 7 in the ileum . 
The odd numbered segments ( initially 40 cm ) were perfused for 1 h with peptone solution containing 109 CFU/ml of S. typhimurium , followed by perfusion with peptone only . 
Control segments ( # 2 , 4 , 6 ) ( initially 20 cm ) were perfused with peptone only . 
Mucosal samples for immune histology and RNA-isolation ( 10 cm ) were taken at 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 h as indicated in Fig. 1 , the tubing reconnected , and perfusion resumed . 
Perfusion was performed manually with syringes attached to the cranial tubes , 2 ml every 15 min . 
After perfusion , the pigs were euthanized by barbiturate overdose . 
Mucosal scrapings ( approximately 1 g/sample ) were taken for microarray analysis , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 70 ◦ C . 
The SISP was performed essentially as described ( Niewold et 
2.4. Isolation of total RNA
BRL ) , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C. Further extraction of RNA from these homogenates was performed according to instructions of the manufacturer of TRIzol ® reagent . 
The crude RNA pellet obtained from this isolation procedure was dissolved in 1 ml RNase-free water , and precipitated with 0.25 ml of isopropanol and 0.25 ml of 0.8 M sodium citrate/1 .2 M NaCl to remove proteoglycan and polysaccharide contamination . 
After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature RNA pellets were washed with 75 % ( v/v ) ethanol and dissolved in RNase-free water . 
Subsequently , the RNA was treated with DNase , extracted with phenol-chloroform , and precipitated with ethanol . 
RNA pellets were washed with 75 % ( v/v ) ethanol , dissolved in RNase-free water , and stored at − 70 ◦ C until further use . 
The integrity of the RNA was checked by analyzing 0.5 g on a 1 % ( w/v ) agarose gel . 
A part of the isolated RNA was used to prepare RNA pools for microarray analysis . 
Pools were prepared for each SISP segment collected at different time points ( 0 and 8 h mock infected , and 2 , 4 and 8 h infected ) by mixing equal amounts of RNA isolated from similar segments of all four pigs ( n = 4 ) . 
Tissue was homogenized in 10 ml TRIzol ® reagent ( Gibco ¬

ments ( hereafter denoted as probes ) as in our earlier study ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the inserts of 3486 clones from a home made porcine jejunal EST library were ampliﬁed by PCR and spotted in triplicate on Corning UltraGAPS slides . 
Dual color hybridization of slides was performed using the RNA MICROMAX TSA labelling and detection kit ( Perkin-Elmer ) as described ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , a labelled cDNA target was prepared from 1 g of RNA template from the 0 h mock infected pool using biotin ( BI ) and a ﬂuorescein ( FL ) labeled cDNA target was prepared from 1 g of RNA template from the 2 , 4 , or 8 h infected , or 8 h mock infected RNA pool . 
BI and FL labeled cDNA targets were simultaneously hybridized to a microarray slide and sequentially detected with the ﬂuorescent reporter molecule Cy5 ( BI ) and Cy3 ( FL ) , respec Microarray slides were spotted with the same cDNA fragtively , in a Packard Bioscience BioChip Technologies apparatus ( Perkin-Elmer ) . 
For each comparison a second hybridization experiment was performed in which the BI and FL labels were reversed ( dye-swap ) . 
Using the ScanarrayTM-express software package ( Perkin-Elmer ) spots were automatically gridded and raw spot intensities were corrected for local background signal using the `` adaptive circle quantitation method '' . 
Spots with intensity below the background threshold were automatically discarded from the data analysis . 
Irregular sized and/or shaped spots were eliminated by visual inspection . 
Data were presented in an M/A plot . 
M is the ( log ) 2 ratio of Cy5 over Cy3 ( M = log2 ( Cy5/Cy3 ) ) a √ Cy3 intensity ( A = log2 ( Cy5 × Cy3 ) ) . 
An intensity-dependent normalization was performed using the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing ( LOWESS ) function in the statistical software package R , with a fraction of 0.2 on all data points . 
Normalized data ﬁles from each hybridisation were imported in the Spotﬁre DecisionSite program ( Version 7.2 , BioASP , The Netherlands ) to select signiﬁcantly differential expressed spots with M values ( log2 scale ) of < − 1.58 or > 1.58 ( meaning a ratio greater than 3-fold , and with a p-value < 0.025 ) . 
For each probe six spots were hybridized , three for one slide and three for the dye-swap . 
Probes with more than two missing values were removed from further analysis . 
Probes that hybridized differently were sequenced ( when not annotated yet ) as described ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
Sequence results were assembled and compared with the NCBI non redundant ( nr ) and mRNA reference sequence database and/or the porcine and human EST databases ( TIGR ) using blastn options . 
The presumed constitutive proteins I-FABP and keratin 20 served as normal controls .

2.6. Real-time PCR
Protein ( PAP : alias PTP/REG3A ) was validated by real-time PCR . 
For each individual RNA sample , 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed in a standard RT reaction using Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) and pd ( N ) 6 primers . 
A 20-mer forward primer ( 5 ′ - GAAGATTCCCCAGCAGACAC-3 ′ ) and a 19-mer reverse primer ( 5 ′ - AGGACACGAAGGATGCCTC-3 ′ ) , homologue to nt 330 -- 349 and nt 501 -- 519 of the tentative consensus sequence pig | TC200395 posted in the TIGR database , respectively , were used to quantify PAP cDNA in RT reactions in a standard LightCycler ( Roche Diagnostics ) reaction using Cybergreen as label . 
The relative amount of PAP mRNA in all RT reactions was calculated by extrapolation of the cycle crossing point on a standard curve prepared from dilutions of an RNA sample with a high concentration of PAP mRNA ( as was established by Northern blot analysis ; RNA isolate 7E ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
The concentration of 18S rRNA was determined in the same RT reactions by real-time PCR and used to normalize the relative amount of PAP mRNA in all individual samples .

Brieﬂy , endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol . 
Normal goat serum ( 10 % ( v/v ) ; Jackson Immunoresearch West Grove , Pennsylvania , USA ) was used to reduce non-speciﬁc background staining . 
After incubation with the secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Vector , Burlingame , CA , USA ; 1:250 in PBS + 2.5 % BSA ) sections were treated with ABC/PO reagent ( Vector ) for 30 min . 
Between steps , sections were rinsed in PBS/Tween . 
To visualize the antigen , sections were incubated with DAB ( 3,3 ′ - diamino-benzidine , Sigma ) , 0.05 % in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6 , 0.03 % hydrogen peroxide ) for 10 min . 
3. Results
lially in all three ( jejunal and ileal ) locations at 2 , 4 , and 8 h. Similar patterns were observed in proximal and mid jejunum and ileum ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The SISP procedure itself led to increasing histological edema and cellular ( neutrophil ) inﬁltration ( Veldhuizen et al. , 2007 ) . 
Mid jejunal mucosal gene expression analysis by a pig cDNA small intestinal microarray showed that compared with time 0 h , neither down-regulated genes were found , nor any up-regulated genes at 2 h , except for CYP3A ( cytochrome P450 3A29 ) . 
CYP3A expression further increased at 4 and 8 h. Comparison of differential expression in uninfected segments between 8 and 0 h , showed that CYP3A was upregulated by the SISP procedure itself , being signiﬁcantly higher than in the infected segments . 
Seven other different genes were upregulated at 4 and 8 h. Up-regulated transcripts could be grouped into different reaction patterns , at 4 h only , at both 4 and 8 h , and at 8 h only . 
Interleukin 8 ( IL-8 ) , and transmembrane 4L six family member 20 ( TM4SF20 ) showed a transient response at 4 h. Apart from CYP3A , three other genes showed differential expression at both 4 and 8 h , matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) , pancreatitis associated protein ( PAP ) , and signal transducer Immune histologically , S. typhimurium was found subepitheand activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) . 
Two transcripts showed a response on 8 h only , THO complex 4 ( THOC4 ) , and one of unknown function , which was previously found to be present on a microarray created from porcine Peyer 's patch ( Dvorak et al. , 2005 ) . 
Intestinal fatty acid binding protein ( I-FABP ) , the control for epithelial content ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) , and keratin 20 showed no signiﬁcant differential expression ( Table 1 ) .

4. Discussion
pathogens into the host is a prerequisite for the rational design of prevention and treatment of infection and disease . 
Unfortunately , our knowledge on Salmonella typhimurium in this respect is very limited . 
A major problem is of course the relative inaccessability of gastrointestinal tract in humans . 
Indeed , from literature data on animal models , it is not even clear what the most important ( early ) site of invasion is . 
There is evidence to indicate that the ileum is a major site of invasion , but the more proximal sites have not been studied as yet ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
In most animal models , researchers have looked histologically at ileum and colon , and the time points sampled are usually days rather than hours post-infection . 
Histological data from earlier events were only available from the ligated loop technique in rabbit , and in guinea pig ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
Furthermore , using the ileal ligated loop technique in pigs , ultrastructural invasion of Salmonella was shown to occur within minutes ( Meyerholz et al. , 2002 ) . 
The only data on early histological events in humans were recently obtained using small intestinal biopsies ( Haque et al. , 2004 ) . 
Whereas there obviously is histological information on in vivo S. typhimurium invasion , data on the molecular cellular responses are limited to infection experiments using isolated cells or cell lines . 
segment perfusion ( SISP ) technique because in this model the intestines have intact blood ﬂow , and ( as opposed to the ligated loop technique ) luminal ﬂow . 
Also , innervation is present , which is very important because the nervous system modulates the ( intestinal ) inﬂammatory response locally ( Tracey , 2002 ) . 
Furthermore , the system allows for sampling at various time points . 
Immune histologically , S. typhimurium appeared to invade very quickly ( within 2 h ) in all three ( jejunal and ileal ) locations . 
Similar patterns and bacterial numbers were observed in proximal and mid jejunum and ileum . 
It was decided to use the material of mid jejunum for transcriptional analysis because this enabled comparison with earlier experiments with enterotoxic E. coli ( ETEC ) , a non-invasive close relative of Salmonella ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
In contrast to the ETEC experiment , in this case the SISP procedure itself led to increasing histological edema and cellular inﬁltration , which is probably caused by the repeated manipulation of the intestines required to obtain the samples on successive time points . 
In terms of gene expression though , the effect of the procedure itself ( 0 h versus 8 h Elucidation of the mechanisms involved in invasion of In the present study , we have chosen to use the small intestinal remained limited to elevated expression of CYP3A , and possibly of MMP-1 . 
No other ( histological ) alterations were observed . 
Comparing infected with control segments , CYP3A was the only gene upregulated at 2 h. Although this could represent ( in part ) de novo transcription , this is interpreted as consistent with the observed inﬂux of neutrophils , which have high constitutive expression of CYP3A ( Staerkel et al. , 1999 ) . 
Interestingly , neutrophils were already several decades ago suggested to play an important role in Salmonella induced diarrhea ( Gianella et al. , 1975 ) . 
CYP3A expression further elevated during the experiment . 
Remarkably , the CYP3A expression infected versus mock was consistently lower of that of mock 0 h versus 8 h . 
This is interpreted as a down-regulatory effect of the Salmonella infection on either neutrophil inﬂux or CYP3A expression , or a combination of both . 
intestinal microarray showed that S. typhimurium infection induced expression of seven other genes at 4 and 8 h. No downregulated genes were found . 
IL-8 ( a chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils ) showed a transient response at 4 h only , as did TM4SF20 , of unknown function . 
TM4SF20 is a member of a family of transmembrane proteins , and in human organs highest relative expression was found in the small intestine ( http://genome-www5.stanford.edu ) . 
Two transcripts showed a response at 8 h only . 
One of unknown function was previously found to be present on a microarray created from porcine Peyer 's patch ( Dvorak et al. , 2005 ) . 
The other two genes are involved in transcriptional control , THOC4 is a transcriptional coactivator with a role in nuclear export of mRNA . 
A further three genes showed differential expression at 4 and 8 h. MMP-1 had a similar elevated level at 4 and 8 h. PAP showed at 4 h a response similar to that of MMP-1 , but increased further at 8 h. Comparison with in vitro results obtained with Salmonella spp . 
suggests IL-8 to originate from enterocytes and macrophages , and MMP-1 from macrophages ( Gianella et al. , 1975 ; Hobbie et al. , 1997 ; Detweiler et al. , 2001 ; Nau et al. , 2002 ) . 
MMP-1 was also found expressed by intestinal ﬁbroblasts in inﬂammatory conditions , and is important in tissue remodelling ( Salmela et al. , 2002 ) . 
PAP is of enterocyte ( Paneth cell ) origin , and several different functions were described . 
PAP has anti-bacterial properties , promotes epithelial cell proliferation , and has an antiinﬂammatory effect by inhibiting macrophages ( Iovanna et al. , 1991 ; Moucadel et al. , 2001 ; Vasseur et al. , 2004 ) . 
In the present experiment , a strong PAP reaction was seen , similar to our previous experiments with ETEC in the SISP technique ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
The magnitude of the PAP response suggests an important role , possibly in the innate defense against ( gram negative ) bacteria . 
Given the striking response , it is surprising that PAP was not described before in Salmonella infections in for instance cell lines ( Eckmann et al. , 2000 ) . 
However , data are very limited thusfar , and the absence of a PAP response in HT29 cell line could also be due to its absence from the array used , or HT29 cells could be defective for PAP , or the induction of PAP could require the interaction with other cell types . 
A third transcript expressed at 4 and 8 h at a similar level was STAT3 , also known as acute phase response factor . 
STAT3 is associated with suppression of macrophage function , and in the intestine is Mucosal gene expression analysis by a pig cDNA small involved in the nervous anti-inﬂammatory reﬂex ( Tracey , 2002 ; ( Kubo et al. , 2003 ) . 
Brieﬂy , what has emerged in recent years is that intestinal macrophages stimulated by pro-inﬂammatory cytokines are normally down-regulated by cholinergic stimulation mediated through the nervus vagus . 
Cytokines binding to a cytokine receptor activate the anti-inﬂammatory Jak2-STAT3 pathway by phosphorylation of STAT3 . 
The anti-inﬂammatory effect is dependent on binding of acetylcholine to the acetylcholine receptor ( 7nAChR ) on the macrophage , and on STAT3 expression ( de Jonge et al. , 2005 ) . 
Furthermore , binding of acetylcholine to the acetylcholine receptor also leads to inhibition of NF - B nuclear translocation and transactivation activity which also produces anti-inﬂammatory effects ( Metz and Tracey , 2005 ) . 
It is as yet not clear whether these two pathways are really separate ( Metz and Tracey , 2005 ) . 
However it is clear that containing the inﬂammatory response in the intestine is very important , in which process the vagal anti-inﬂammatory reﬂex and STAT3 are crucial . 
Supporting this notion is that inﬂammatory bowel diseases are associated with abnormal STAT3 expression patterns ( de Jonge et al. , 2005 ; Mudter et al. , 2005 ; Smith et al. , 2005 ) . 
In our experiment , upregulation of STAT3 appears to be related to Salmonella since it occurs only in the infected segments . 
STAT3 upregulation in the latter may explain the concomitant downregulation of CYP3A compared to the control at 8 h. only a limited number of genes are found upregulated , whereas the magnitude of upregulation is much greater in the SISP . 
Another difference is that in vitro in HT29 cells both up and down-regulated genes were found , whereas we found no downregulated genes ( Eckmann et al. , 2000 ) . 
In macrophages , expression differences of a larger magnitude were found ( Rosenberger et al. , 2000 ) . 
Based on this , it is tempting to attribute the larger magnitude responses in the SISP to the macrophage population , however , the largest response found is from PAP , which is of clear enterocyte origin . 
One of the reasons for the limited amount of regulated genes found , could be in vivo dilution or averaging out of relevant gene expression due to the presence of a multitude of heterogenous ( opposedly reacting ) cell types in vivo ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
Second , certain relevant genes could be absent from the microarray . 
Whereas all this is possible , fact is that using the same array and ETEC , at least 100 relevant genes did react , which is an indication for the validity of the system ( Niewold et al. , 2005 ) . 
The difference found rather points at a difference in the nature of the stimulus between ETEC and Salmonella , since in both experiments similar amounts of bacteria were used . 
In the case of Salmonella , it is possible that only part of bacteria participates in invasion , thus causing a lower stimulus ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
On the other hand , the ETEC strain used is not invasive at all . 
It is conceivable that the strong reaction to ETEC is associated with its enterotoxins , whereas the role ( if any ) of enterotoxins in Salmonella is unclear ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
Alternatively , S. typhimurium could be well adapted to not evoke strong host responses . 
mucosa to invasion by Salmonella is indeed represented by a limited number of up-regulated genes . 
The most likely explanatio Comparing with in vitro results obtained with enterocytes , We conclude that the transcriptional response of intact for the difference found with in vitro results , is that a heterogenous mixture of cell types reacts differently from a homogenous population ( Finlay and Brumell , 2000 ) . 
The latter is bound to be unphysiologically reactive in the absence of other modulating cell types . 
In particular , the absence of vagal anti-inﬂammatory regulation will inﬂuence results ( Tracey , 2002 ) . 
Furthermore , it is clear that intestinal explants ( although containing multiple cell types ) lack vagal modulation and the inﬂux of cells such as neutrophils which appear to play an early , and important role in Salmonella pathogenesis . 
cell lines could assist in dissecting complex data sets from microarray hybridisations of complex tissues ( Rosenberger et al. , 2001 ) . 
The present results conﬁrm that extrapolation from in vitro results to the in vivo situation should be done with great caution ( Reid et al. , 2003 ) . 
Based on the above , it is concluded that in vitro models are unlikely to give insight into the complex in vivo mechanisms of Salmonella -- host interactions . 
Furthermore , we conclude that any valid model should include the nervous and circulatory components of the host response . 
Therefore , the SISP technique is a valuable tool in the ( genomic ) analysis of early host responses to intestinal challenges . 
Future experiments will involve more detailed analysis of the role of the nervus vagus in inﬂammatory processes in the intestine .
