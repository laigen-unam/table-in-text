Abstract 
Salmonella typhi is an important human pathogen responsible for typhoid fever . 
Type IVB pili , encoded by the S. typhi pil operon located in the major pathogenicity island , are used to facilitate bacterial entry into human intestinal cells in vitro and may be important in the mediation of enteric fever in humans . 
However , possible involvement of the type IVB pili of S. typhi in signal transduction in infected immune cells has not been examined previously . 
In this study , we have compared the effect of piliated and nonpiliated S. typhi on the activities of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the production of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and nuclear transcription factor NF-kB in human monocytic THP-1 cells . 
We ﬁnd that piliated S. typhi can stimulate signiﬁcantly higher activities of PKC , the production of IL-6 and NF-kB than a nonpiliated strain based on substrate phosphorolysis kinase assay , Western blot , RT-PCR , and luciferase reporter gene assay . 
In time course experiments , PKC activity increased in a time-dependent fashion after stimulation by the piliated bacteria . 
The PKC inhibitor Dequalinium chloride ( DECA ) remarkably reduced the production of IL-6 , NF-kB and the activity of PKC induced by the piliated S. typhi . 
These results suggest that the induction of IL-6 and NF-kB depend on the PKC signal pathway . 
Our report demonstrates that the type IVB pili of S. typhi play important roles in the production of NF-kB and the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-6 , and in the stimulation of PKC activity and therefore , may have effects on the development of fever and other inﬂammatory responses .

Introduction
Among about 2300 closely related Salmonella ser-ovars , Salmonella enterica serovar typhi ( S. typhi ) is a human-restricted pathogen and causes the systemic febrile illness typhoid fever ( Graham , 2002 ; Pasetti et al. , 2003 ) . 
S. typhi efﬁciently invades the intestinal mucosa and survives as an intracellular pathogen o macrophages and possibly dendritic cells . 
Human cell infection with S. typhi can induce the production of multiple cytokines . 
The immune response against this pathogen includes both humoral and cell-mediated immunity ( Jones and Falkow , 1996 ; Pang et al. , 1998 ) . 
Since 1992 , S. typhi resistance to multiple antibiotics has become an important and severe problem ( Graham , 2002 ; Pang et al. , 1998 ) . 
The lack of perfect vaccines and the bacteria 's resistance to multiple antibiotics have resulted from the limited understanding of the patho-genic mechanism and host processes of S. typhi ( Graham , 2002 ; Jones and Falkow , 1996 ) . 
The immune response induced by the bacterial virulence factors needs to be further investigated . 
It has been shown that the virulence factors of S. typhi are related to endotoxins or polysaccharide capsules ( Elhofy and Bost , 1999 ; Elhofy et al. , 2000 ) . 
However , S. typhi J34 ( Vi , absence of the virulence polysacchar-ide antigen ) remains virulent in humans ( Hone et al. , 1988 ) . 
Bacterial type IV pili genes located in the pathogenicity island are important factors in the pathogenicity associated with infections . 
Type IV pili of Vibrio cholerae may act as mediators to attach human cells ( Karaolis et al. , 1998 , 1999 ) . 
The pili of Pseudo-monas aeruginosa can induce the epithelial cells to produce nuclear transcription factor ( NF-kB ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) ( DiMango et al. , 1998 ) . 
Type IV bundle-forming pili of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) are required for localized adherence and virulence ( Klumpp et al. , 2001 ) . 
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis harbors a type IV pilus cluster which contributes to pathogenicity ( Collyn et al. , 2002 ) . 
S. typhi was recently identiﬁed to contain type IVB pili encoded by a pil operon located in pathogenicity island SPI7 ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ; Pickard et al. , 2003 ) . 
Moreover , expression of the type IVB pili is conﬁned to serovar Typhi and few human-invasive strains of S. serovar Parotyphi C and Dublin ( Morris et al. , 2003 ; Tam et al. , 2004 ) . 
The type IVB pili of S. typhi are not found in the chromosome of S. typhimurium , which is normally noninvasive for humans ( Zhang et al. , 1997 , 2000 ) . 
The type IVB pil operon in S. typhi contains 11 genes , pilLMNOPQR-STUV , in which pilS encodes the main structural protein of the type IVB pili ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) . 
Nonpiliated Typhi strain pilS : : Km ( pil ) reduces the ability of r serovar Typhi to enter human intestinal cells in vitro , and puriﬁed prePilS protein inhibits such entry by piliated Typhi bacteria ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) . 
During Salmonella bacterial infections , monocytes and macrophages serve as key effector cells of the immune response . 
However , evidence for possible involvement of type IVB pili of S. typhi in the regulation of signal transduction pathways in infected monocytes and macrophages has not been deﬁned as yet . 
In this study , we explored the roles of the type IVB pili of S. typhi on the production of IL-6 and the regulation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity on cell signal transduction pathways in a human monocytic leukemia cell line ( THP-1 cells ) .

Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
A Pre-Tag and nonradioactive assay kit for the detection of PKC was purchased from Promega ( Madison , WI , USA ) . 
PKC activity was expressed as nanomoles of phosphopeptide synthesized per minute per milliliter . 
The PKC activator , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) was purchased from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO , USA ) . 
The PKC inhibitor Dequalinium chloride ( DECA ) was purchased from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . 
PMA and DECA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and stored at 20 1C as recommended by the manufacturer . 
The ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit was obtained from MBI Ferments ( MD , USA ) . 
The luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega ( WI , USA ) . 
DEAE-dextran was from Pharmacia ( Amersham Biosciences , Sweden ) ; RPMI-1640 , OPTI-MEM , fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and all other cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco Life Technologies ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) . 
Bacteria and bacterial growth conditions
Piliated S. typhi A21-6 ( type IVB pil ) strain and + nonpiliated S. typhi pilS : : Km ( type IVB pil ) strain r ( Zhang et al. , 2000 ) were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth for 14 -- 16 h at 30 1C . 
A21-6 strain was generated by inserting a tac promoter into the location between pilM and pilN with the 575-nucleotide pilM -- pilN intergenic sequence removed . 
Therefore , transcription of the pilN through pilV genes of the pil operon was under the control of the tac promoter . 
This construct does not disrupt other genes , such as LPS , that are controlled by different promoters . 
The nonpiliated strain was generated by inserting a kanamycin gene into the pilS gene so that the destruction of the pilin operon did not inﬂuence other gene expression that was under the control of different promoters . 
Bacteria in the logarithmic phase of growth were determined spectrophotome-trically by measuring OD600 at approximately 0.6 . 
Bacteria in the logarithmic phase were washed three times with PBS and diluted as required with RPMI-1640 . 
Preparation of cells and cell lines
The differentiated THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 with HEPES supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS , glutamine ( 2 mM ) , penicillin ( 100 U ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 U/ml ) at 37 1C in 5 % ( v/v ) CO2 . 
Before use , the serum concentration was reduced to 5 % for 24 h at 37 1C and the cells were subjected to differentiation with 30 nM PMA at 1 10 cells/ml for 6 40 h in a Teﬂon-coated bottle and then the medium was changed to serum-free medium for at least 10 -- 12 h. PMA was used as a speciﬁc activator of groupA and groupB PKCs ( in the 1 -- 100 nM range ) . 
A small amount of PMA ( 30 nM in this experiment ) could induce activation of PKCs , but a large amount of PMA ( 4100 nM ) depleted most PKC activity . 
This procedure eliminated most effects of serum on signaling cascades and the production of IL-6 . 
Upon routine subculture of THP-1 cells exposed to PMA , there was no distinct morphological change observed 8 h after subculture , except cells become adherent to the plastic culture dishes . 
However , after 48 h subculture in the presence of PMA , 90 % of the cells showed morphological characteristics of differentiated macrophages . 
Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test . 
Fresh adult healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated from healthy volunteers and separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients ( Pharmacia , MI , USA ) from sterile heparinized blood . 
Cells from the interface were washed twice with RPMI-1640 and then seeded at a density of 1 10 / ml 6 in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 30 nM PMA into 24-well plates ( 1 ml/well ) and incubated at 37 1C in a 5 % ( v/v ) CO2 atmosphere for 120 min . 
Differentiated THP-1 treatments
Differentiated THP-1 cells ( 3 10 or 5 10 ) were 6 6 stimulated with S. typhi A21-6 ( pil ) and S. typhi + pilS : : Km ( pil ) strain for various times , respectively . 
The ﬁnal incubation volume was 3 ml of RPMI-1640 medium in 6-well plates . 
In some cases , cells were pre-incubated with 15 mM DECA before stimulation with bacteria . 
After incubation , cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffed saline ( PBS , pH 7.4 , without Ca and Mg ) and resuspended in 100 2 + 2 + ml of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0.1 % NP-40 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 0.2 mM PMSF , 0.5 mg/ml Aprotinin , 1 mM DTT ) . 
After incubation on ice for 30 min , the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 1C and the supernatants were removed and stored at 70 1C until used . 
Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce , NY , USA ) . 
Cytokine assays
Differentiated THP-1 cells and PBMC pre-treated with PMA ( 30 nM for 120 min ) were seeded at 10 cells / 6 ml in 1 ml RPMI-1640 medium in 24-well plates . 
The cultures were prepared in duplicate and stimulated with various concentrations ( 10 cfu , 10 cfu , 3 10 cfu ) of 6 7 7 piliated or nonpiliated S. typhi . 
Supernatants were removed from the wells at 5 h post-stimulation and stored at 20 1C until used . 
The amounts of IL-6 in cell culture supernatants were quantiﬁed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay . 
Plates ( 96-well ) were coated with anti-human IL-6 MAb in advance ( commercial pro-ducts ) . 
The levels of IL-6 secreted from cells were detected using the cytokine-speciﬁc ELISA Kits ( R & D , USA ) . 
RT-PCR
Cells were collected 5 h after stimulation and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent ( Molecular Research Center , USA ) . 
Total RNA was puriﬁed by chloroform , precipitated with isopropyl alcohol , washed with 75 % ethanol and redissolved in 0.1 % diethylpyr-ocarbonate ( DEPC ) - treated dH2O and stored at 80 1C . 
All RNA samples were measured as OD260/28041 .7 . 
The cDNA was prepared by the ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer ( MBI Ferments , MD , USA ) . 
A 628-bp PCR product of IL-6 was ampliﬁed using primers , 50-ATG AAC TCC TTC TCC ACA AGC GC ( sense primer ) and 50-GTC AGG TCG GAC TCC CGA GAA ( antisense primer ) . 
The primers for ampliﬁcation of the human b-actin were , 50-GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC CA ( sense primer ) and 50-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC ( antisense primer ) . 
PCR reactions were carried out in a DNA thermal cycler in the presence of sense and antisense primer ( ﬁnal concentration 500 nM ) , 20 mM of 4dNTP , 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase in a ﬁnal volume of 50 ml . 
The PCR conditions used were for IL-6 : 94 1C 45 s , 60 1C 45 s , 72 1C 90 s , 30 cycles , and for b-actin : 92 1C 45 s , 55 1C 45 s , 72 1C 90 s , 30 cycles . 
The ampliﬁed PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining . 
PKC assays
PKC activities were detected by the Promega Pre Tag Assays Kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) using a PKC-speciﬁc peptide as substrate . 
The PepTag C1 peptide was P-L-S-R-T-L-S-V-A-A-K . 
The kit contained PKC-positive and PKC-negative controls . 
According to the PKC assay protocols , the Pre Tag Assay utilized a ﬂuorescent peptide substrate that was highly speciﬁc for PKC . 
Phosphorylation of the speciﬁc peptide substrate by PKC altered the peptide 's net charge from +1 to 1 , which allowed the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated versions of the substrate to be rapidly separated on agarose gels . 
The gel wa photographed on a transilluminator . 
The activity of PKC was quantitated by using a razor blade to excise the negatively charged phosphorylated bands from the gel . 
Gel slices were melted at 95 1C and product absorbance was measured at 570 nm . 
NF-jB assay
THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene ( Stratagene , TX , USA ) under the control of NF-kB responsible elements using DEAE-dextran mediated transfection protocol . 
THP-1 cells ( 10 / ml ) were incubated with 2 g DNA and 100 g / 7 ml DEAE-dextran in OPTI-MEM medium for 150 min at 37 1C . 
The cells were then treated with 10 % DMSO for 2 min at room temperature and plated onto 6-well plates ( 3 10 cells per well ) and incubated with 6 RPMI-1640 containing 5 % FBS for another 24 h . 
After 24 h , the cells were further cultured in the presence of PMA at a ﬁnal concentration of 30 nM for 12 h and then stimulated with piliated or nonpiliated S. typhi strain . 
Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit with a Turner model TD-20e luminometer . 
The luciferase activity was reported as relative light units . 
Phosphorylated-ERK detected by Western blot
Equal amounts of each sample were analyzed separated by 12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes . 
Ten percent fat-free milk powders were used in blocking buffer . 
The membrane was incubated with primary antibody ( a mouse antibody speciﬁc for the phosphorylated form of ERK ) for 1 h at room temperature , washed three times , and then incubated with 1:1000 alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) conjugated anti-mouse IgG . 
Color was developed with nitroblue-tetrazolium and bromo-chloro-indolyl-phosphate .

Results
Induction of IL-6 production in humanTHP-1 cells and PBMCs
To address whether the type IVB pili could enhance the production of cytokine , THP-1 cells ( 1 10 ) were 6 infected for 5 h with different amounts ( 1 10 cfu , 6 1 10 cfu , 3 10 cfu ) of piliated S. typhi or non-7 7 piliated S. typhi strain . 
The culture supernatant from infected THP-1 cells was harvested and the presence of IL-6 detected by ELISA . 
Results indicated that both piliated and nonpiliated strains could induce the production of IL-6 compared to the negative control ( Po0 :01 ) ( Fig. 1A ) . 
However , the level of IL-production induced by the piliated strain was higher than that of the nonpiliated strain ( Po0 :05 ) ( Fig. 1A ) . 
In order to examine whether the type IVB pili contribute to IL-6 production in healthy human PBMCs , PBMCs were infected with different amounts ( 1 10 cfu , 1 10 cfu , 3 10 cfu ) of piliated or 6 7 7 nonpiliated S. typhi strains , respectively , for 5 h. Results indicated that the level of IL-6 production was increased by 2-fold after piliated S. typhi stimulation compared to that of nonpiliated S. typhi ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Maximal IL-6 was produced when the ratio of bacterium : cell was 1:1 in the case of piliated S. typhi infection . 
Effects of the type IVB pili on IL-6 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells stimulated with S. typhi were also determined by RT-PCR . 
THP-1 ( 5 10 ) cells were 6 infected for 5 h with different amounts of either the piliated or nonpiliated strain . 
mRNA was isolated from infected cells and IL-6 mRNA and human b-actin ( as an inner control ) were analyzed by semi-quantitative RTPCR . 
Results showed that THP-1 cells infected with piliated A21-6 induced higher IL-6 mRNA levels than the nonpiliated strain ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The maximal IL-6 mRNA level was produced when the ratio of bacterium to cell was 1:1 . 
This result was consistent with that of the production of IL-6 in THP-1 cells infected with S. typhi and suggested that type IVB pili had strong stimulating effects on the expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein in THP-1 cells following exposure to piliated S. typhi .

PKC activity in differentiated THP-1 cells is stimulated by the piliated S. typhi
To demonstrate the involvement of type IVB pili in the induction of the PKC activity after the interactions between human macrophages and S. typhi , differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with different amounts of piliated or nonpiliated strains , respectively . 
THP-1 cells without infection were used as a negative control . 
Results revealed that the PKC activities were signiﬁcantly stimulated ( Po0 :01 ) in differentiated THP-1 cells infected with piliated Typhi strain than that of cells infected with nonpiliated strain ( Fig. 3A and B ) . 
The PKC activities were further monitored by determining the ability of phosphorylation over 120 min after infection . 
Results indicated that phosphorylated bands from the piliated S. typhi infected cells were much stronger than that of cells infected with the nonpiliated Typhi strain at each time point indicated ( Fig. 3C and D ) . 
In addition , PKC activity elicited by the piliated Typhi strain in differentiated THP-1 cells was time-dependent , while that elicited by the nonpiliated Typhi strain was not . 
PKC activity was increased as early as 10 min post-infection , reached a maximal value at 30 min , and then declined ( Fig. 3C and D ) , while the basal level of PKC activity was very low when the THP-1 cells were not infected with bacteria ( Fig. 3E ) . 
These results suggest that the type IVB pili had an enhancement effect on PKC activity in THP-1 cells following exposure to S. typhi . 
The PKC inhibitor DECA inhibits both PKC activities and IL-6 production
Differentiated THP-1 cells were pre-treated with the PKC inhibitor DECA ( 15 mM for 120 min ) and then infected with piliated S. typhi at a ratio of bacteria to cells of 10:1 . 
Results showed that DECA treatment caused a signiﬁcant reduction of both PKC activity ( Figs. 3F , 4A , and 4B ) and IL-6 production ( Fig. 4C ) . 
In addition , DECA treatment had similar effects at different time points in differentiated THP-1 cells infected with piliated Typhi bacteria A21-6 ( Fig. 4B ) . 
DECA treatment also inhibited IL-6 release in THP-1 cells infected with nonpiliated S. typhi ( Fig. 4D ) . 
The data indicated that the production of IL-6 induced by piliated S. typhi was dependent on the PKC signal pathway . 
Type IVB piliated S. typhi induces NF-jB activity
To determine the effects of type IVB pili on NF-kB activity in the interactions between human macrophages and S. typhi bacteria , THP-1 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct ( controlled by an NF-kB-dependent promoter ) and then challenged with either piliated or nonpiliated Typhi strains for 2 h. Results showed that both piliated and nonpiliated Typhi strains stimulated the level of luciferase activity compared to the negative control ( Fig. 5A ) . 
However , the level of luciferase activity induced in THP-1 cells infected with piliated Typhi at the ratio of bacteria to human cells as 1:1 and 10:1 was higher than that in THP-1 cells infected with the equal amounts of nonpiliated Typhi ( Po0 :05 ) ( Fig. 5A ) 
NF-kB activity was further monitored in THP-1 cells after transfection with the reporter gene and infection with piliated or nonpiliated Typhi strains over time . 
Results showed that luciferase activity was rapidly increased after transfected THP-1 cells were infected with either piliated or nonpiliated Typhi ( Fig. 5B ) . 
The increase in luciferase activity was evident as early as 1 h post-infection , reached a peak at 2 h , declined at 4 h , and stayed at pre-infection levels after 4 h. Both piliated and nonpiliated S. typhi strains displayed a similar increase in luciferase activity during a consecutive 4 h period . 
However , the levels of luciferase activities were increased much higher in piliated S. typhi infected cells compared to that in nonpiliated S. typhi infected cells for the different time points as indicated , especially at 2 h. Basal levels of luciferase activity were very low when the transfected THP-1 cells were not infected with bacteria . 
These results suggest that type IVB pili play a important role in the induction of the NF-kB activity in THP-1 cells following exposure to piliated S. typhi . 
We also examined whether the PKC-mediated signaling pathway was involved in the induction of the NF-kB activity stimulated by the piliated S. typhi in THP-1 cells . 
Transfected cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitor DECA for 120 min prior to stimulation with piliated S. typhi . 
Results showed that luciferase activity in DECA pretreated cells was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to that in unpretreated cells ( Fig. 5B ) . 
The results suggest PKC inhibitor DECA inhibited the type IVB pili-mediated NF-kB activation in THP-1 cells following exposure to piliated S. typhi and that PKC was involved in the activation of NF-kB induced by the type IVB piliated strain .

ERK activity in differentiated THP-1 cells is stimulated by piliated S. typhi
Since the IL-6 promoter contains an AP-1 binding site , it was suggested that IL-6 induced gene expression may also be mediated by ERKs , p38 MAPK , and AP-1 pathways ( Dai et al. , 2004 ) . 
Our experimental results show that ERK activities were much higher in piliated S. typhi infected cells compared to that in nonpiliate

ERK activities reached a peak at 60 min , which was later than the time ( 30 min ) when PKC reached a peak ( Fig. 3B ) . 
In addition to the PKC-NF-kB pathway , type IVB pili of S. typhi may possibly be involved in the alternative ERK , NF-kB and / or AP-1 , or PKC-ERK-NF-kB and/or AP-1 signal pathways ( Fig. 7 ) . 
However , the detailed mechanism of how type IVB pili of S. typhi regulates ERK-AP-1 and/or NF-kB signal pathways still needs to be further investigated .

Discussion
Bacterial infection is a common pathological process in clinical conditions , which affects not only the disease loci , but also induces systemic inﬂammation . 
The amount of related cytokines released by local tissue is helpful in host defense against pathogen attack and tissue repair , but the great amount of cytokines released in a short time and the resultant inﬂammation cascade may lead to severe pathological injury . 
It is generally believed that TNF-a , IL-1 , and IL-6 are the main intrinsic mediators of pathologica damage . 
TNF-a/IL -6 level is considered as a marker of cytokine cascade initiation and its severity in systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) ( Ciacci-Woolwine et al. , 1998 ; DiMango et al. , 1998 ; Weinstein et al. , 1997 ) . 
Many studies have demonstrated that cytokines are released in response of several bacterial factors including membrane proteins by activating PKC-NF-kB and/orAP -1 pathway ( Kim and Rikihisa , 2002 ; Vielma et al. , 2003 ) . 
However , whether the newly described type IVB pili encoded by the pathogenicity island of S. typhi is involved in signal transduction in infected monocytes/macrophages remains undeﬁned . 
In this paper , we used human monocyte leukemia cell line THP-1 to study the induction of IL-6 by type IVB piliated S. typhi . 
Our data indicate that the type IVB pili have strong effects on the production of proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-6 in both THP-1 and PBMCs and can enhance the secretion of IL-6 . 
The basal level of IL-6 production with the nonpiliated S. typhi might be due to other virulence factors , i.e. ﬂagella or LPS . 
For example , ﬂagellin from P. aeruginosa activates NF-kB , transcriptional expression and subsequently induces the secretion of TNF-a , IL-6 and IL -- 8 ( DiMango et al. , 1998 ) . 
Our results indicate that the type IVB pilus is an important stimulator in inducing IL-6 production in bacterial-infected monocytes/macrophages . 
However , higher amounts of bacteria ( bacteria : cells430 :1 ) induce a lower level of IL-6 released in both THP-1 and PBMCs when the time of incubation was more than 30 min . 
One of the explanations for this observation is that many of the infected human cells were triggered to apopotosis by high concentrations of bacteria and long-term incubation , and resulted in a reduction of total protein synthesis . 
PKC , as an important signal transduction molecule , is related to many biological events . 
As a key enzyme in signal transduction systems , it responds to external signals by catalyzing the phosphorylation of multiple target proteins ( Shapira et al. , 1994 ; Kontny et al. , 1999 ; Galdiero et al. , 2002 ) . 
To determine whether type IVB pili , as an extra-cellular stimulator , affect the activity of PKC , we performed the experiments in this study . 
Our results show that the type IVB pilus is an important player in the activity change of PKC in bacteria-infected monocytes/macrophages , and that the PKC-dependent pathway takes part in the intracellular signal transduction process of IVB piliated Typhi strain-induced IL-6 production . 
NF-kB is a polypotent nuclear factor . 
As a constitutive nuclear factor , it maintains a low transcription level in tissue cells and plays a key role in the development and execution of normal immune activity of immune cells . 
As an induced nuclear factor , injury or micro-organism infection can lead to an abnormal increase in

NF-kB activity , resulting in the over-release of proin-ﬂammatory cytokines , and severe immune pathological injury ( Li and Verma , 2002 ) . 
Can type IVB pili lead to over activation of NF-kB ? 
To address this question , we used the luciferase gene under the control of the NF-kB promoter as a reporter to determine the effects of a type IVB piliated Typhi strain on the expression of NF-kB . 
Results from this study demonstrated that type IVB piliated Typhi strain signiﬁcantly activates NF-kB expression as a strong stimulator in bacteria-infected monocytes/macrophages . 
We also observed that the activity of the NF-kB promoter was slightly decreased by piliated Typhi when the ratio of bacteria to human cells was 30:1 . 
This might be due to many of the infected cells being triggered to damage or apoptosis when higher concentrations of bacteria were presented and total protein synthesis was reduced . 
Phosphorylation of PKC leads to its dissociation from NF-kB , which then enters the nucleus and binds speciﬁc sequences in the promoter regions of target genes ( Ogata et al. , 2000 ; Vitiello et al. , 2004 ) . 
Considering the results that PKC and NF-kB activity reached a peak 30 min and 120 min after infection with bacteria , respectively , and the order of PKC and NF-kB function in the signal transduction pathway , we suggest that the type IVB pili lead to pathological injury by activating the PKC-NF-kB signal pathway . 
We observed that nonpiliated S. typhi could also induce the release of IL-6 and increase NF-kB activity , although PKC was not activated . 
This effect might be due to cytokine release in response to other bacterial factors , including lipopo-lysaccharide through mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and NF-kB and/or AP-1 cascades ( Dai et al. , 2004 ; Vitiello et al. , 2004 ) . 
It has been suggested that IL-6 induced gene expression may also be mediated by ERKs and p38 MAPK and AP-1 and/or NF-kB pathways ( Walter et al. , 2004 ) . 
Our results demonstrate that ERK activities were much higher in piliated S. typhi infected cells compared to that in nonpiliated S. typhi infected cells . 
Therefore , it is possible that the type IVB pili of S. typhi is involved in an alternative ERK-AP-1 and/or NF-kB signal pathway . 
In summary , our data demonstrate that ( 1 ) type IVB piliated S. typhi can activate the PKC-NF-kB signal pathway , and ( 2 ) the type IVB pili of S. typhi might play an important role in the production of IL-6 and activation of NF-kB in bacteria-infected monocytes / macrophages and therefore may be involved in the development of fever and other inﬂammatory response syndromes .
