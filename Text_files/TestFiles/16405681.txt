Aims : To compare genetic composition of plasmids using microarrays composed of randomly selected fragments of plasmid DNA . 
Methods and Results : Separate shotgun libraries were constructed from plasmid DNA pooled from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica . 
Cloned fragments were used as probes for microarrays . 
Plasmid targets were labelled , hybridized overnight , and bound targets were imaged after enzymatic signal ampliﬁcation . 
Control hybridizations demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher signal when probes and targets shared > 95 % sequence identity . 
Diagnostic sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the assay was 95 and 99 % , respectively . 
Cluster analysis showed close matches for replicate experiments with a high correlation between replicates ( r = 0Æ91 ) compared with the correlation for nonreplicates ( r = 0Æ09 ) . 
Analysis of hybridization data from 43 plasmids generated ﬁve distinct clusters , two for known serovar-speciﬁc plasmids , one for enterohemorrhagic E. coli plasmids , and two for plasmids harboring a recently disseminated antibiotic resistance gene ( blaCMY-2 ) . 
Conclusion : Mixed-plasmid microarrays are suitable for comparing genetic content of wild-type plasmids and hybridization results from this study suggest several novel hypotheses about plasmid gene exchange between E. coli and S. enterica .

Introduction
Signiﬁcance and Impact of Study : Mixed-plasmid microarrays permit rapid , low cost analysis and comparison of many plasmids . 
This ability is critical to understanding the source , fate , and transport of plasmids amongst commensal and pathogenic bacteria . 
Plasmids are mobile , self-replicating genetic elements that are distinct from bacterial chromosomes . 
Although plasmids usually comprise only a small percentage of total cellular DNA , plasmids may encompass up to 30 % or more of the genetic diversity in a given gene pool ( Tho-mas 2000 ) . 
Plasmids are ` mosaic ' in composition and as such they are composed of genes derived from many sources ( Boyd et al. 1996 ; Osborn et al. 2000 ; Tauch et al. 2000 ; Böltner et al. 2002 ; Osborn and Boltner 2002 ; González et al. 2003 ; Maeda et al. 2003 ; Nelson et al. 2004 ) . 
This mosaic includes a ` plasmid backbone ' plus accessory genes ( Osborn et al. 2000 ) . 
Backbone genes include plasmid replication and transfer functions while accessory genes confer traits such as resistance to antimicrobials , virulence , and selective advantage within speciﬁc niches including host animals and plants ( Eberhard 1989 ; Tauch et al. 2002 ) . 
Despite the potential importance of plasmids to medicine , industry , agriculture , and animal welfare , we have a very incomplete understanding of the composition , source , fate , and dissemination of most plasmids in natural systems . 
Better analytical systems are needed to understand the molecular epidemiology of plasmids . 
Despite our limited knowledge of plasmid content , considerable effort has demonstrated that intra - and inter-speciﬁc plasmid transfer occurs in different soil and aquatic environments ( van Elsas et al. 2000 ; Bushman 2002 ) . 
These studies have identiﬁed a range of physical and biological conditions that contribute to successful transfer of plasmids , with nutrient rich environments being potential transfer hotspots . 
Analysis of the distribution of speciﬁc antibiotic resistance genes , including erythromycin ( ermF , ermG ) and tetracycline resistance genes [ tet ( M ) , tet ( K ) , tet ( L ) , and tet ( Q ) ] within and between bacterial species suggests that there is stable transfer of these genes across a broad host-range ( Salyers and Amábile - Cuevas 1997 ; Shoemaker et al. 2001 ) . 
After transfer of plasmids across the species boundary , portions of the plasmids can then recombine to form novel plasmids in the new host ( Charpentier et al. 1999 ) . 
Recombination of plasmid DNA and transfer of plasmids between species represent signiﬁcant challenges to molecular epidemiologists who study the source , fate , and mechanisms of plasmid gene dissemination . 
Unfortunately , the most commonly used tools in plasmid research are inadequate for describing the composition of plasmids much less their dissemination within and between bacter-ial species . 
While tools such as phenotypic characterization , physical characterization using restriction enzymes , plasmid proﬁling , incompatibility grouping , and replicon typing provide important information about some plasmid features or functions , all of these methods lack the breadth needed to address basic questions about plasmid epidemiology , particularly at the level of recombination events and accessory gene content and function ( Smalla et al. 2000 ) . 
Whole plasmid sequencing offers the means to most clearly identify disseminated plasmid sequences , but ﬁnancial and logistical constraints limit the number of plasmids that can be sequenced ; whole plasmid sequen-cing is not yet practical for the investigation of large numbers of plasmids that would be needed for epidemiological studies . 
Given the practical limitations of whole plasmid sequencing , an alternative strategy would be to focus on sequence variation of one or more gene sequences that are shared amongst all plasmids . 
There are , however , no ` unifying ' genetic elements analogous to the chromosomal rDNA gene for studying the identity and phylogeny of plasmids . 
One logical alternative is to track the distribution of speciﬁc genes . 
An obvious extension of this approach is to scale-up the procedure to simultaneously screen for many genes in a single assay . 
In this paper , we describe such an approach using a ` mixed-plasmid ' DNA an aggregate correlation based on the presence or absence of a large number of probe sequences rather than weighting any single sequence more than any other . 
The goal of this analysis is to compare the genetic content between plasmids based on a subset of randomly selected DNA fragments . 
Analysis of plasmids from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica show that the method is repeatable and capable of discriminating serovar/serotype-speci ﬁc virulence plasmids . 
We also use this tool to describe gen-etic similarity between plasmids that harbor a recently disseminated gene , blaCMY-2 , that confers resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins . 
Materials and methods
Plasmid size and antibiotic susceptibility
All plasmid sizes were estimated using methods from Kado and Lui ( 1981 ) . 
Our electrophoresis conditions included 1 % ( w v ) agarose gels run at 0Æ6 V cm , 4 h , ) 1 ) 2 in TAE buffer ( 40 mmol l Tris-acetate , 1 mmol l ) 1 ) 1 EDTA ) . 
The size of larger and smaller plasmids was estimated relative to a BAC-Tracker Supercoiled DNA ladder ( EPICENTRE Biotechnologies , Madison , WI , USA ) and with a Supercoiled DNA ladder ( Invitrogen Corp. , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , respectively . 
Plasmid sizes ( kbp ) were estimated relative to the size standards using Bionumerics 
software ( Applied Maths , Austin , TX , USA ) . 
Phage typing for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was provided by the National Laboratory for Enteric Patho-gens , Health Canada ( Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) . 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using an agar diffusion assay ( NCCLS 2003 ) with the following antimicrobial disks ( all from Becton , Dickinson and Company , Sparks , MD , USA ) : ampicillin ( 10 lg ) , chloramphenicol ( 30 lg ) , gentamicin ( 120 lg ) , kanamycin ( 30 lg ) , nitrofurantoin ( 300 lg ) , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( 1Æ25 and 23Æ75 lg , respectively ) , streptomycin ( 300 lg ) , tetracycline ( 30 lg ) , triple-sulfa ( 250 lg ) , ciproﬂoxacin ( 5 lg ) , and ceftazidime ( 30 lg ) . 
Presence of a blaCMY-2 gene was conﬁrmed using a previously published PCR protocol ( Zhao et al. 2001 ) . 
Presence of genes speciﬁc to Salmonella virulence plasmids ( parBS , spvRA , spvC , repA ) were detected using primers and protocols from Chu et al. ( 1999 ) . 
Classiﬁcation of blaCMY-2 elements followed the PCR-based scheme described by Giles et al. ( 2004 ) . 
Library construction
Isolates of plasmid bearing E. coli ( n = 11 ) and S. enterica ( serovars Typhimurium n = 2 , Newport n = 4 , Dublin n = 2 , Heidelberg n = 1 , Muenster n = 1 , and group B untyped n = 1 ) were selected from a bank of human and bovine isolates that is maintained by the Field Disease Investigation Unit at Washington State University ( Pullman , WA , USA ) . 
Strains were selected based on distinctive multi-drug resistance patterns and based on the presence of at least one large plasmid ( > 25 kbp ) as assessed by plasmid proﬁles . 
The average plasmid size for E. coli and S. enterica isolates was 103 and 138 kbp , respectively and the average number of plasmids per isolate was 2Æ1 ( SD = 0Æ8 ) and 1Æ5 ( SD = 0Æ5 ) , respectively . 
The E. coli isolates used to prepare the plasmid libraries were originally collected from cattle in 2002 ; four of the isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility or resistance to the extended spectrum cephalosporin , ceftazidime . 
Overall , the 11 E. coli isolates used for library construction were resistant to between one ( n = 1 ) and nine anti-microbials ( n = 4 ) . 
S. enterica isolates were collected between 1988 and 2002 from humans , cattle , and a dog . 
Four isolates were resistant to ceftazidime . 
Overall , S. ent-erica isolates used for library construction were resistant to between zero ( n = 1 ) and nine antimicrobials ( n = 4 ) .

To construct shotgun libraries , large plasmids were isolated using a plasmid proﬁling protocol ( Kado and Lui 1981 ) followed by gel electrophoresis as described above except using a low-melting temperature agarose . 
The gel region between the loading well and excluding all material at or below the 23 kbp region of the gel ( assessed using a lambda-HindIII ladder , Invitrogen ) was excised and plasmid DNA was extracted using b-Agarase I ( New England BioLabs , INC , Beverly , MA , USA ) . 
Aliquots of each plasmid ( ca. 500 ng each ) were pooled by species of origin and fragmented by sonication ( Misonix Inc. , Farmingdale , NY , USA ) . 
Fragmented DNA was then size-separated by gel electrophoresis and DNA between 500 and 800 bp was excised and extracted as described above . 
From each spe-cies of origin , plasmid fragments were separately cloned using a pCR 4Blunt-TOPO cloning kit following manufacturer recommendations ( Invitrogen ) . 
Host E. coli harboring cloned fragments were arrayed into 96-well plates , grown to stationary phase in LB broth , and stored in 20 % ( v v ) glycerol freezing media at ) 1 ) 80 C. Plasmids were isolated from overnight culture using a 96-well plasmid puriﬁcation kit ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3Æ1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . 
Final sequencing reactions were analysed using an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer ( Applied Biosystems ) and sequence traces were processed using Vector NTI software ( Invitrogen ) . 
Image analysis 
Microarray construction
In this study we deﬁned the DNA placed on the glass slide as the ` probe ' and DNA hybridized to the micro-array as the ` target ' . 
Cloning vector primers ( T7 and T3 ) were used to amplify cloned inserts in 50 ll PCR reactions following previously described procedures ( Borucki et al. 2003 ; Call et al. 2003b ) . 
PCR products were then puriﬁed by isopropanol precipitation ( Sambrook et al. 1989 ) and were re-suspended in 22 ll H2O . 
A small ali-quot ( 2 ll ) was gel checked using a 1 % ( w v ) 1 ) agarose gel . 
The remaining 20 ll was combined with 12Æ5 ll 4 · print buffer ( 0Æ4 mol l ) 1 Na ) 1 2HPO4 , 0Æ8 mol l NaCl , 0Æ04 % SDS ; pH 11Æ6 ) and 17Æ5 ll H2O . 
PCR products ( ` probes ' ) were subsequently deposited as quadruplicate spots ( ca. 225 lm diameter ) on positively charged immu-nohistochemistry slides ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) using a BioRobotics MicroGrid II arrayer ( Genomic Solutions , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) . 
Arrays were printed in four equal sized quadrants , with each quadrant including four additional spots of a biotinylated oligonucleotide ( 25-mer , arbitrary sequence ) that served to orient the array for image analysis and as a positive control for the 
Plasmid hybridization
Plasmids targets were isolated by plasmid proﬁling and extraction from agarose gels as described above or by using a plasmid miniprep kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) . 
Following the methods of Call et al. ( 2003a , b ) ) , plasmid DNA ( 100 ng ) was biotinylated using nick translation ( Bio-Nick kit , Invitrogen ) and after ethanol precipitation ( Sambrook et al. 1989 ) the labelled DNA was re-suspended in 1 · hybridization buffer [ 80 ll ; 4 · SSC ( 0Æ6 mol l ) 1 NaCl , 0Æ6 mol l ) 1 Na citrate ) , 5X Denhardt 's solution ( 10 mol l ) 1 Ficoll , 10 mol l polyvinylpyrrolidone , 10 mol l BSA ) ] ) 1 ) 1 and transferred to a microarray slide where the solution was covered with a lifter coverslip ( Erie Scientiﬁc , Ports-mouth , NH , USA ) . 
Slides were placed in hybridization chambers ( Corning , Acton , MA , USA ) and maintained in a water bath overnight at 55 C. Hybridized DNA was secondarily detected using a combination of Tyramide Signal Ampliﬁcation ( PerkinElmer , Foster City , CA , USA ) and TM Alexa Fluor 546 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . 
Slides were subsequently scanned using an arrayWoRx eTM scanner ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) . 
TIF image ﬁles were analyzed using softWoRx image TM analysis software ( Applied Precision ) using the contour option that accommodates spots that have varying shape and size . 
Median spot intensity data was subsequently transferred to a custom relational database ( Access , Microsoft Corp , Redmond , WA , USA ) and median values were averaged for all replicate spots . 
Normalization of microarray data is often accomplished by dividing all intensity values by the average intensity for one or more ` housekeeping genes ' or by divi-ding by the average intensity across all probes ( global normalization ) . 
The former is not possible with plasmids because there are no conserved sequences available for this purpose . 
Global normalization will not work well because there can be wide variation in the numbers of positive probes ( 5 to 100 + ) for different plasmid hybridi-zations . 
Consequently , we arbitrarily selected 25 000 intensity units ( intensity units range from 0 to 65 535 ) as a threshold for potentially positive probes . 
For each quadrant of the microarray we determined the average intensity of all probes with intensity values > 25 000 and then divided each probe intensity value by this average in order to normalize probe intensities for that quadrant . 
This was repeated for all quadrants for all hybridization experiments . 
We used a Ward 's minimum variance cluster algorithm ( NCSS 2004 , Kaysville , UT , USA ) to examine the genetic similarity between plasmids . 
A Euclidean distance metric was used to construct the distance matrix and values within the matrix were normalized by dividing by the standard deviation for each probe across all hybridization experiments . 
All statistical tests were conducted using NCSS 2004 . 
recognizable homologues ( Table 1 ) . 
Sequence analysis
Probes were putatively identiﬁed by examination of e-scores from BLASTx or BLASTn queries ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ ) ( Gish and States 1993 ) where values # 10 ) 3 were considered signiﬁcant . 
We grouped probes into four functional classes . 
Backbone genes included probe sequences homologous to genes required for plasmid replication , maintenance , and transfer . 
Horizontal transfer genes included homologues for transposons , integrons , and phage sequences . 
Accessory genes included antibiotic resistance genes , virulence factors , and metabolic functions . 
All genes with e-scores > 10 were classiﬁed as unknown . 
Probes were also com - ) 3 pared with the LT2 plasmid sequence ( Genbank 
NC_003277 ) to assess percent sequence identity . 
BLASTn was used for preliminary identiﬁcation of related probes and Vector NTI software was used to calculate percent similarity . 
Results
Mixed-plasmid libraries
We arbitrarily selected 288 clones each from E. coli and S. enterica mixed-plasmid libraries to produce microarrays ( see below ) and we were able to recover sequences for 96Æ2 and 99 % of clones from the E. coli and S. enterica libraries , respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
The distribution of backbone and accessory homologues was similar in the two libraries ( ca. 31Æ8 and 17 % , respectively ) . 
The E. coli plasmid library had more homologues for horizontal elements but this may represent an identiﬁcation bias because the S. enterica plasmid library had more probes that lacked 
We used all 576 clone inserts to construct microarrays with the recognition that some probes would represent overlapping regions of DNA . 
Thus , we compared plasmid sequences from each library to identify duplicate or conti-guous sequences ( ` contigs ' ) . 
The E. coli library included 60 contigs composed of an average 2Æ3 probe sequences ( SD = 0Æ8 probe sequences ) . 
The S. enterica library inclu-ded 47 contigs and with the exception of one case , contigs averaged 2Æ5 probe sequences ( SD = 0Æ7 ) . 
The exception was a 2710 bp contig that had 25 overlapping probe sequences . 
None of the 25 probe sequences compri-sing this contig had functional homologues when compared to GenBank . 
With the exception of the LT2 plasmid experiments described below , for all other analyses we averaged probe signal for all members of each contig and treated each contig as an independent unit and thereby avoided bias from inclusion of redundant probes in the analysis . 
We also eliminated all probes and contigs from further analysis if the maximum signal intensity across all hybridization experiments was less than 10 000 ( range 0 -- 65 535 ) . 
These latter probes were considered uninformative in our analysis . 
Probes ( n = 237 ) or contigs ( n = 103 ) included in subsequent analyses were distributed equally between the E. coli library and S. enterica libraries ( 47Æ1 and 52Æ9 % , respectively , v2 = 1Æ2 , 1 df , P = 0Æ28 ) .

LT2 plasmid hybridization
We compared the sequence of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence associated plasmid ( LT2 ) with probe sequences . 
BLASTn queries indicated that there were 37 probe sequences with moderate to high sequence similarity with the plasmid ( Genbank AE006471 ) . 
Thus , we judged that hybridizing the LT2 plasmid to our microarray would allow us to assess the accuracy of our interpretation of microarray hybridization results . 
For this analysis , we treated each probe independent of any association with contigs , but we limited the analysis to the 499 probes that had intensity values of at least 10 000 for at least one of the 42 plasmid hybridization experiments described below . 
We examined signal intensity for the 499 probes using data from ﬁve replicate hybridizations of the S. enterica LT2 plasmid ( ATCC 19585 ) . 
Two of these hybridizations were conducted using half of the concentration that we normally use for plasmid DNA hybridizations and we included these data to introduce some variance that might be expected from experimental error . 
There was a clear correlation between percent LT2 sequence identity and the normalized signal intensity of the probes ( Fig. 1a ) . 
On average probes with > 95 % sequence identity to the LT2 plasmid had signiﬁcantly greater normalized signal intensity compared with probes with lower sequence identity ( P < 0Æ001 ; Student 's t-test ) ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Probes with 80 -- 95 % sequence identity with the LT2 plasmid generated probe intensities greater than probes that shared < 80 % sequence identity with the LT2 plasmid ( P < 0Æ001 ) ( Fig. 1a ) . 
We also plotted the signal intensity for all probes having > 70 % sequence identity with the LT2 sequence ( Fig. 1b ) and we selected 0Æ5 as an arbitrary threshold of normalized signal intensity for detecting positive hybrid-ization events . 
Based on this criteria the microarray correctly detected 35 sequences having a sequence identity > 95 % with the LT2 plasmid ( Fig. 1b ) . 
At this threshold there were two false negatives and three false positives . 
The remaining 431 probes ( not shown ) were negative as expected . 
Thus , for a threshold value of 0Æ5 and with rep-licated hybridizations , the array had a diagnostic sensitiv ¬

Bacterial isolates originated from between 1986 and 2002 and most were clinical isolates from either cattle or humans . 
Each isolate harbored one or more large plasmids as detected by plasmid proﬁling . 
Fourteen isolates exhibited resistance or reduced susceptibility to ceftazi-dime and all of these isolates were also positive for the blaCMY-2 gene based on PCR .

selected subset of 16 isolates , plasmids were prepared either by isolation and extraction after agarose electro-phoresis or as a standard mini-prep for a total of 42 hybridization experiments . 
Gel extracted plasmids inclu-ded all bands between the loading well down to , but excluding the 23 kbp and smaller region of the gel . 
In some cases this included multiple plasmids ( Table 2 , Fig. 2 ) . 
Mini-preps would be expected to include all plasmids , contaminating chromosomal DNA ( usually migra-ting in the vicinity of the 23 kbp region of a gel ) , and whatever material that would normally reside in the loading well , but not migrate during normal electrophoresis . 
Thus , gel extracted material was deemed more ` pure ' compared with mini-prep samples . 
Regardless of the DNA preparation method , however , all replicate plasmid hybridizations grouped proximally to each other by cluster analysis ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The average correlations ( r ) between replicates of gel-isolated plasmids ( n = 9 pair-wise comparisons ) , replicates of mini-prepped plasmids ( n = 15 comparisons ) , and replicates of gel-isolated vs mini-prep-ped plasmids ( n = 22 comparisons ) were 0Æ93 , 0Æ92 , and 0Æ89 , respectively . 
In contrast , the average correlation between nonreplicate hybridizations ( n = 815 ) was 0Æ09 . 
These data indicated that the assay was robust and that on average , plasmid mini-preps yielded data equivalent to data resulting from gel isolated plasmids .

How similar are E. coli and S. enterica plasmids?
For the 43 plasmid preparations described in Table 2 , we examined one slide and calculated the average probe intensity for all probes having intensity values > 25 000 . 
Average values for the 43 independent experiments were normally distributed ( based on seven different tests of normality provided by NCSS software ) and thus there were no obvious outliers in the analysis . 
On average , probes from the E. coli library had signiﬁcantly higher intensity for plasmid targets originating from E. coli hosts compared with plasmid targets originating from S. enterica hosts ( P < 0Æ0001 ; Student 's t-test ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In contrast , probes originating from the S. enterica library had similar probe signal intensity with plasmids originating from either E. coli or S. enterica hosts ( P < 0Æ45 ) . 
Another way to look at this question is to examine the fold-differences enterica ( open bars ) relative to the origin of the microarray probes ( E. coli library or S. enterica library ) . 
for signal intensity for plasmids matched to their respective libraries . 
For example , as shown in Fig. 3 , while E. coli origin plasmids had only 1Æ2-fold higher average signal intensity for E. coli library probes compared to Sal-monella library probes , Salmonella origin plasmids tended to have much higher average signal intensity with Sal-monella library probes : Serovars Dublin , Typhimurium , and Newport origin plasmids had 4Æ9-fold , 3Æ1-fold and 2Æ2-fold higher average signal intensity , respectively , for probes from the S. enterica library compared to E. coli

Figure 3 Average signal intensity for plasmids originating from Escherichia coli ( closed bars ) and plasmids originating from Salmonella 
library probes . 
When we adopted a threshold of 0Æ5 and above as a normalized signal intensity threshold indicating positive detection of a probe sequence , then there was considerable variation in the number of positive probes for the 43 plasmids ( range , 8 -- 134 positive probes per plasmid prep ) . 
Plasmids from E. coli appeared to be more ` cosmopol-itan ' , as four of the 13 plasmids scored a majority of S. enterica probes as positive ( 57 -- 80 % ) . 
Plasmids from S. enterica were much less likely to hybridize to probes from the E. coli library with only two plasmids out of 30 having a slight majority of E. coli probes indicated as positive [ ps2626 ( 56 % ) and ps2803 ( 55 % ) ] . 
Genetic similarity
We compared 43 plasmids based on signal intensity from 340 microarray probes or contigs ( Fig. 4 ) . 
There were ﬁve primary plasmid clusters of interest : serovar Dublin and Typhimurium plasmids ( one cluster each ) , EHEC plasmids ( one cluster ) , and blaCMY-2 bearing plasmids ( two clusters ) . 
All serovar Dublin plasmids grouped together along with one serovar Newport plasmid ( ps4872 ) . 
The majority of serovar Typhimurium plasmids ( 11 out of 15 ) clustered together and all of the plasmids in the Typhimurium cluster were PCR positive for all four of the serovar Typhimurium virulence plasmid loci ( parBS , repA , spvC , and spvRA ) . 
Two other serovar Typhimurium plasmids were also positive for all four virulence plasmid markers ( ps3872 and 3686 ) , but these plasmids were found outside the main serovar Typhimurium plasmid cluster and adjacent to two other serovar Typhimurium plasmids that harbored only the spvC marker ( ps2626 and 
2282 ) . 
Three of the four EHEC plasmids clustered closely . 
Plasmids harboring the blaCMY-2 gene were split into two clearly delineated clusters and only one blaCMY-2 positive plasmid ( ps7594 ) was clearly separated from the other 13 blaCMY-2 positive plasmids . 
The two primary blaCMY-2 clusters both included E. coli and S. enterica plasmids . 
The blaCMY-2 positive plasmids in cluster CMY-2_a inclu-ded three plasmids from E. coli hosts and ﬁve plasmids from S. enterica hosts . 
In all eight cases , the average normalized probe intensity for these plasmids was greater for probes originating from the S. enterica library ( avg = 0Æ22 ; SD = 0Æ05 ) compared with E. coli library ( avg = 0Æ09 ; SD = 0Æ07 ) ( P = 0Æ001 ; Student 's t-test ) . 
The ﬁve blaCMY-2 positive plasmids in cluster CMY-2_b ( one originating from S. enterica ) had approximately equal signal intensity for probes originating from the E. coli ( avg = 0Æ34 ; SD = 0Æ12 ) and S. enterica ( avg = 0Æ27 ; SD = 0Æ08 ) plasmid libraries ( P = 0Æ26 ) . 
We compared the average correlation in hybridization pattern between the LT2 plasmid and the ﬁve major plasmid clusters shown in Fig. 4 . 
Plasmids in the Typhimurium cluster were highly correlated ( r = 0Æ94 ) to LT2 and Dublin plasmids were moderately correlated ( r = 0Æ36 ) . 
Correlations with plasmids from the EHEC ( r = 0Æ22 ) , Cmy2_A ( r = 0Æ16 ) , and Cmy2_B ( r = 0Æ33 ) were variable . 
While the global cluster analysis probably reﬂects overall genetic similarity between plasmids , we surmised that backbone genes would provide more speciﬁc information associated with the type of plasmid being analyzed ( Fig. 5 ) . 
This analysis preserved the clearly delineated divisions for the Dublin cluster , the EHEC cluster , and the Cmy-2_A cluster , while the Cmy-2_B cluster gained one additional plasmid ( peSSuTet ) . 
The Typhimurium cluster expanded to include plasmids from all Typhimu-rium isolates except ps2626 and this cluster also gained one serovar Newport plasmid ( ps2803 ) and one EHEC related plasmid ( pe8905 ) .

library probes . 
PCR products from our 14 blaCMY-2 PCR-positive plasmids were sequenced to conﬁrm the presence of the blaCMY-2 gene ( data not shown ) . 
We also classiﬁed all 14 blaCMY-2 plasmids based on a PCR typing scheme des-cribed by Giles et al. ( 2004 ) and all 14 plasmids were positive for the ` type C ' PCR product . 
Within the two blaCMY-2 clusters , both serovar Newport ps7591 and ser-ovar Muenster ps7651 were positive for three of the Sal-monella virulence-associated plasmid genes ( parBS , spvRA , and spvC ) while the remaining serovar Newport plasmids were either negative for all four virulence-associated plasmid genes ( ps6615 ) or positive for the spvC marker only ( ps7594 , 7486 , 7658 and 6668 ) . 
If we adopt a normalized signal threshold of ‡ 0Æ5 as indicating positive detection , then blaCMY-2 plasmids scored positive signal for between 21 probes ( ps7594 ) and 134 probes ( pe1216rT ) . 
There were 21 probes present in at least 10 of the 13 blaCMY-2 positive plasmids compri-sing Cmy-2_a and Cmy-2_b groups ( Fig. 4 ) that were not present in any of the non-blaCMY-2 plasmids . 
Of these , two probes ( 4-F7 and 6-B2 ) sequences were exact matches with elements of the type C construct described by Giles et al. ( 2004 ) ( Fig. 6 ) and this included a fragment of the blaCMY-2 gene itself . 
Probe 5-E3 , a putative transposase , was positive for all 14 blaCMY-2 plasmids , but only the ﬁrst 70 % of the probe sequence matched the type C sequence perfectly , and the sequence down-stream from this discontinuity was unrelated to the type C sequence . 
A fourth contig ( Sal-9 ) , which was positive for only 10 of 14 blaCMY-2 plasmids , matched the type C sequence for the ﬁrst 39 % of the probe after which the probe sequence deviated signiﬁcantly from the type C sequence .

Discussion
This project is motivated by the need for a simple assay that can be used to sample the genetic content of plasmids and thereby provide an alternative to less informat-ive restriction mapping or much more time consuming and expensive whole plasmid sequencing . 
The mixed-plas-mid microarray described in this study was based on a collection of randomly selected gene fragments and as such it does not assess the entire content of individual plasmids as would be possible with whole plasmid sequencing . 
Nevertheless , assuming that there is no bias

in the original plasmid libraries , then the microarray permits a random survey of the genetic content of multiple plasmids . 
Our validation tests with the LT2 plasmid indicated a reasonable level of speciﬁcity and sensitivity ( 99 and 95 % , respectively ) . 
There were two probes that produced false negatives for these tests ( probes 6-G7 and 6-H8 ) and because these probe spots were positive for other plasmids , their absence with the LT2 hybridization can not be explained by a complete printing failure . 
One of the probes ( 6-H8 ) formed an overlapping contig with another probe that was clearly positive for the LT2 hybridization ( 5-C8 ) . 
This indicates that either the wrong PCR product was printed for the 6-H8 probe location and this produced the appearance of a false negative , or the pin did not print on all slides . 
We carefully examined the probe sequences for the three false positive probes and found no signiﬁcant homology with the LT2 plasmid or the ser-ovar Typhimurium genome sequence . 
In these cases , the most likely explanation for the false positives is that the wrong PCR product was printed ( e.g. , through template contamination when the probes were generated by PCR ) .

Probes Sal-9 and 5-E3 match 100 % for only a portion of the 5-prime region of the probe ( 39Æ4 and 
By sequencing the cloned inserts we were able to assign probes to broad functional classes . 
From this we showed that plasmids from both E. coli and S. enterica were composed of approximately 33 % backbone genes , which is similar to the percentage of backbone genes reported for pSLT from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ( 38 % ) ( McClelland et al. 2001 ) . 
Plasmids from E. coli hybridized somewhat more frequently to probes from the E. coli lib-rary , but these plasmids still hybridized frequently to probes from the S. enterica library . 
These data suggest that the wild-type E. coli isolates will harbor a diverse collection of plasmids , including some that have more in common with the Salmonella plasmid gene pool than the E. coli plasmid gene pool . 
Salmonella plasmids , in contrast , were much less likely to hybridize to a signiﬁcant number of E. coli plasmid probes . 
This is probably due to our focus on three serovars of S. enterica where Dublin and Typhimurium isolates are expected to be dominated by serovar speciﬁc virulence plasmids . 
The correlation between probe intensity for all E. coli plasmids vs S. ent-erica plasmids indicated that the former shared more probes with serovar Newport ( r = 0Æ56 ) compared with other serovars ( r < 0 for Typhimurium and Dublin plasmids ) . 
Nevertheless , even plasmids from much more cosmopolitan serovar Newport isolates were more likely to hybridize to probes from the Salmonella library . 
This tendency is consistent with novel hypotheses about plasmid gene exchange , for example that plasmid gene ﬂow may occur more frequently from Salmonella to E. coli than in the reverse direction ; that E. coli plasmid genes horizontally transferred to Salmonella are not stably maintained in that genus or that Salmonella serotype-speciﬁc virulence plasmids are refractory to incorporation of exogen-ous genes . 
These hypotheses represent examples of the value of the mixed-plasmid array in the study of the molecular epidemiology of plasmids . 
Plasmid groups
The mixed-plasmid microarray clearly discriminated the Salmonella serovar-speciﬁc virulence-associated plasmids included in the study ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) . 
All plasmids associated with S. enterica serovar Dublin grouped together and all plasmids from serovar Typhimurium that were also PCR positive for all four of the Salmonella virulence-asso-ciated plasmid genes grouped together . 
There was some variation in branch length between plasmids and this probably represents , at least in part , natural genetic variation between serovar speciﬁc plasmids as has been documented in previous studies ( Browning et al. 1995 ; Chu et al. 2001 ) . 
Indeed , despite the fact that the serovar Typhimurium speciﬁc virulence-associated plasmid is thought to be ancestral to the serovar Dublin plasmid 
( Rodriguez et al. 1997 ; Chu et al. 1999 ) , there was no dif-ﬁculty discerning differences between plasmids from these two serovars . 
Most serovar Typhimurium plasmids bearing all four virulence loci ( parBS , repA , spvC , and spvRA ) grouped proximally in both dendrograms ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) . 
Two exceptions were ps3872 and ps3686 originating from phage type u302 and 104 isolates , respectively . 
Two very distinct hybridization patterns were evident for ps2282 ( phage type 193 ) and ps2626 ( phage type 132 ) . 
These latter plasmids were only positive for one of the virulence plasmid markers ( spvC ) consistent with reports that not all serovar Typhimurium isolates harbor the serovar spe-ciﬁc virulence plasmids ( Chiu et al. 1999 ) . 
These latter isolates also had unusual plasmid proﬁles compared with other Typhimurium isolates ( ps2282 , 189 kbp ; ps2626 , 89 and 66 kbp ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Newport does not have an associated serovar speciﬁc plasmid and plasmids from this serovar were quite variable . 
For example , ps4872 grouped closely with plasmids from serovar Dublin and the plasmid from ps6615 was PCR positive for all four serovar Typhimurium virulence-associated markers . 
Plasmid ps7591 was positive for three makers ( parBS , spvC , and spvRA ) , and ps7594 , 7486 , 7658 , and 6668 were positive for only spvC . 
Plasmid ps2803 was negative for all four virulence-associated markers . 
Our analysis included plasmids from three enterohemorrhagic E. coli isolates ( O26 : H ? 
, O26 : H11 , O157 : H7 ; all eaeA and stx positive ) . 
Plasmids from two O157 : H7 , including a bovine isolate and a human outbreak isolate , and one O26 : H ? 
bovine isolate grouped together ( pe200 , 8802 , and 239 ) whereas a serotype O26 : H11 human outbreak plasmid ( pe8905 ) was distinctly different ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) . 
Plasmid peSSuT , while apparently sharing a plasmid backbone composition similar to the blaCMY-2 plasmids , appeared to carry a very distinct mosaic of accessory gene sequences . 
This particular plasmid may harbor genes that confer selective advantage to E. coli that grow well in young dairy calves ( Khachatryan et al. 2004 ) . 
All of the S. enterica plasmids that were positive for blaCMY-2 gene were from either serovar Newport ( n = 6 ) or serovar Muenster ( n = 1 ) . 
Increasing numbers of infections with closely related or identical strains of blaCMY-2 positive serovar S. enterica serovar Newport have been reported in recent years ( Zhao et al. 2003 ; Berge et al. 2004 ) and this serovar has emerged as the third most important source of human salmonellosis in the United States ( CDC 2002 ) . 
Intra - and inter-speciﬁc plasmid transfer probably contributes to dissemination of the blaCMY-2 gene . 
Data from Figs. 4 and 5 support the presence of two blaCMY-2 plasmid groups dominated by either E. coli or S. enterica . 
Importantly , both clusters include plasmids from both host species , which is consistent with inter-generic movement of blaCMY-2 positive plasmids . 
Genetic diversity within clusters is variable ( judged by relative branch length ) , which is consistent with intergeneric movement of plasmids and it is consistent with horizontal movement of a putative blaCMY-2 bearing element ( e.g. , transposon ) between distinct plasmids . 
bla plasmids CMY-2 
The blaCMY-2 gene is thought to have originally mobil-ized from the chromosome of Citrobacter freundii ( Bauernfeind et al. 1996 ) . 
We identiﬁed 21 probes that hybridized with at least 10 of the 13 blaCMY-2 positive plasmids comprising the two main Cmy-2 groups ( Fig. 5 ) , but these probes did not hybridize to any of the blaCMY-2 negative plasmids . 
Most of the probe sequences had no matches with BLASTn queries . 
Six probes had very close matches to known sequences with one probe originating from the E. coli library ( 2-C6 ) mostly overlapping a putative transposase from the S. enterica library ( 5-E3 ) . 
Most blaCMY-2 PCR positive plasmids were posit-ive for this transposase , and a fragment of the blaCMY-2 gene itself , and two other gene fragments aligned with the type C fragment reported by Giles et al. ( 2004 ) ( Fig. 6 ) . 
BLASTx queries indicated that ﬁve other probes had high homology to ORF 131 and 136 from pCAR1 . 
Plasmid pCAR1 was originally isolated from a soil micro-organism ( Pseudomonas resinovorans ) and the plasmid harbors a large catabolic transposon ( Tn4676 ) ( Maeda et al. 2003 ) . 
Neither ORF131 nor ORF136 are part of the Tn4676 element found on pCAR1 . 
Three of the probe sequences formed an overlapping contiguous sequence ca. 1057 bp in length with high homology to a micrococcal nuclease that has been annotated for the Azotobacter vine-landii genome project ( Genbank ZP_00092900 and ZP_00090394 ) . 
Remaining probe sequences included a putative protein regulator with high homology to the multi-drug resistance region of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 . 
We also found traD and traK homologs indicating that these plasmids are potentially conjugative . 
Work is currently underway to identify the full sequence of the putative blaCMY-2 transposon by using PCR to span potential gaps between probe sequences that are highly correlated and exclusive to the blaCMY-2 positive plasmids . 
Designing mixed-plasmid microarrays
Mixed-plasmid microarrays are relatively simple to construct and use , but given the tremendous potential for genetic variation in plasmid gene pools , the arrays are necessarily limited by the extent of genetic diversity that is represented . 
There are no guidelines for the ideal number of plasmids to be incorporated into the library or for how many sequences should be incorporated into the microarray . 
Recognized genes , such as replicon sequences , could be used to augment mixed-plasmid microarrays ( Carattoli et al. 2005 ) . 
Given the nature of the library construction ( randomly fragmented DNA ) we do not expect that there is any overt bias in the microarray data , but as with any statistical sampling method , greater con-ﬁdence can be assigned to cases where more probes are positive . 
Indeed , new analytical methods capable of assigning statistical conﬁdence to genetic relationships derived from microarray hybridization data will be nee-ded to address some of these questions . 
As with any hybridization-based technique , failure of targets to hybridize does not necessarily mean that a homologous sequence is not present ( Wu et al. 2001 ) . 
Depending on the stringency of the hybridization conditions , labelling efﬁciency , and length of microarray probe , we generally ﬁnd that gene sequences with > 10 % sequence divergence ( randomly distributed ) will result in a low binding efﬁciency and these targets are likely to appear negative with the microarray ( Call et al. 2003b ) . 
In the present study , hybridization signal declines rapidly as sequence similarity declined below 95 % ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Consequently , failure to detect a gene fragment does not mean that a relatively close homologue is not present and additional analyses would be needed to conﬁrm that a gene homologue is truly absent . 
This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing and applying a mixed-plasmid microarray to study the distribution of plasmid sequences among wildtype plasmids . 
The methods were robust as shown by ( i ) very similar results from replicate hybridizations of the same plasmids , ( ii ) clear differentiation of closely related serovar-speciﬁc virulence plasmids and ( iii ) independent retrieval of sequences by either PCR or microarray probes ( e.g. , blaCMY-2 ) . 
After characterizing plasmids from 42 isolates of E. coli and S. enterica it was clear that the mosaic model of plasmid composition is applicable to plasmids of enteric origin and that this diversity can be fruitfully investigated by hybridization to randomly cloned plasmid gene probes in a microarray format . 
In this study we also identiﬁed several genes that are probably linked to a horizontally transmissible transposon that harbors the blaCMY-2 gene , although additional study will be needed to conﬁrm this observation .
