Abstract 
tous phage prepared as probes physically adsorbed to piezoelectric transducers . 
Quantitative deposition studies indicated that ≈ 3 × 1010 phage particles/cm2 could be irreversibly adsorbed for 1 h at room temperature to prepare working biosensors . 
The quality of phage deposition was monitored by ﬂuorescent microscopy . 
Speciﬁc-bacterial binding resulted in resonance frequency changes of prepared sensors , which were evaluated using linear regression analysis . 
Sensors possessed a rapid response time of < 180 s , had a low-detection limit of 102 cells/ml and were linear over a range of 101 -- 107 cells/ml with a sensitivity of 10.9 Hz per order of magnitude of S. typhimurium concentration . 
Viscosity effects due to increasing bacterial concentration and non-speciﬁc binding were not signiﬁcant to the piezoelectric platform as conﬁrmed by dose -- response analysis . 
Phage -- bacterial binding was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence and scanning electron microscopy . 
Overall , phage may constitute effective bioreceptors for use with analytical platforms for detecting and monitoring bacterial agents , including use in food products and possibly biological warfare applications .

1. Introduction
gastrointestinal foodborne illness ( Preliminary foodnet data , 2003 ) and a potential weapon for bioterrorism ( Khan et al. , 2001 ) . 
The ability to rapidly identify this biological agent and other pathogens , regardless of their contamination origin , is an important consideration of any comprehensive strategic plan to maintain safety and security of the public food supply ( Progress report to Secretary Tommy G. Thompson , 2003 ) . 
Current research initiatives to replace conventional methods of food analysis that are slower , laborintensive , and cost-inefﬁcient include real-time , deployable Salmonella typhimurium remains a leading cause of threat agent detectors based on biosensors ( Alocilja and Radke , 2003 ) . 
The majority of rapid detection biosensors described in the literature for S. typhimurium have utilized antibodies as bioreceptors ( Kaspar et al. , 2000 ; Skládal , 2003 ) . 
Antibodies can be extremely narrow ( monoclonal ) or broad ( polyclonal ) in their speciﬁcity and generally have very high afﬁnities ( picomolar ) . 
In the production of quartz crystal microbalance ( QCM ) - based immunosensors , they are immobilized to the substrate via their hydrophobic Fc fraction , with the antigen binding Fab fraction being oriented outward to capture the target . 
However , while sensitive and selective , antibodies possess numerous disadvantages for use as biodetectors in food products or as diagnostic bench-top sensors . 
These disadvantages include high cost of production , low availability , high fragility , lack of reusability , and the need for laborious immobilization methods to sensor substrates ( Petrenko and Vodyanoy , 2003 ) . 
A resilient alternative to antibodies is ﬁlamentous phage afﬁnity-selected from a landscape library for speciﬁc , selective binding to a target biomolecules ( Sorokulova et al. , 2005 ) . 
The Ff class of ﬁlamentous bacteriophage can tolerate the incorporation of foreign DNA through recombinant modiﬁcation -- expressing the foreign peptides on the surface of the virion for presentation to a complementary target , such as cell receptors on the outer membrane of Salmonella . 
In this way , they can act as antibody substitutes , possessing distinct advantages over their natural counterparts including durability , reusability , stability , standardization , and low-cost production , while achieving equivalent speciﬁcity and sensitivity ( Petrenko and Smith , 2000 ) . 
The use of phage display to prepare phage as antibody substitute probes to overcome the weak points of antibodies has been discussed ( Petrenko and Vodyanoy , 2003 ) . 
Numerous phage applications have been proposed ( Smith and Petrenko , 1997 ) , including the detection of bacteria ( Petrenko and Sorokulova , 2004 ) . 
Previously , we demonstrated that afﬁnity-selected landscape phage probes for S. typhimurium possess the speciﬁcity , selectivity , and afﬁnity of monoclonal antibodies and can be utilized as probes for the detection of S. typhimurium ( Sorokulova et al. , 2005 ) . 
Phage-based electronic-based biodetectors for bacteria have not been described in the literature , although Petrenko and Vodyanoy ( 2003 ) have discussed the potential of phage in conjunction with the QCM for proof-in-concept detection of threat agents . 
In addition to previously mentioned advantages over antibodies , the outer coat protein structure of ﬁlamentous phage appears to be highly amenable to simple immobilization through physical adsorption directly to the gold surface of the QCM electrode , thus providing another engineering advantage while maintaining peak biological functionality . 
As proof-of-concept , we prepared biosensors for the rapid detection of S. typhimurium based on afﬁnityselected ﬁlamentous bacteriophage immobilized to acoustic wave transducers by physical adsorption .

2.1. Microorganisms
2.1.1. Bacteriophage
typhimurium ( clone E2 -- displaying foreign peptide VTPPTQHQ used in this work ) were derived previously from a landscape f8/8 phage library ( Petrenko et al. , 1996 ) through afﬁnity-selection procedures described by Sorokulova et al. ( 2005 ) . 
Filamentous phage as speciﬁc , selective probes for S. 
2.1.2. Bacteria
can Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) was conﬁrmed S. typhimurium ( ATCC 13311 ) obtained from the Amerifor identity , propagated , and maintained as described by Sorokulova et al. ( 2005 ) . 
2.2. Test solutions
The functional performance of biosensors was evaluated with bacterial suspensions prepared from an overnight culture of S. typhimurium in an orbital shaker -- incubator ( 37 ◦ C , ≈ 200 rpm ) . 
The overnight culture was washed ( 3 × ) by centrifugation ( 5500 rpm , 15 min , 10 ◦ C ) in 20 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , 0.15 M NaCl , 5 mM NaH2PO4 , [ pH 7.0 ] ) with ﬁnal resuspension in 2 ml PBS . 
An aliquot ( ranging from 125 to 600 l depending upon growth ) of the culture was diluted with 4 ml 0.5 % ( v/v ) Tween20 in 1 × TBS ( 50 mM Tris -- HCl , 0.15 M NaCl , pH 7.5 ) to prepare a ﬁnal suspension of OD 0.8620 . 
The suspension was serially diluted with PBS to prepare bacterial suspensions ranging from approximately 101 to 107 cells/ml . 
Bacterial cell counts were conﬁrmed through standard plate count of the three most dilute cell suspensions giving 30 -- 300 colonies . 
Plate counts were performed in triplicate , averaged , and multiplied by the dilution factor to derive CFU count per milliliter . 
All test solutions were prepared the day of biosensor testing and maintained on ice or at 4 ◦ C until use , then brought to room temperature . 
2.3. Bacteria binding measurements
quartz resonators , and binding measurement procedures used in deposition experiments and sensor evaluations have been described ( Olsen et al. , 2003 ; Pathirana et al. , 2000 ) . 
Monitors were calibrated prior to use . 
All experiments were conducted at room temperature . 
All components used in deposition experiments were contained within an AtmosbagTM isolation chamber ( Sigma -- Aldrich ) inﬂated with puriﬁed nitrogen gas to prevent airborne contamination of the resonator . 
where sensor response output in the form of frequency or voltage changes were recorded . 
Response data from experiments was analyzed using MicrocalTM Origin ® 6.0 ( Microcal Software , Northampton , MA ) . 
For mass deposition , graphs depicting frequency change as a function of time were prepared . 
The frequency difference between beginning ( prior to deposition ) and ending ( following deposition ) steady-state levels of masses was determined from these graphs . 
For biosensors , a cumulative graph of frequency or voltage changes as a function of time was plotted for all bacterial suspensions tested on that sensor . 
Visual inspection of this graph allowed estimation of steady-state sensor responses . 
Generally , steady state was achieved within several 100 s following application of the test suspension , but in order to maintain data congruency between all sensors was considered to be the last 2 min of each 7-min test suspension incubation . 
From these last 2 min , an average steady-state frequency response for each test suspension applied to a sensor was determine The Maxtek acoustic wave device ( AWD ) , accompanying The AWD was interfaced with a data-processing unit , statistically ( 120 data points ) , then plotted to derive a graph of the mean steady-state responses of the sensor as a function of the bacterial test suspension concentration . 
Linear regression was applied to the data points to determine correlation coefﬁcient , slope , and signiﬁcance . 
Biosensor results were considered statistically different when the p-value was less than 0.05 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval ) . 
2.4. Microscopic analysis of sensors
Conﬁrmation of phage immobilization and phage -- bacteria binding at the sensor surface was conducted by ﬂuorescent and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
Labeling of the phage has been previously described ( Sorokulova et al. , 2005 ) . 
S. typhimurium cells were ﬂuorescently labeled ( Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Labeling Kit , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) by adding a bacterial suspension ( 1 ml ; 107 cells/ml in PBS ) to a vial of reactive dye , then incubating 1 h at 4 ◦ C. Cells were washed ( 3 × ) with 20 ml PBS by centrifugation ( 3500 rpm , 10 min , 4 ◦ C ) prior to use . 
Fluorescence microscopy arrangement consisted of an operational QCM apparatus with installed resonator viewed under a Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) ECLIPSE E800 ﬂuorescent microscope equipped with 100 W Hg lamp , and 4 × ( NA 0.13 ) , 40 × ( Plan Fluor DIC M , NA 0.75 ) , 60 × ( Plan Apo , NA 1.40 ) and 100 × objectives ( Plan Apo , NA 1.40 ) . 
Digital images ( 500 -- 550 nm ) were captured using a SPOT RT Slider CCD video camera ( 1520 × 1080 pixels optical resolution ) ( Diagnostic Instruments , Inc. , Sterling Heights , MI ) with exposure settings : red , 1.3 s ; green , 2.02 s. Images were transferred to a data processing unit ( Dell Corp. , Round Rock , TX ) for storage and processing using SPOT Advanced software ( Ver . 
3.5.9 for Windows 2000 ; build 6 August 2003 , Diagnostic Instruments ) and Adobe ® Photoshop ® ( Ver . 
5.0 LE , Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) . 
taken in 20 s intervals for up to 2 h. Following phage adsorption for a speciﬁed duration , the resonator was removed from the sensor probe using clean forceps , rinsed of excess phage by immersion in degassed water ( 3 × ) , and examined under ﬂuorescent oil immersion ( 1000 × ) . 
A negative control , consisting of a new , clean resonator treated with Alexa 488 ﬂuorescent dye , was incorporated into the study for comparison . 
at room temperature for 24 h in a sealed petri dish by elevating them over a small layer of desiccant using wooden applicator sticks . 
A resonator incorporating only phage was prepared in the same manner as a control . 
The dried sensors were mounted onto aluminum stubs with carbon adhesive tape then sputter-coated at 0.02 mbar Ar gas pressure with a 60:40 Au/Pd mixture at 30 mA for 1.5 min . 
Sensors were examined using a Zeiss DSM 940 SEM ( Thornwood , NY ) at 10 kV . 
Micrographs of the specimens were captured digitally using a Digital Image Transfer Recognition Program ( Zeiss ) , and processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE . 
Sequential photos of phage adsorption to resonators were For SEM , previously assayed biosensors were air-dried 
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phage deposition to resonators by physical adsorption
An initial phage deposition study based on the `` dip and dry '' gravimetric procedure of Prusak-Sochaczewski and Luong ( 1990 ) was conducted to determine the feasibility of physically adsorbing ﬁlamentous phage to resonators and if successful , the optimal conditions of time and concentration necessary for the preparation of biosensors capable of detecting S. typhimurium under liquid conditions . 
Dip and dry refers to measurement of the change in the resonant frequency , f , of a dry resonator prior to and after deposition of mass . 
According to theory ( Sauerbrey , 1959 ) , a mass ( attributed here to the mass of phage ) , m , deposited to the active area of the sensing electrode results in a decrease of the resonator 's oscillation frequency , the total value of which can be solved for using Sauerbrey ( 1959 ) equation as follows , assuming that the mass creates a rigid , uniform ﬁlm that does not slip and has the same acousto -- elastic properties as quartz : where f is the observed change in frequency ( Hz ) of the resonator under oscillation at its fundamental frequency due to mass loading , Cf the sensitivity factor of the resonator in Hz / ( ng cm − 2 ) , and m is the change in mass per unit area in g/cm2 . 
The sensitivity factor ( Cf ) of Maxtek 's 5 MHz AT-cut resonator is 0.0566 Hz / ( ng cm − 2 ) at 20 ◦ C , and takes into account the harmonic number at which the resonator is driven , resonant frequency ( Hz ) of the fundamental mode of the resonator , and the density and effective piezoelectrically stiffened shear modulus of the quartz substrate ( RQCM Operation and Service Manual , 2003 ) . 
sensor , much like a very sensitive nanobalance . 
A representative graph demonstrating phage adsorption as a function of time is shown in Fig. 1A . 
The graph depicts the steady-state oscillation of a dry , clean resonator at resonance prior to the application of 1 ml of diluted stock phage E2 in suspension ( 6.7 × 1010 virions/ml ) ( fS ) , followed by an 18 h incubation period at room temperature , removal ( fR ) of the phage suspension and washing with degassed water , and ﬁnally drying , with a subsequent return to steady-state resonance ( fE ) . 
The resulting frequency change , f , measured as a decrease , fS − fE , was − 161 ± 0.5 Hz , indicating that phage adsorbed to the resonator . 
This is contrasted by a control ( Fig. 1B ) consisting of a clean resonator interrogated with degassed water only , which resulted in no frequency change ( fS − fE = 0 ± 0.5 Hz ) . 
were determined for periods up to 24 h ( 1440 min ) ( Table 1 ) . 
When the quantity of adhered phage is graphed as a function of time ( Fig. 2 ) and a sigmoidal curve is ﬁtted to the experimental data points , a strong relationship is eviden Using this approach , the resonator acts as a gravimetric Resonance frequency changes due to phage adsorption

Extrapolation of the curve at the 120 min time point yields f of approximately -- 150 Hz . 
This represents a 92 % total frequency change in relation to the maximum frequency change observed at 24 h ( − 163 Hz ) , indicating that the majority of phage appears to adsorb within the ﬁrst few hours after deposition is commenced . 
The quantity of phage , in virions , can be calculated from the total adsorbed biomass , m , if the mass of a single recombinant fd-tet phage is estimated at 2.66 × 107 Da , based on 4000 pVIII outer coat proteins each containing 55 amino acids with a total molecular weight 2.35 × 107 , and DNA with a molecular weight of 3.04 × 106 . 
As shown in Table 1 , the total number of phage particles deposited to the active area of the sensing electrode ranged from 1.8 × 1010 to 6.5 × 1010 virions as a function of the substrate 's exposure time ( 20 min -- 24 h , respectively ) to phage in suspension .

Phage adsorption to the sensing electrode of the resonator was conﬁrmed in real-time by ﬂuorescence microscopy for periods up to two consecutive hours ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Visual observations indicate that phage deposition may be affected by several factors in addition to the attractive force between the phage and gold ( electrode of the resonator ) , including sedimentation , refractory movements of the phage in suspension due to resonator perturbations , and the tendency of phage to aggregate in solution , resulting in decreased quantity and quality of deposition when large bundles deposit outside that portion of the sensing electrode where piezoelectricity , and thus frequency changes associated with the resonator , is active . 
This statement is consistent with large standard deviations in 20 , 40 , and 60 min deposition experiments ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Quantitative deposition data together with visual observations suggests that lateral phage aggregates or `` bundles , '' rather than individual particles , might be the prevalent state of deposition to the electrode if one considers the size of individual phage particles and the area of the electrode available for deposition . 
If the dimensions of a single recombinant fd-tet virion are estimated at 10 nm ( diameter ) × 1300 nm ( length ) , then the approximate electrode surface area that would be occupied in a space-ﬁlling model by a single , laterally adsorbed phage particle would be 13,000 nm2 or 1.3 × 10 − 14 m2 . 
The active area of the sensing electrode is equal to 34.19 mm2 or 34 × 10 − 6 m2 of the upper sensing electrode ( RQCM Operation and Service Manual , 2003 ) . 
Given these dimensions , the estimated total number of adsorbed phage particles that could occupy the active sensing electrode surface area , if laterally aligned one layer thick , is 34 × 10 − 6 m2/1 .3 × 10 − 14 m2 = 2.6 × 109 virions . 
Experimental data ( Table 1 ) shows that the amount of phage deposited within only 20 min exceeds this quantity ﬁve-fold . 
This would seem to indicate that either ﬁve or more unidirectional aligned layers of individual particles , or more likely large bundles of phage particles that bind to each other as aggregates in solution , are deposited . 
An alternative explanation is that phage is adsorbed on-end , that is , the particle attaches by its tip hydrophobically through charge differences or via cysteine residues in minor coat proteins , forming Au -- sulﬁde bonds . 
According to the space-ﬁlling model of Yaglom ( 1972 ) , packaging occurs most economically when discs are arranged as a hexagonal lattice . 
Therefore , if cylindrical phage particles are attached by the tip then the density of virions will be much larger compared to the oblique orientation . 
In this case , the density of ﬁlling ( f ) is

Overman et al. , ( 2004 ) have demonstrated salt - and concentration-dependent associative properties of phage aggregates , resulting in different physical alignments ( unilateral or non-unidirectional ) based on molar concentration of salt and virion concentration in solution . 
Thus , further experimentation with salt-virion proportions and concentrations may reveal different physical adsorption properties . 
Deposition of phage to the sensing electrode was characterized by strong , non-reversible binding under aqueous conditions , as washing with numerous changes of water ( Fig. 4A ) or extended immersion in water ( Fig. 4B ) under operational conditions for durations up to 55 h resulted in no measurable loss of adsorbed phage from the surface of the resonator . 
While the exact nature and strength of the attractive force between phage and resonator was not determined , possible explanations for protein physical adsorption to gold include hydrophobic bonding , weak H + bonding , and van der Waal forces , along with covalent bonding through Cys -- SH groups mentioned above .

3.2. Biosensor preparation and testing
Based on phage deposition studies with concurrent visual observations , a period of 1 h was selected for the preparation of biosensors by physical adsorption . 
For each sensor prepared , 1 ml of diluted phage ( 6.7 × 1010 virions/ml with PBS ) was incubated on the resonator for 1 h at room temperature , ensuring total immersion of the sensing electrode . 
Following this period , the phage solution was gently removed then the resonator was washed ( 3 × ) by immersion in 25 ml PBS with gentle rocking and blocked with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( 1 g/ml for 1 h at 4 ◦ C ) . 
The resonator was again washed ( 3 × ) with PBS then tested with a logarithmic series of S. typhimurium test suspension as previously described ( Olsen et al. , 2003 ; Pathirana et al. , 2000 ) . 
Fig. 5A depicts typical frequency changes resulting from bacterial binding as a function of increasing logarithmic concentrations of free bacteria in suspension . 
These changes are hypothetically due to both mass changes associated with binding bacteria and viscoelastic changes resulting from phage -- bacteria interaction at the solid/liquid interface ( Pathirana et al. , 2000 ) . 
For each concentration , the sensor quickly comes to steady-state equilibrium within several 100 s following speciﬁc phage -- bacteria binding . 
When the mean values of steady-state frequency readings are plotted as a function of bacterial concentration ( Fig. 5B ) , and a linear line ﬁt , a high dose -- response relationship is evident ( R = − 0.98 , p < 0.001 ) with the biosensor being linear over six decades of bacterial concentration . 
The sensitivity of the biosensor ( − 10.9 Hz ) , measured as the slope of the linear portion of the dose -- response was vastly greater than the established background ( < ± 1 Hz , data not shown ) . 
The lower limit of detection based on the dose -- response curve was estimated at 100 cells/ml , well below the infectious dosage reported for Salmonella-induced gastroenteritis . 
These results are very comparable with our previous observations for Salmonella biosensors prepared with polyclonal antibodies ( Olsen et al. , 2003 ; Pathirana et al. , 2000 ) . 
Viscosity effects on the piezoelectric platform due to increasing bacterial concentration and non-speciﬁc binding are insignificant as conﬁrmed by dose -- response curves ( Fig. 5C and D ) from a clean , unmodiﬁed sensor . 
Visual observation by ﬂuo-rescent and scanning electron microscopy ( Fig. 6 ) conﬁrmed attachment of bacteria to the surface of the resonator coated with ﬁlamentous phage . 
While these results typify the majority of sensor dose -- responses , not all prepared sensors functioned in this manner . 
Some sensors had ﬂat dose -- responses , exhibiting only an initial negative frequency change when challenged with the lowest concentrations of bacteria in comparison to the control solution , PBS . 
This may suggest that saturation of the bioreceptor by the bacteria occurred early in the testing process . 
Possibly , only a small amount of phage was actively adsorbed onto the sensor electrode and/or possessed unfavorable spatial orientation as a result of the somewhat uncontrolled phage adsorption process , resulting in a small number of ﬁrm binding sites for the bacterial receptor . 
As well , a minority of sensors demonstrated distinct inverse correlation as previously noted with environmentally aged antibody sensors for S. typhimurium , and sensors prepared for E. coli using H-antigen antibodies ( Olsen et al. , 2003 ) . 
Again , we hypothesize that the nature of the deposition process results in less than optimal spatial orderliness of phage on the sensor . 
This in turn results in loose binding of the analyte at the solid/liquid interface . 
We are currently researching the effects that tethered macromolecules have on resonator frequency and anticipate releasing these results in the near future to show loose binding as a mass -- spring system based on the research of Dybwad ( 1985 ) and others . 
We also hope to identify the speciﬁc-bacterial receptor targeted by the phage , which would provide great insight into loose binding if the receptor is an outer membrane associated structure such as ﬂagella or ﬁmbriae ( Sorokulova et al. , 2005 ) .

Furthermore , the nature of the bioreceptor layer holds potential utilization for development against any bacteria , virus or toxin to which a corresponding phage could be afﬁnity-selected for .
