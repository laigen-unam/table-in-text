Abstract 
Under non-lethal selective conditions , a non-dividing or very slowly dividing microbial population gives rise to mutations that relieve selective pressures . 
This process is described as adaptive mutation . 
Salmonella typhimurium strain 5-28 has been used as a system for studying adaptive mutations in the chromosomal regulatory gene purR and its target , the purD operator . 
When this strain is plated on a minimal lactose medium , no apparent growth of parent lawn is observed , yet the revertant colonies accumulate over a period of time . 
Analysis of the purR mutational spectra showed that the frequencies of transitions and transversions were not signiﬁcantly different among the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations . 
But the frequencies for ﬁve kinds of − 1 frameshifts were signiﬁcantly different between the growth-dependent and adaptive types . 
Among the growth-dependent mutations , most one-base deletions occurred in non-iterated bases and were distributed randomly . 
Among adaptive mutations , the frequency of one-base deletions in small mononucleotide repeats was higher and mutations were concentrated at three hotspots . 
One-base deletion in small mononucleotide repeats are generally believed to result from DNA polymerase slippage errors , which are not corrected by DNA repair machinery . 
We further investigated the role of DNA repair on adaptive mutation . 
Our results showed that the mismatch repair ( MMR ) might function less efﬁciently during adaptive mutation . 
However , DNA oxidative damage repair seemed no less effective in correcting errors under selective pressures than during non-selective growth .

1. Introduction
` directed mutation ' , implying that only advantageous mutations occurred under non-lethal selection . 
Subsequent studies showed that non-selective mutations could also arise during selection [ 1,2 ] . 
Therefore , adaptive ( or stationary-phase ) mutation was re-deﬁned as a process Adaptive mutation was originally described as that produces mutations that relieve the selective pressure , whether or not other non-selected mutations are also produced [ 3 ] . 
Since microoganisms naturally exist under conditions of limited nutrients or in other adverse environment , most of the cells are growing less actively or in a static state . 
Therefore , the potential importance of adaptive mutability is great . 
Elucidating the mechanisms of adaptive mutation will help decipher the process of microbial evolution , and might shed light on understanding oncogenesis , aging , immune responses , and drug resistance [ 4,5 ] . 
Many models and hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of adaptive mutation [ 5 -- 8 ] .

Analyses of mutational spectra indicated that adaptive mutagenesis may be a different process from the growth-dependent mutagenesis . 
Studies from the well-known E. coli lac frameshift system ( FC40 ) showed that adaptive Lac + reversions were nearly all − 1 deletions in mononucleotide repeats , whereas growth-dependent Lac + reversions were heterogeneous [ 9,10 ] . 
It should be noted that this reversion system is to some extent unsatisfactory for determining mutational spectra because , for any given mutation , there are limited numbers of sites and kinds of mutations that will produce a revertant phenotype . 
Moreover , adaptive mutation in FC40 may be a special case because the reporter allele is located on the F ′ - episome . 
In order to reveal the general mechanisms of adaptive mutation , it is important to compare the mutational spectra of the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations in chromosomal genes and to select for forward mutations than for reversions . 
In early 1990s , Ninio suggested that stationary phase mutations were due to a decline in the mismatch repair function ( MMR ) [ 11 ] . 
In E. coli , the products of mutL , mutS , mutH and uvrD genes are essential for mismatch repairing activity . 
Studies from two research groups disagreed on the effects of MMR on adaptive mutations in E. coli FC40 system [ 12 -- 14 ] . 
Another DNA repair system associated with adaptive mutations was suggested to be DNA oxidative damage repair , in which mutY , mutM ( fpg-1 ) and mutT gene products were involved [ 15 ] . 
Bridges reported that oxidative damage repair appeared to involve in producing the stationary-phase reversions of amino acid auxotrophy [ 16 -- 18 ] . 
However , in E. coli strain FC40 , the deﬁciency of oxidative damage repair had no effect on adaptive mutation [ 19 ] . 
Thus the role of DNA repair in adaptive mutation is still waiting to be answered . 
In this report , we try to address the above issues by using S. typhimurium strain 5-28 , a strain with a phenotype of the purR super-repression [ 20 ] . 
Salmonellae are naturally Lac − . 
Therefore , E. coli lac genes , as a part of the MudJ element , were inserted in the purD gene , where lac genes are subject to the purR regulation . 
The purR super-repressor represses expression of lac genes and prevents the strain from utilizing lactose . 
However , under the lactose selection , this strain undergoes spontaneous mutations in purR gene and the purD operator , permitting it to utilize lactose . 
In our previous study [ 20 ] , we reported that among the growth-dependent mutations , 68 % of the Lac + mutations affected the purR gene and 32 % affected the purD operator . 
Whereas , among the adaptive mutations , the frequency of mutation in the purR gene was signiﬁcantly increased to 95 % , and decreased to 5 % in the purD operator . 
In this study , we ﬁrst compared the mutational spectra in purR gene between the growth-dependent and adaptive mutants . 
Second , we investigated whether DNA repair machinery play a role in the occurrence of adaptive mutations .

2.5. Construction of strains with defective oxidative damage repair
S. typhimurium galE − strain is sensitive to E. coli phage P1 . 
We ﬁrst introduced E. coli repair defective genes mutT : : KanR , mutY : : KanR and fpg-1 : : KanR into the S. typhimurium galE − strain LB5010 , respectively , by P1 transduction [ 22 ] . 
Then each gene was introduced separately into 5-282 by the conventional P22 transduction [ 23 ] . 
2.6. Veriﬁcation of repair defective strains
The mutator phenotype of the repair defective strains was veriﬁed by a high spontaneous reversion to rifampicin resistance [ 24 ] . 
From a starting inoculum of no more than 100 cells , ﬁve to eight independent cultures of each strain , 5-282mutT , 5-282mutY and 5-282fpg-1 , were grown to saturation in LB medium at 30 ◦ C. Numbers of viable cells were determined on LB plates . 
An aliquot of 0.1 ml cultures was spread onto rifampicin LB plates and incubated at 30 ◦ C. RifR mutants were counted after 2 days of incubation . 
Mutation rate was averaged as a mean of ﬁve to eight independent cultures . 
2.7. Accumulation of Lac+ mutants on lactose selective medium
The protocol for isolating Lac + mutants was described in Yang et al. [ 20 ] . 
Five to eight independent cultures of strain 5-28 or its repair deﬁcient derivatives were grown to saturation in LB medium and stored at 4 ◦ C for 2 days . 
The frequency of Lac + mutants was determined at the same time on minimal lactose plates . 
The culture with the lowest number of Lac + mutants was used to inoculate 30 -- 40 of 2-ml LB broth . 
The starting inoculum was about 106 cells per ml . 
When grown to saturation , these cultures reached a density of 3 × 109 cells per ml . 
Cells were then harvested , washed twice , and resuspended in 1 ml NaCl saline . 
Total of 108 cells of 5-282 , 5-282mutY , 5-282fpg-1 and 107 cells of 5-282MMR − and 5-282mutT wer plated respectively , along with 109 scavenger cells ( LT2 ) , on the minimal lactose plates . 
The Lac + colonies were scored after 2 days of incubation at 30 ◦ C and continuously counted on each day until the 5th day . 
Numbers of viable cells on the minimal lactose plates were determined as described in Yang et al. [ 20 ] .

2.8. Reconstruction experiments
Reconstruction experiments were performed according to the protocol described by Prival and Cebula [ 25 ] and Harris et al. [ 14 ] . 
2.9. Rate determination of growth-dependent and adaptive mutation
The Lac + colonies appeared 2 days after plated on the minimal lactose medium were characterized as the growth-dependent mutants . 
Growth-dependent mutation rate was + determined by the Lac mutations occurred per cell per generation and calculated using the P method [ 26 ] or the method 0 of median [ 27,28 ] . 
Adaptive mutation rate was calculated as a mean number of Lac + mutations per cell per day and counted from the numbers of the Lac + colonies appeared on days 3 -- 5 after plated on the minimal lactose medium . 
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of growth-dependent and adaptive mutational spectra in purR gene
Total 41 growth-dependent and 50 adaptive purR mutants were analyzed by DNA sequencing . 
Mutational spectra in purR gene are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 2 . 
A signiﬁcant number of mutations isolated from either the growth-dependent and adaptive mutants were distributed in the coding region of purR gene , including transitions , transversions , deletions , insertions and duplications . 
All of these mutations converted purR + to purR − . 
Interestingly , one mutation , isolated from the growth-dependent mutants , was found located in the TAAT box . 
The purine repressor , PurR , is a 341-amino acid protein . 
It consists of two functional domains , an NH2-terminal DNA binding domain ( DBD , amino acid 1 -- 60 ) , and a COOH-terminal corepressor-binding domain ( CBD , amino acid 61 -- 341 ) . 
We observed two categories of large fragment deletions . 
The ﬁrst category of large fragment deletions includes the growth-dependent mutation R2 and adaptive mutations A1 -- A4 ( Table 2 ) . 
These ﬁve deletions appeared to cover both 5 ′ non-coding region and the ﬁrst part of the DBD . 
The second category such as the R3 mutant seemed to generate deletion in the DBD only . 
Furthermore , we conﬁrmed that some amino acids are essential for the PurR function [ 29,30 ] . 
For example , mutations at Thr16 , His20 , Arg26 , Tyr45 or Ser48 cause the PurR repressor defective in DNA binding . 
Tyr282 mutation leads to the loss of binding activity to both DNA and its corepressor . 
G721A mutation disrupts the PurR repressor binding to the corepressor . 
C618T mutation seems to perturb the interdomain signaling and subsequently reduces its DNA binding afﬁnity . 
Other amino acid substitutions have been shown to affect the PurR activity greatly although the molecular mechanisms of these mutations on the PurR function still remain largely unknown . 
Further studies on these mutants may provide insights to the structure and function of the PurR transcriptional factor . 
Because it was difﬁcult to ﬁnd a proper method to compare the overall spectra , we did a series of tests ( by contingency χ2 ) to detect the subtle difference between the growth-dependent and the adaptive spectra ( Table 3 ) . 
First , we compared the distributions of transitions and transversions in the growth-dependent and adaptive spectra , the result showed that neither transitions nor transversions differed signiﬁcantly between the two spectra ( two-tail : P = 0.55 ) . 
Second , we compared the distributions of substitutions and one-base frameshifts between the two spectra . 
Again , we found no signiﬁcant difference between the two spectra . 
Third , we used the extension of Fisher 's Exact Test to compare the frequencies for ﬁve kinds of one-base deletion in 2A run , 4T run , 5A run , 7A run and non-iterated bases . 
The result showed that the difference between the two mutational spectra was statistically signiﬁcant with a P value of 0.047 . 
Among the growth-dependent mutations , most of the one-base deletions occurred in non-iterated bases and distributed randomly . 
However , among the adaptive mutations , the frequency of one-base deletion in small mononucleotide repeats was signiﬁcantly higher . 
Three hotspots for one-base deletions were identiﬁed at 7A run ( 526 -- 532 bp ) , 2A run ( 567 -- 568 bp ) , and 5A run ( 586 -- 590 bp ) . 
Finally , we compared the distributions of the fragment deletions between the two spectra . 
We found that the frequency of fragment deletions among the adaptive mutations was increased about two-fold relative to that of the growth-dependent mutations . 
3.2. Effect of overexpression of methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins on the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations
Methyl-directed mismatch repair plays an important role in purging mutations and maintaining genom stability [ 31 ] . 
In order to investigate the potential role of MMR in adaptive mutation , we introduced MMR expression plasmids into strain 5-282 to examine whether adaptive mutations could be reduced by over-expressing MMR proteins . 
The MMR expression plasmids in this study were ﬁrst introduced by Harris et al. [ 13 ] . 
In order to determine whether cells carrying MMR plasmids take longer than 2 days to form colonies , we estimated the time required for the Lac + colony formation in parallel with each mutation assay . 
Our result showed that the vast majority of the Lac + mutants formed visible colonies at 48 h. Therefore , we scored the growth-dependent mutants at 48 h , and the adaptive mutants at day 3 -- 5 . 
Table 4 showed that the overexpression of MutL and/or MutS reduced the adaptive mutations by about 50 -- 60 % . 
Whereas , the overexpression of MutL or

The growth-dependent mutations are abbreviated by R and the adaptive mutations by A . 
The mutations are numbered from R1 to R41 and A1 to A50 . 
Each mutation is listed according to its position in purR gene . 
The bold-faced amino acids and nucleotides are those whose functions have been reported 
MutS reduced the growth-dependent mutations only by about 15 % and 40 % , respectively . 
This observation supported our speculation that adaptive mutation is associated with declined MMR activity in stationary-phase cells . 
Thus , the overexpression of MMR genes has a more profound effect on the formation of the adaptive mutations . 
3.3. Effect of DNA oxidative damage repair deﬁciency on the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations
DNA oxidative damage repair is an important shortpatch repair system existed in bacteria . 
This repair machinery eliminates G : C → T : A transversion , which is resulted from the 8-oxoG mispairing with A. Strains bearing fpg-1 , mutY or mutT mutation have a mutato

The non-coding regions of the purR gene are depicted by straight lines . 
The coding region of the purR gene is represented by open and ﬁlled boxes . 
The open box represents the DNA binding domain ( DBD ) and the ﬁlled box represents the co-repressor binding domain ( CBD ) .

The 5 ′ non-coding region ranges from 1 to 281 bp . 
A growth-dependent mutation T120G occurred in the TAAT box TCAGACAAAAT ( 115 -- 120 bp ) . 
The purR coding region starts at 282 bp and ends at 1307 bp . 
Mutations isolated from either the growth-dependent or the adaptive mutations are shown on the schematic purR coding region . 
Spectral comparison of the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations in the purR gene phenotype [ 31 ] . 
We observed in our study that a defect in the mutT gene increased the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations by about 40 - and 30-fold , respectively . 
Defect in the mutY gene increased the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations by about 3 - and 2-fold , respectively . 
Defect in the mutM/fpg -1 gene had no effect on the growth-dependent mutations and only slightly increased the adaptive mutations ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This result indicated that oxidative damage repair had a similar effect on either the growth-dependent or the adaptive mutations , implying that it maintains sufﬁcient repairing activity under a selective condition . 
Nevertheless , we could not exclude the possibility that the 8-oxoG , when not repaired , causes a fraction of adaptive mutations .

3.4. Effect of overexpression of oxidative damage repair proteins on the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations
As shown in Table 5 , overexpression of Fpg-1 , MutY or MutT proteins reduced the growth-dependent mutations by about 20 % . 
Similarly , overexpression of MutY or MutT reduced the adaptive mutations by about 30 % . 
However , overexpression of Fpg-1 ( MutM ) had a stronger effect , reducing the adaptive mutations by about 50 % . 
We explained the effect of the fpg-1 gene on the adaptive mutations as following . 
It has been reported that Fapy glycosylase encoded by fpg-1 gene maintains a low protein level throughout most of the growth cycle except in the early logarithmic phase [ 16 ] . 
Therefore , the fpg-1 defect has little effect on spontaneous mutations . 
Under a stressful nutritional condition , Fapy glycosylase produced from a multi-copy plasmid could reach a high level in resting cells , thus reduce the adaptive mutations . 
Based on the observation we had , we concluded that oxidative damage repair did not decline in the formation of adaptive mutations in our test system . 
4. Discussion
In this report , we compared the mutational spectra in purR gene between the growth-dependent and adaptive mutants . 
The most striking difference between these two spectra is that the proportion of one-base deletions within mononucleotide repeats is higher among the adaptive mutants ( 13/50 ) than among unselected mutants ( 5/41 ) . 
Moreover , most adaptive one-base deletions are localized at three hotspots , whereas most non-selective one-base deletions distributed randomly . 
In E. coli lac frameshift system FC40 and S. cerevisiae lys2 frameshift system , − 1 framshifts have been reported predominantly [ 9,10,32 ] . 
However , it should be pointed out that in these two systems , the target genes carry +1 and +4 frameshift mutations , respectively . 
Therefore , it is not surprised that the reversions mainly are − 1 framshifts events . 
In our study , we investigated the forward mutations of the purR + to the purR − . 
Interestingly , we also observed signiﬁcantly higher frequency of one-base deletions in mononucleotide repeats . 
One-base deletions in small mononucleotide repeats are generally believed to result from DNA polymerase slippage errors , which are not corrected by the mismatch repair machinery [ 33 ] . 
Based on studies from these three systems , we concluded that the selected genes seemed inclined t generate one-base deletions in mononucleotide repeats , implying the involvement of an error-prone polymerase and the down-regulation of the mismatch repair function . 
We further used strain 5-28 to investigate the potential role of DNA repair in generating adaptive mutations . 
MMR is highly conserved during evolution and plays key roles in maintaining genomic stability . 
Cells that lack MMR have 100 -- 1000 fold of increase in spontaneous mutability . 
In the cases of mice and men , MMR deﬁciency causes predisposition to tumor development [ 34 ] . 
Is adaptive mutation due to declined MMR activity ? 
Based on the studies of E. coli FC40 , two groups presented inconsistent results . 
One study suggested that the MutL was the limiting factor during adaptive mutation [ 13,14 ] . 
Another study showed that overexpression of the MutL or MutS reduced both the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations [ 12 ] . 
Studies in our system showed that overexpression of the MutL or MutS reduced the growth-dependent mutation by 15 % and 40 % , respectively . 
However , the overexpression of the MutL or MutS reduced adaptive mutations by 50 % or more . 
In addition , our previous studies showed that the mutL or mutS defect increased both the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations , but had a weaker effect on the adaptive mutations [ 20 ] . 
Therefore , we concluded that the reduced MMR function is essential to the formation of adaptive mutations . 
However , the MutL seemed not to be the limiting factor for adaptive mutations in strain 5-28 because overexpression of the MutL inhibited both the growth-dependent and the adaptive mutations although it is more prominent in adaptive mutation , and over-expression MutS also inhibits adaptive mutations . 
a small effect on a chromosomal lac region . 
Because MMR is known to correct mismatches generated during replication and growth , the authors suggested that cells with a chromosomal lac region were difﬁcult to ampliﬁed and thus grow little under the lactose selection , explaining why MutS defect had a small effect . 
In strain 5-28 , we investigated effects of either the MutL or the MutS on the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations . 
Our results showed that MMR defect in either the MutL or the MutS enhanced both the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations in the chromosomal purR gene , indicating DNA replication errors as one of the possible sources for adaptive mutations . 
However , it is still unclear what initiates DNA synthesis in non-dividing or very slowly dividing cells . 
In E. coli FC40 , it was suggested that adaptive mutations might originate from DNA replication , which was initiated by recombination intermediates . 
In the case of strain 5-28 , our primary results showed that recA null Slechta et al. [ 35 ] reported that the MutS defect had mutation only had a small effect on adaptive mutations ( unpublished results ) . 
Therefore , we suggest that adaptive mutations in a chromosomal target gene might not be mediated by a recombination function . 
Since DNA replication is minimal under stressful conditions , Bridges [ 15 ] predicted that DNA lesions play an essential important role in generating adaptive mutations . 
The most common forms of DNA lesions include alkylation and oxidative damages , with former producing the O6-methylguanine and the O4-methylthymine and latter producing the 8-oxoG . 
Both forms of damages create substitution mutations . 
Bridges et al. also investigated the role of DNA oxidative damage repair on adaptive reversions of amino acid auxotrophies and found that adaptive mutations were slightly elevated in the mutM bacteria , appreciably elevated in the mutY bacteria , and greatly elevated in the mutYmutM double mutants . 
Furthermore , overexpression of the MutY or the MutM reduced adaptive mutations by about 50 % . 
Based on these data , it was suggested that the 8-oxoG might participate in generating adaptive mutations [ 16 -- 18 ] . 
In E. coli FC40 , oxidative species might be involved in formation of adaptive mutations , but not in the form of the 8-oxoG [ 19 ] . 
In these two assays , effects of oxidative damage repair were not compared between the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations . 
Our studies showed that oxidative damage repair system seemed to have the same effect on the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations . 
Therefore , we concluded that DNA oxidative damage repair maintained an adequate repair activity under the lactose selection , comparable to that under the normal growth condition . 
In conclusion , our investigation of the purR spectra and the role of DNA repair machinery indicated that the error-prone polymerase and the down-regulation of the mismatch repair function may involved in the process of adaptive mutation . 
Our future work will focus on investigating the effect of the dinB deﬁciency on adaptive mutations and determining whether the genome could be generally mutagenized under the selection . 
We are currently undergoing investigation on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the PurRmediated super-repression of strain 5-28 . 
The initial consideration of using this strain for our adaptive mutation studies was based upon the observations that it presented a super-repression phenotype of the purR gene and furthermore , it can not utilize lactose . 
Subsequent sequence analyses showed that although this strain bears purR super-repression phenotype but no sequence change had been detected in the purR coding region . 
This result agreed with others ' observations ( personal communication ) . 
Till now , it remains an interesting question on th mechanism of the PurR-mediated super-repression . 
Nevertheless , our investigation proved that this strain can be used as a reliable system for studying adaptive mutations in a chromosomal gene .
