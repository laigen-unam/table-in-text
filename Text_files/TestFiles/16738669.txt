The mouse response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection is partly controlled through detection of the bacterium lipopolysaccharide by the host pattern recognition receptor , Toll-like receptor 4 ( Tlr4 ) . 
Mice deficient in Tlr4 signaling are extremely susceptible to Salmonella infection with a 1000-fold reduction in LD50 . 
In a previous study , we showed , using transgenic mice carrying one , three , six and 430 copies of Tlr4 , that the level of expression of this gene influences the outcome of Salmonella infection , with a plateau effect starting at three copies . 
In the present study , we further investigate the impact of Tlr4 during Salmonella infection in mice expressing Tlr4 at slightly sub-normal , normal and slightly supra-normal levels by comparing host responses in mice carrying one , two and three copies of Tlr4 on the same genetic background . 
We describe in detail the in vivo host response to pathogenic Salmonella and show for the first time , in this narrow range of Tlr4 expression , an incremental protective effect against Salmonella due to improved control of bacterial growth in target organs and increased expression of important immune response genes in the spleen .

Introduction
Recognition of pathogen invasion in vertebrates occurs initially through binding of conserved microbial motifs , the pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , with specialized host receptors , the pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .1 This system of microbial recognition is highly conserved throughout evolution and is found in plants , insects and vertebrates . 
Binding of PAMPs to signaling PRRs initiates a cascade of events that lead to the expression of a wide range of genes important in the host innate immune response and in the development of its adaptive counterpart . 
Among the prime initiators of the innate immune system , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) covering the outer wall of Gram-negative bacteria is one of the most studied and most potent immune stimulator . 
Throughout evolution , mammalians have learned to recognize LPS as the very worse of the bad news as colorfully described by Lewis in 1972:2 ` When we sense lipopolysaccharide , we are likely to turn on every

It is true , in fact , that injection of small amounts of LPS to responsive host will recapitulate the whole range of events seen with invading pathogens , leading eventually to fatal septic shock .3 Beginning with the study of Drosophila Toll ,4 the discovery of the human homologue Toll-like receptor 4 ( Tlr4 ) 5 and the cloning of the Lps gene ,6,7 our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to LPS has progressed tremendously . 
Circulating LPS are captured by the lipoprotein binding protein , which transfers them to the host LPS receptor complex believed to comprise CD14 , MD-2 and Tlr4 . 
Through its cytoplasmic Toll-Interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor ( TIR ) domain , Tlr4 transduces the LPS signal leading to the recruitment of various adaptors and kinases , resulting in the transcription of a wide array of inflammatory response genes . 
Four adaptor molecules are now recognized as important in full activation of Tlr4 signaling : the myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88 ) , the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein ( TIRAP ) , the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-b ( TRIF ) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule ( TRAM ) ( reviewed by Akira and Takeda8 ) . 
With the help of these four adaptor molecules , the Tlr4 signaling cascade follows two distinct pathways . 
On the one hand , the MyD88-dependant signaling pathway , dependant on MyD88 and TIRAP leads to rapid activation of nuclear factor-kB ( NF-kB ) and transcription of inflammatory cytokines . 
On the other hand , the TRIF/TRAM-dependant , MyD88-independent pathway leads to delayed activation of NF-kB , specific activation of IRF3 and expression of interferon ( IFN ) - b and IFN responsive genes . 
In the mouse , the host response to the Gram-negative , facultative intracellular bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( or Salmonella Typhimurium ) is strongly dependent on activation of Tlr4 by LPS . 
Indeed , mice carrying a proline for histidine substitution at codon 712 of Tlr4 are not only hyporesponsive to the effects of LPS but also extremely susceptible to Salmonella Typhimurium infection with a 1000-fold reduction of the LD .9,10 50 Moreover , the gene expression profiles of macrophages infected with Salmonella Typhimurium or exposed to LPS overlap widely .11 Finally , it has been shown that LPS is the main PAMP mediating Salmonella-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-a and nitric oxide by infected macrophages .12 Knowing the importance of Tlr4 in the mouse model of Salmonella infection , we are interested in investigating how changes in the level of expression of Tlr4 impact on the mouse response to this pathogen . 
To address this question , we previously generated four lines of Tlr4 transgenic mice carrying various copy numbers of this gene on a C57BL10/ScNCr ( B10/ScNCr ) Tlr4 null background .13 We refer to these mice as Tg382 ( one copy of Tlr4 ) , Tg388 ( three copies ) , Tg390 ( six copies ) and Tg394 ( 430 copies ) . 
Using these transgenic mice , we showed that Tlr4 copy number correlates strongly with mRNA and cell surface protein expression . 
Additionally , we identified a functional correlation with in vitro splenocytes proliferative response to LPS and in vivo susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock . 
Finally , we demonstrated that , in the presence of a wild-type allele at Nramp1 ( Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 , a gene known to be extremely important in mouse resistance to Salmonella14 ) , increasing the number of copies of Tlr4 imparts a survival advantage during Salmonella infection in mice with a plateau effect starting at three copies of the gene . 
In the present study , we further investigated the impact of Tlr4 during Salmonella infection in mice expressing Tlr4 at slightly sub-normal , normal and slightly supra-normal levels by comparing host res-ponses of mice carrying one , two and three copies of Tlr4 on the same genetic background . 
We describe in detail the host response to pathogenic Salmonella in vivo and show for the first time , in this narrow range of Tlr4 expression , an incremental protective effect against Salmonella due to improved control of bacterial growth in target organs and increased expression of important immune response genes in the spleen .

The results shown are combined from two separate infections . 
Ten to twenty mice ( both male and female ) per group were used in both experiments . 
Kaplan -- Meir survival analysis was performed on the data from the individual infections data sets and showed a significant difference in survival ( Po0 .05 ) between the F1Tg382 and the B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 compared to the F1Tg388 . 
The B10.C3HNramp1 , B10/SnJ and B10/ScNCr were increasingly susceptible to infection .

Results
We have previously shown , using transgenic mice possessing one , three , six and 430 copies of Tlr4 , that increased Tlr4 expression imparts a survival advantage during infection with Salmonella Typhimurium .13 This protective effect appears , however , to plateau starting at three copies of the gene . 
To investigate further the role of Tlr4 at expression levels that are more biologically relevant , we focused our studies on the F1Tg382 and F1Tg388 mice carrying one and three copies respectively of the Tlr4 transgene ( see Materials and methods for a detailed description of the mice used ) . 
Additionally , we were interested in comparing these two transgenic strains to a strain that carries two natural , wild-type ( non-transgenic ) Tlr4 alleles on a similar B10.C3HNramp1 background . 
To achieve this , we generated a double congenic mouse strain , B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 , carrying two wild-type alleles at Tlr4 from the C57BL / 10SnJ strain . 
These three strains allowed direct comparison of the effect of one , two and three copies of Tlr4 on the mouse response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection in the context of a resistant allele at Nramp1 . 
When these mice were infected with B103 colony-forming units ( CFU ) of Salmonella Typhimurium intravenously , we observed a clear effect of the number of copies of the gene . 
The F1Tg388 ( three transgenic copies ) showed the longest survival time , followed by the B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 ( two natural copies ) , and finally by the F1Tg382 ( one transgene ) ( Figure 1 ) . 
The B10.C3H-Nramp1 mice ( no Tlr4 but wild-type Nramp1 ) , B10/SnJ ( Tlr4 but mutated Nramp1 ) and B10/ScNCr ( no Tlr4 and mutated Nramp1 ) were increasingly more susceptible to infection . 
These results confirm the important role of Tlr4 and Nramp1 during in vivo Salmonella infection in the mouse and show for the first time an incremental protection from zero to one , two and three copies of the gene . 
We , thereafter , sought to understand how increasing Tlr4 expression translates into improved resistance to Salmo-nella infection . 
The increased resistance of Tlr4 competent mice compared to mice carrying a nonfunctional Tlr4 allele has been linked to improved control of bacterial growth in the liver .10,15 We were therefore interested in testing the hypothesis that increasing Tlr4 expression would also translate into improved control of bacterial growth in the spleen and liver of mice during infection . 
To verify this hypothesis , we measured the bacterial load in the spleen and liver of our mice at various time points following Salmonella infection . 
As shown in Figure 2 , the F1Tg388 mice were able to control the bacterial load in the spleen and the liver for a longer period of time compared to F1Tg382 or B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 mice . 
Significant differences were observed for the splenic and liver CFU at day 8 for both F1Tg382 and B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 compared to F1Tg388 mice . 
Additionally , a significant difference was detected at day 10 between F1Tg382 and F1Tg388 for splenic CFU . 
These results indicate a role for the level of Tlr4 expression in controlling the bacterial replication during the first 10 days of infection . 
However , in F1Tg388 mice , the spleen and liver bacterial load eventually increased during the late phase of infection to reach lethal numbers around days 15 -- 20 . 
Therefore , the increased protection conferred by incremental Tlr4 expression appears to be limited to the early phase of infection suggesting that despite a robust innate immune response , the host is unable to mount protective adaptive immunity resulting in long-term control of the bacterial replication . 
Given the differences in survival time and bacterial load observed in our mice , we were interested in comparing the histological lesions in the F1Tg382 and the F1Tg388 mice during infection . 
The intravenous injection of Salmonella Typhimurium in these transgenic mice resulted in microscopic changes detected in the liver , spleen , kidney , lung , brain , heart , pancreas and gastrointestinal tract ( including the mesenteric lymph nodes ) at days 5 , 10 , 15 and 19 post-infection . 
There was , however , no obvious intergenotype difference in the severity or nature of these changes at the time points where both lines were available for study ( days 5 and 10 , all F1Tg382 mice dying before day 15 ) . 
The histopathologic lesions were more pronounced in the spleen and the liver where leukocytosis and thrombosis of the venular system were found at all time points , suggesting priming of endothelial cells , activation of circulating leukocytes and activation of the coagulation cascade as a consequence of the intravenous injection of Salmonella . 
These lesions were characterized by multifocal mixed inflammatory cells adhering to a reactive endothelium with or without clusters of inflammatory cells and/or thrombosis present in the lumen of the affected veins ( Figure 3a -- d ) . 
Necroinflammatory and inflammatory changes characterized by multifocal foci of coagulation necrosis were also found in the spleen and the liver and through time , these changes evolved from acute to subacute or chronic ( Figure 3a -- d ) . 
Especially in the liver , bacterial colonies were often seen within these lesions , which most likely represent areas of bacterial localization and replication . 
Splenic histiocytosis was present as early as day 5 post-infection in some mice . 
The incidence and severity of this change seemed to increase at days 10 and 15 post-infection and subsided at day 19 ( Figure 3e -- h ) , indicating massive recruitment of tissue macrophages to the spleen of infected mice . 
Splenic periarteriolar lymphoid sheath atrophy was noted starting at day 5 in some mice but its incidence and severity increased through time to become diffuse and massive at day 19 in the mouse examined ( Figure 3i -- l ) . 
These lesions could reflect a depletion of T lymphocytes and possibly illustrate the failure of the mice to generate an adequate adaptive response and control the infection . 
Extrame-dullary hematopoiesis was also detected in the liver and the spleen of F1Tg388 at days 15 and 19 post-infection . 
Although no intergenotype difference could be detected in the early time points ( days 5 and 10 ) when both strains could be examined , the massive splenic white pulp periarteriolar lymphoid sheath atrophy was observed only in the F1Tg388 mice that survived longer , indicating that death occurred in these strains at similar bacterial load but with different histopathologic lesions .

The spleen is a major organ for the development of innate and adaptive immune responses .16 During Salmo-nella infection , it is one of the main sites for bacterial localization and replication . 
Immune cells are recruited to the spleen during infection and , with increased blood flow and accumulation of inflammatory exsudates , they contribute to the development of a massive splenome-galy . 
The splenic index of mice infected with Salmonella increases more than three times from 0.6 in non-infected mice to sometimes more than 2.0 at day 15 post-infection ( data not shown ) . 
Using flow cytometry analysis , we characterized the cell populations of the spleen during Salmonella infection in F1Tg388 and B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 mice using general leukocytes markers with the aim of identifying Tlr4 copy number-induced differences in cell recruitment . 
As shown in Figure 4 , the major cell populations recruited to the spleen during infection expressed Gr1 and Mac1 , consistent with the observation of infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages seen on histopathologic examination . 
The percentage of cells expressing these markers increased in both groups examined throughout infection to finally plateau at day 15 in the F1Tg388 . 
The major histocompatibility complex class II molecule I-Ab was upregulated in a higher percentage of cells and with a higher mean fluorescence intensity ( data not shown ) at day 4 in both groups , indicating activation of antigen-presenting cells . 
The percentage of cells expressing the B-cell marker IgM declined on days 8 and 15 after a small increase on day 4 . 
The percentage of CD3-positive cells steadily declined throughout infection in both groups , which is in agreement with the depletion of lymphocytes in the periarter-iolar lymphoid sheaths seen on histopathology . 
Dendritic cells were recruited to the spleen during Salmonella infection in both groups , as shown by the increased percentage of CD11c-positive cells . 
Finally , NK cells did not appear to play a major role in mouse salmonellosis with percentages of Pan-NK-positive cells showing a slight decline throughout infection . 
In order to detect potential Tlr4-induced differences in the development of an adaptive response , we also studied the upregulation of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 , CD80 and CD86 on Mac1-positive and CD11c-positive cells at day 4 in B10.C3H-Nramp1 , F1Tg382 , B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 and F1Tg388 . 
Although these molecules were upregulated on both cell types in all four strains of mice , we failed to detect any significant difference between the groups ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicate that the effect of increased Tlr4 expression leading to increased control of bacterial proliferation is not reflected in an obvious difference in the recruitment of effector cells to the spleen . 
The systemic activation of the immune system during infection may be reflected by changes in circulating white blood cells . 
To investigate for potential Tlr4-induced differences in the hematological changes that occur during Salmonella infection , we performed red blood cell and white blood cell counts in F1Tg388 and B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 mice ( Figure 5 ) . 
Both strains of mice developed a severe leukopenia at day 4 post-infection ( Figure 5a ) , indicating acute activation of the immune system caused by intravenous Salmonella infection . 
Again no intergenotype differences were observed except for a more pronounced rebound neutrophilia ( Figure 5c ) and monocytosis ( Figure 5d ) in the B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 mice at day 8 . 
We were , however , surprised to observe the development of anemia in both strains of mice during infection ( Figure 5e ) . 
This anemia worsened throughout infection to become quite severe at day 15 in F1Tg388 mice , probably explaining the extramedullary hematopoiesis observed at days 15 and 19 in these mice . 
To the best of our knowledge , development of anemia in mice during Salmonella infection has not been described previously and we are currently investigating further the mechanisms underlying this pathology . 
In continuing our search for pinpointing a precise mechanism explaining increased resistance to Salmonella brought by incremental expression of Tlr4 , we next compared mRNA expression of immune-related genes in the spleen of our mice during infection using a Tlr4 pathway-specific oligoarray ( SuperArray Bioscience Corporation , Frederick , MD , USA ) . 
The genes from the Tlr4-specific pathway that were the most regulated within each group during infection ( Figure 6 and Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) were selected for study with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR ( qPCR ) . 
This technique was expected to be more sensitive to detect small differences in gene expression that could exist between the groups carrying one , two or three copies of Tlr4 at similar time points . 
The genes selected for qPCR analysis were chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) ligand

Additionally , we investigated the expression of Tlr4 as an internal control for the genotype of our mice and our qPCR technique . 
We observed incremental Tlr4 expression across our three groups at all time points studied ( Figure 7a -- c ) , confirming the validity of our qPCR technique , the genotype of our mice and the correlation between the number of copies of Tlr4 and its mRNA expression . 
Additionally , Tlr4 expression increased in all three groups during Salmonella infection ( Figure 7d -- f ) reflecting either upregulation of its expression on cells normally expressing Tlr4 or the recruitment of Tlr4-expressing cells to the spleen . 
Reasonably good agreement was found between the array and the qPCR results with respect to the overall trend in gene expression during Salmonella infection in our mice . 
The genes that were found to be upregulated during Salmonella infection ( Figure 7d -- f ) all belong to what has been described as the common host response to infection .17 Il1b , encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b , was strongly and similarly upregulated in all three groups at days 4 and 8 post-infection . 
Il12a , Il12b ( at day 4 ) and Ifng were all upregulated during Salmonella infection , indicating activation of the IL-12 -- IFNg axis shown to be important in immunity to Salmonella .18 Cxcl10 , encoding an IFN-inducible chemo-kine important in T-cell recruitment , was also strongly induced by Salmonella infection in a pattern similar to Ifng . 
Two transcription factors , Irf1 and Irf7 , which mediate the effect of IFNs , were also upregulated during infection in all three groups studied . 
Myd88 , a gene extremely important in the Tlr4 signaling cascade leading to rapid production of pro-inflammatory cyto-kines , was induced by infection in our three groups of mice . 
Irf1 , Irf7 and Myd88 are good example of genes that may amplify the host immune response through a positive feedback loop . 
On the other hand , we also detected increased expression of two negative regulators of inflammation in all three groups following infection : Nfkbia and Tollip . 
Whereas IkBa ( encoded by Nfkbia ) is important for sequestration of NF-kB to the cytoplasm , Tollip is believed to be important in terminating TLR signaling during inflammation . 
Our results illustrate the concomitant activation of both positive and negative regulators of the inflammatory response during Salmo-nella infection . 
In addition , our findings demonstrate activation of both arms of the Tlr4 signaling cascade , with Il1b , Il12a and Il12b being good example of Myd88-dependent genes and Cxcl10 , Irf1 and Irf7 representing the activation of the Trif-dependent arm of Tlr4 signaling . 
When we compared gene expression across our three groups at similar time points , we were able to identify small but significant differences in gene expression ( Figure 7a -- c ) . 
For example , when comparing gene expression in non-infected mice ( Figure 7a ) , we could see a tendency for increasing mRNA expression in almost all the genes studied according to the number of copies of Tlr4 of the strains . 
These differences were significant for Il1b ( F1Tg388 vs B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 ) and Ifng ( F1Tg388 vs F1Tg382 and B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 ) . 
On day 4 ( Figure 7b ) , we found that Cxcl10 was overexpressed in the F1Tg388 compared to the two other groups ( significant in F1Tg388 vs F1Tg382 ) . 
Additionally , mRNA expression of Myd88 was significantly higher in the F1Tg388 group compared to both F1Tg382 and B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 . 
Finally , on day 8 ( Figure 7c ) , differences in gene expression for Cxcl10 , Il1b , Ifng and Irf7 were observed between the F1Tg388 and the B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 strain . 
In summary , our results show that although upregulation of these important immune genes during infection occurred with a similar pattern in the three strains studied , some slight but significant differences could be detected between the groups at specific time points . 
The F1Tg388 strain in particular showed higher constitutive expression of specific immune-related transcripts compared to the two other groups . 
These results suggest that increased basal Tlr4 expression in vivo leads to increased expression of downstream immune-related genes in the spleen , which appears to provide a survival advantage following Salmonella infection in mice .

Discussion
In our original description of the Tlr4 transgenic mice , we demonstrated a clear copy number effect on the mouse response to LPS in vitro and in vivo . 
However , the effect of Tlr4 expression on the in vivo mouse resistance to Salmonella infection showed a plateau starting at three copies of the gene .13 The mice carrying six or 30 copies of Tlr4 were less or equally resistant compared to the strain carrying three copies ( Bihl et al13 and data not shown ) . 
In the present study , we further refined our understanding of the role of expression of Tlr4 within a narrow , biologically relevant range , on the host response to Salmonella infection . 
We showed , for the first time , an incremental protective response against Gram-negative sepsis from zero to one , two and three copies of Tlr4 ( Figure 1 ) . 
The small differences in survival between the groups carrying two and three copies of Tlr4 and the lack of benefit from higher levels of Tlr4 expression illustrate the fine balance in gene dosage brought about by millions of years of evolution of the innate immune system . 
Indeed , a recently published phylogenetic analysis of TLRs revealed that most vertebrates have exactly one gene orthologous to each of the TLR family for recognition of specific PAMPs ( except for the TLR1 family , which comprise Tlr1 , Tlr2 , Tlr6 and Tlr10 ) .19 This study suggests that the TLR superfamily of genes is under strong selective pressure for maintenance of the actual repertoire of PAMPs recognition and for maintenance of the gene dosage within each family . 
These conclusions are in agreement with our findings of the effect of Tlr4 gene dosage on the mouse response to Gram-negative infection . 
The small differences in survi-val and bacterial load seen in the narrow range of copy number of Tlr4 from one to three copies suggest that two copies of Tlr4 per genome represents the most advantageous dosage possible for a diploid organism . 
The increased resistance to Salmonella infection in the F1Tg388 correlates with improved control of the bacterial load within the spleen and the liver ( Figure 2 ) . 
Previous studies using Tlr4 wild-type and natural functional knockout mice demonstrated the importance of a functional Tlr4 for the early control of bacterial proliferation9 ,10,15 and establishment of a plateau phase .20 In our study , we show a Tlr4 expression level-dependent mechanism for control of bacterial growth at later time points , approximately from day 5 to day 10 post-infection ( prolongation of the plateau phase ) . 
The exact mechan-ism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear . 
We first believed that increased Tlr4 expression would result in a more robust inflammatory response that would be visible on histopathologic examination . 
However , no obvious differences could be detected . 
Given the low sensibility of histopathologic examination to subtle changes in cell recruitment , we performed fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis to identify potential Tlr4-induced differences . 
Again , we could not detect any major differences between the F1Tg388 and the other strains examined . 
Therefore , the increased resistance and better control of bacterial load probably resides not in the type or quantity of cells recruited to the spleen but in their activation state and the type of cytokine , chemo-kines and antibacterial molecules they produce . 
Using oligoarrays and qPCR for mRNA expression analysis of important immune effectors in the whole spleen of our mice , we found some interesting Tlr4 copy number-induced differences . 
In particular , we detected increased basal expression of IFNg in the F1Tg388 mice compared to the two other strains , indicating that constitutive supra-normal expression of Tlr4 also leads to constitutive supra-normal expression of INFg ( Figure 7a ) . 
Activated T cells synthesize IFNg following IL-12 stimulation . 
Although no significant differences were detected for IL-12 expression , we observed a Tlr4 copy number trend for increased constitutive IL-12a and IL-12b expression , possibly explaining the significant increase in basal IFNg expression . 
The importance of the IL-12 / IFNg axis in the host response to Salmonella is well known in mice and in humans . 
Wild-type mice infected with attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium are capable of controlling the infection whereas IFNg-deficient mice succumb to infection owing to unrestricted growth of the bacteria .21,22 Administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-12 exacerbates the mild disease caused by attenuated Salmonella23 and mice carrying targeted disruption of Il12a or Il12b are more susceptible to Salmonella Enteritidis .24 Moreover , the syndrome of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease illustrates the importance of IL-12 and IFNg in the host response to Salmonella in humans .18 Affected patients carrying a pathogenic mutation in one of the genes coding for the IFNg receptor , the IL-12 receptor or the IL-12 p40 subunit show increased susceptibility to environmental mycobacterial species and Salmonella . 
The IL-12 / IFNg axis is therefore extremely important in immunity against Salmonella , most likely through its effect on the generation of a type 1 adaptive immune response . 
Our observations go along these lines and suggest that increased constitutive expression of Tlr4 leads to increased basal expression of IL-12 and IFNg , which seems to confer a survival advantage when the animal is suddenly confronted to an infectious agent such as Salmonella . 
Despite increased expression of Tlr4 , improved control of bacterial growth and increased survival time , the F1Tg388 mice fail to completely control the infection , indicating that a robust innate immune response against Salmonella infection is not sufficient for survival . 
It is conceivable that the host -- pathogen interactions in this model are such that the host fails to mount a protective adaptive immune response . 
Although mortality from sepsis has long been linked to excessive activation of systemic inflammation , it is now believed that excessive anti-inflammatory response with accompanying immu-nosuppression certainly contributes to mortality in severe sepsis .25 Along these lines , we observed in our mice a severe and diffuse depletion of lymphocytes in the splenic white pulp ( Figure 3j -- l ) , decreasing percen-tages of CD3 þ and IgM þ cells ( Figure 4 ) , and a severe and persistent lymphopenia ( Figure 5b ) at a time where one would expect to see clonal expansion of lymphocytes . 
Depletion of lymphocytes from the splenic white pulp and lymphopenia have been reported in human patients dying from severe sepsis .26 The mechanism underlying lymphocyte depletion during sepsis is believed to be apoptosis , and treatment with apoptosis inhibitor or use of mice with genetic modifications rendering them less susceptible to apoptosis improves survival from polymicrobial sepsis .27,28 It is conceivable that sepsis-induced apoptosis could contribute to the failure of our mice to resolve the infection . 
In addition , we also observed a drop in Il12b expression on day 8 , below the level of expression seen in non-infected mice . 
Given the importance of IL-12 in the mouse response to Salmonella , we could hypothesize that the failure of sustaining IL-12 expression is detrimental to the host . 
Indeed , John et al. 29 have shown that IL-12p40 is essential for a sustained IFNg production by T cells in mice immunized with live Salmonella Typhimurium aroA . 
The study of the effect of the level of expression of Tlr4 within a biologically relevant range is important in light of recent findings regarding the role of human polymorphisms within the TLR4 gene in association with various diseases . 
Two polymorphisms , Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile , were originally described as hyporesponsive in regard to inhaled LPS in healthy human volunteers .30 Following this publication , numerous studies have found an association between these polymorphisms and susceptibility to a wide range of infectious and non-infectious diseases . 
For example , the hypomorphic Tlr4 alleles have been associated with increased risk of 
Gram-negative infection31 or septic shock due to Gram-negative organisms ,32 severe malaria ,33 brucello-sis ,34 Crohn 's disease35 and severe sepsis following burn injury .36 On the other hand , the same alleles have shown protective effects against various diseases such as atherosclerosis ,37 Legionnaire 's disease38 and late-onset Alzheimer 's disease .39 In light of these findings , the mice characterized in the present study could represent invaluable tools to study in more depth the role of slightly different levels of Tlr4 expression in specific diseases outcome and pathophysiology . 
In conclusion , we provide evidence for a Tlr4 expression level-induced difference in mouse survival following Salmonella infection due to improved control of bacterial growth in the spleen and the liver and increased expression of relevant immune genes at the site of infection . 
The lack of striking differences in some of the specific measurements made during infection in our three mice strains should not be surprising . 
We were in fact looking at three almost identical mice strains that differed only by one or two copies of the Tlr4 gene , each of them possessing at least one copy . 
Therefore , it was probably only possible to detect differences by using methods that are very sensitive to small changes , such as mRNA qPCR expression analysis . 
The differences in survival and bacterial load were however noticeable and must be explained by some subtle Tlr4 copy number-induced change in the host response to the invasive pathogen occurring at the cellular level . 
The subtle changes we detected in whole spleen mRNA expression give an indication of the possible mechanisms underlying the increased resistance in the F1Tg388 mice . 
Further experiments should allow a better understanding of the real biological impact of these subtle changes in gene expression . 
methods
Transgenic mice carrying different copy numbers of Tlr4 were generated in our laboratory13 and were maintained at the Montreal General Hospital Research Institute ( MGHRI ) animal facility under conditions specified by the Canadian Council on Animal Care ( CCAC ) . 
These mice carry a 129S6/SvEvTac Tlr4 BAC transgene on a B10/ScNCr background . 
The original B10/ScNCr strain has no Tlr4 because of a 75 kb chromosomal deletion encompassing the Tlr4 locus40 and carries a mutated , nonfunctional allele at Nramp1 ( Nramp1Asp169 ) ) .41 Because of the known major effect of Nramp1 on mouse salmo-nellosis , we generated a congenic strain , B10/ScNCr . 
C3H-Nramp1 ( or B10.C3H-Nramp1 ) , through 10 consecutives backcross generations to be used in a cross with our transgenic strain . 
The B10.C3H-Nramp1 mice are now maintained in a wild-type Nramp1Gly169 homozygote state at the MGHRI animal facility . 
( Tg B10.C3H-Nramp1 ) F1 mice carrying the transgene and one wild-type allele at Nramp1 are used in experimental infection with Salmo-nella Typhimurium . 
We refer to these mice as F1Tg382 ( one copy of the Tlr4 transgene and one wild-type allele at Nramp1 ) and F1Tg388 ( three copies of the Tlr4 transgene and one wild-type allele at Nramp1 ) . 
A double congenic strain , C57BL/10ScNCr . 
Cg-Nramp1Gly169Tlr4-Pro712 ( abbreviated B10.Cg-Nramp1 / Tlr4 ) , was generated through backcrossing of Tlr4 from C57BL/10SnJ onto a B10.C3H-Nramp1 background . 
The mice used in our infections are homozygote wild type at Tlr4 and heterozygote at Nramp1 ( Gly169/Asp169 ) in concordance with the F1Tg mice . 
C57BL/10ScNCr ( maintained at the MGHRI animal facility ) and C57BL/10SnJ ( obtained from the Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine , USA ) were used as controls . 
At the time of infection , all mice were aged between 2 and 6 months . 
In vivo Salmonella infection
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations of the CCAC . 
Salmonella Typhimur-ium strain Keller was grown in trypticase soy broth at 371C for 1.5 h followed by enumeration of the CFU by incubating 10-fold serial dilutions on trypticase soy agar at 371C for 16 h. Each mouse was infected with 0.2 ml of 0.9 % saline containing B103 CFU of Salmonella Typhi-murium by intravenous injection in the tail vein . 
The inoculation dose was verified by plating 10-fold serial dilutions of the dose on agar plates . 
For survival analysis , animals were monitored twice a day and moribund animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation . 
For determination of the splenic and hepatic bacterial loads , mice were killed at various time points after infection and half of the spleen and the left lateral lobe of the liver were collected aseptically , weighed and homo-genized with a Polytron homogenizer in isotonic saline . 
Serial dilutions of each homogenate were plated on trypticase soy agar to enumerate the colony-forming units within each organ . 
For histopathologic examination , mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine intramuscularly and perfused first with 20 ml of physiologic saline followed by 20 ml of fresh 4 % paraformal-dehyde . 
The organs were harvested , placed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for several hours , washed in phos-phate-buffered saline ( PBS ) twice and stored in 20 % sucrose-PBS at 41C . 
Tissue processing and histopathlogic examinations were performed by CTBR Bio-Research Inc. ( Senneville , Québec , Canada ) . 
The splenic index was calculated as follow : SI 1/4 O ( spleen wt 100/body wt ) . 
Materials and Animal used 
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions of spleens harvested from mice killed before or at various time points following infection with Salmonella were prepared as previously described .42 The various cell populations were determined by singlecolor staining of the cells with fluorescein isothiocyanateor phytoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against Mac-1 ( CD11b , clone M1/70 , rat IgG2b ) , Gr-1 ( Ly-6G and Ly-6C , clone RB6-8C5 , rat IgG2b ) , CD3e ( clone 145-2C11 , hamster IgG1 ) , CD11c ( clone HL3 , hamster IgG1 ) , CD49b/Pan-NK ( clone DX5 , rat IgM ) , I-Ab ( clone AF6-120 .1 , mouse ( BALB/c ) IgG2a ) and IgM ( clone R6-60 .2 , rat IgG2a ) . 
CD16/CD32 ( clone 2.4 G2 , rat IgG2b ) was used before staining to block the nonspecific binding by Fc receptors . 
All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences ( Mississauga , ON , Canada ) . 
Cell acquisition and data analysis was performed with CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences ) . 
Results are shown as the mean percentage of positively stained cells per spleen . 
Hematologic parameters
Red blood cells were counted manually after dilution in PBS . 
White blood cell counts were also made manually after dilution in 3 % acetic acid . 
Leukocyte differentials were determined by counting 400 leukocytes on Diff Quick-stained blood smears . 
Tlr4 pathway-specific oligoarray
Half of the spleens were harvested immediately after the mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at 801C . 
Approximately 50 mg of spleen was homogenized using a mortar and pestle kept on dry ice and RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent ( Invitrogen , Burlington , ON , Canada ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
cRNA targets for microarray hybridization were synthesized using the TrueLabeling-AMP Linear RNA Amplification kit from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation according to the manufacturer 's instructions using biotin-16-dUTP for labeling . 
The synthesized probes were purified using the RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) . 
The probes were hybridized to the OligoGEArray Mouse Toll-like Receptor Signaling Pathway Microarray ( SuperArray Bioscience Corporation ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
RNA from infected ( three mice per group per time point ) and non-infected ( two mice per group ) male mice was used to hybridize the arrays ( RNA from a single mouse per array for a total of 24 arrays ) . 
The array images were acquired by exposing X-ray films and digitalized with a desktop scanner . 
The images and the data were analyzed using the GEArray Expression Analysis Suite . 
Background correction was made by subtracting the local background and normalization was performed using four housekeeping genes present on the arrays . 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
The same RNA samples used for array hybridization were used for qPCR analysis . 
cDNA was synthesized all at once using M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . 
All primers were designed to overlap two exons and primer specificity was verified by ensuring a single band of the expected size on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel . 
Standards were prepared from 10-fold serial dilutions of the gel-extracted PCR product for all genes tested . 
qPCR was performed on Chromo4 Real-Time PCR Detection System ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Mississau-ga , ON , Canada ) using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . 
All samples were amplified in triplicate during the same PCR run on 96-well plates . 
Three potential housekeeping genes were tested ( Polymerase ( RNA ) II ( DNA directed ) polypeptide A ( Polr2a ) , TATA box binding protein ( Tbp ) and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase X-linked ( G6pdx ) ) and the best housekeeping genes were chosen after analysis in Bestkeeper .43 Polr2a and Tbp were found to be stable across our groups and experimental conditions and they were incorporated into a Bestkeeper Index used for relative quantification . 
PCR amplification efficiencies were measured on individual amplification plots using LinReg PCR .44 The software REST 384 ( http://www . 
gene-quantification . 
info / ) 45 was used to analyze the relative expression of our measured transcripts using an efficiency corrected ratio . 
Error estimations of the calculated ratios were obtained using a Taylor 's series as implemented in REST . 
The significance of the difference in expression ratios across our groups or experimental time points was investigated using pairwise fixed randomization tests implemented in REST ( 2000 rando-mizations for each test ) .
