Summary 
Drug efﬂux systems play a major role in resistance to a wide range of noxious compounds in several Gram negative species . 
Here , we report the drug resistance and virulence phenotypes of Salmonella mutants defective in either resistance-nodulation-division ( RND ) - type systems and/or in drug efﬂux systems belonging to the major facilitator ( MFS ) , multidrug and toxic compound extrusion ( MATE ) , and ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) superfamilies . 
We determined that nine potential drug transporters contribute to drug resistance of Salmonella and found that the Salmonella-speciﬁc MdsABC system conferred resistance to a variety of toxic compounds . 
The RND-type MdsAB system could function with either MdsC , which is encoded in the same operon , or TolC as the outer membrane component . 
Although the Salmo-nella EmrAB , MdfA and MdtK are 90 % identical in their amino acid sequences to their Escherichia coli homologues , the drug speciﬁcity of Salmonella transport-ers was different from that reported for equivalent E. coli transporters . 
Deletion of the macAB genes attenuated Salmonella virulence and a strain lacking all drug efﬂux systems was avirulent when mice were inoculated by the oral route . 
The promoter region of the macAB drug efﬂux system genes harbours a binding site for the response regulator PhoP , which functions to repress macAB transcription.The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is a major regulator of Salmo-nella virulence , which underscores the connection between drug efﬂux systems and virulence .

chemotherapy and the treatment of bacterial infections . 
In bacteria , resistance to drugs is often associated with multidrug transporters functioning to decrease cellular drug accumulation ( Nikaido , 1996 ; Zgurskaya and Nikaido , 2000 ) . 
In Gram negative bacteria , the pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division ( RND ) family are especially effective in generating resistance , as they form a tripartite complex together with the periplasmic proteins belonging to the membrane-fusion-protein ( MFP ) family and the outer membrane channels , so that drugs are pumped out directly to the external medium . 
The RND pumps often have a wide substrate speciﬁcity ( Yu et al. , 2003 ) . 
Salmonella enterica is a pathogen that causes a variety of diseases in humans ranging from gastroenteritis to bacteremia and typhoid fever ( Scherer and Miller , 2001 ) . 
In the 1990s , the prevalence of multidrug-resistant S. enterica has increased dramatically in the United Kingdom ( Threlfall et al. , 1996 ; 1997 ) , the United States ( Hosek et al. , 1997 ; Glynn et al. , 1998 ) and Canada ( Ng et al. , 1999 ) . 
Many countries have also documented outbreaks associated with drug-resistant Salmonella in poultry , beef and swine ( Davies et al. , 1996 ; Cody et al. , 1999 ; Grein et al. , 1999 ; Molbak et al. , 1999 ; Villar et al. , 1999 ) . 
Emerging resistance to these antibiotics in Salmonella has been found in both humans and animals and is thus a potentially serious public health problem ( Cloeckaert and Chaslus-Dancla , 2001 ; Piddock , 2002 ) . 
High-level ﬂu-oroquinolone resistance in S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium phage type DT204 has been previously shown to be essentially due to both multiple target gene mutations and active efﬂux by the AcrAB-TolC efﬂux system ( Baucheron et al. , 2002 ; 2004 ) . 
The determination of bacterial genome sequences enables us to trace putative drug resistance genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium genome ( Paulsen et al. , 1998 ; 2000 ) . 
For example , ﬁve putative drug efﬂux systems belonging to the RND family have been annotated ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Ren et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , the transport ability , as well as their roles in drug resistance and virulence of these systems , has remained unknown except for the AcrAB , AcrD and AcrEF systems ( Nikaido et al. , 1998 ; Eaves et al. , 2004 ; Olliver et al. , 2005 ) . 
TolC is required for virulence of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in mice ( Stone and Miller , 1995 ) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in chicks ( Baucheron et al. , 2005 ) and AcrB is required for virulence of S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium ( Lacroix et al. , 1996 ) , suggesting that drug transport-ers may contribute not only to drug resistance but also to virulence . 
The successful infection by a bacterial pathogen relies upon its ability to sense and to respond to its immediate environment . 
Salmonella encounter different potentially lethal environments during infection of an animal host . 
For example , Salmonella must resist the action of intestinal bile salts , which are detergents made by the liver and secreted into and stored in high concentrations in the gallbladder . 
Bile containing these salts is released into the intestine to aid in the dispersion and degradation of fats . 
Enteric bacteria , including Salmonella , are resistant to the effects of bile ( Gunn , 2000 ) . 
Both serovars Typhimurium and Typhi demonstrate particularly high resistance to bile ( minimal bactericidal concentrations : > 60 % and 18 % respectively ) , which exceeds the concentrations Salmo-nella would encounter during infection ( van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ) . 
High-level resistance to bile has been shown to be dependent upon the AcrAB-TolC drug efﬂux system ( Nikaido et al. , 1998 ) , and PhoP/PhoQ , a two-component regulatory system necessary for virulence ( see Groisman , 2001 for a review ) . 
Mutants defective in phoP/phoQ are also sensitive to antimicrobial peptides and acid pH ( Foster and Hall , 1990 ; Groisman et al. , 1992 ; 1997 ) . 
PhoP activates genes ( pags ) required for intramac-rophage survival and resistance against host antimicrobial peptides ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Groisman et al. , 1992 ; Groisman , 2001 ) , and represses genes ( prgs ) , including those encoded in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) , that are required for invasion of host epithelial cells ( Behlau and Miller , 1993 ) . 
Here , we report the drug resistance and virulence roles of potential drug transporters of S. enterica belonging to the RND , MFS ( major facilitator ) , MATE ( multidrug and toxic compound extrusion ) and ABC ( ATP-binding cassette ) superfamilies . 
We show that all nine potential drug transporter genes contribute to drug resistance of S. enterica , that inactivation of all drug efﬂux pumps attenuates virulence , and that the PhoP/PhoQ system controls expression of one of these drug efﬂux systems that is required for virulence for mice . 
Results
Identiﬁcation of potential multidrug exporter genes
Genomic analyses revealed that Salmonella has ﬁve putative RND transporter systems ( Fig. 1 ) ( Paulsen et al. , 1998 ; http://www.membranetransport.org/ ) . 
Although there are six genes coding for RND transporters ( Fig. 1 ) , we counted them as ﬁve systems because the MdtB and MdtC proteins function as one transporter system in Escherichia coli ( Nagakubo et al. 2002 ) . 
Four of these 
Role of drug transporter genes in resistance to toxic compounds
To investigate the contribution of potential drug transport-ers in resistance to toxic compounds , we made derivatives of the wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028s strain lacking individual RND drug transporter genes , the tolC gene , or genes belonging to the MFS ( emrAB and mdfA ) , MATE ( mdtK ) and ABC ( macAB ) transporter families ( Table 1 ) . 
Deletion of the tolC , acrB or acrAB genes resulted in strains with increased susceptibility to all 16 antimicrobial agents and chemical compounds tested ( Table 2 ) . 
The acrB , acrAB and tolC mutant strains have overlapping substrate susceptibility proﬁles , which is in agreement with the notion that the encoded proteins interact as a tripartite pump system . 
It is worth noting that the ∆ tolC mutant was more susceptible to certain compounds including novobiocin , sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) and sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) , than the acrAB mutant ( Table 2 ) , which is in good agreement with a recent report ( Baucheron et al. , 2005 ) . 
When the acrD and acrEF genes were deleted from the acrAB mutant , the resulting strain showed slightly increased susceptibility to DOC . 
A ∆ acrAB acrEF acrD mdtABC mutant was more sensitive to novobiocin , SDS and DOC . 
Deletion of the emrAB genes from the ∆ acrAB acrEF acrD mdtABC mdsABC increased susceptibility to DOC ( Table 2 ) . 
The AcrEF , AcrD , MdtABC and EmrAB systems of E. coli rely on TolC as their outer membrane component for their functions ( Fralick , 1996 ; Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; 2004 ; Nishino et al. , 2003a ) . 
On the other hand , strains deleted for the acrD , acrEF , mdtABC , mdsABC , emrAB , mdfA , mdtK or macAB genes exhibited the same drug susceptibility as the wild-type strain . 
and when both the emrAB and mdfA genes were deleted , the resulting strain retained wild-type susceptibility to the tested compounds . 
We considered three possibilities to explain the reason why the latter deletions had no effect on drug susceptibility . 
One possibility is that the effect of the single or double gene deletions might be masked by the presence of a functional AcrAB system . 
The second possibility is that the deleted genes might not be expressed under the tested condition . 
And third , the deleted genes might not code for drug exporters . 
To investigate the ﬁrst possibility , we constructed strains with deletions in both : the genes corresponding to the RND family of transporters and the acrB gene . 
The acrEF acrB double mutant displayed a slightly increased susceptibility to doxorubicin , ethidium bromide and DOC , whereas the acrD acrB , acrEF acrB and mdtABC acrB double mutants were more susceptible to DOC ( Table 2 ) . 
A strain with all nine potential drug export-ers deleted was more sensitive to novobiocin , SDS and DOC compared with the ∆ acrAB mutant . 
The minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) values of these compounds for this mutant were almost the same as those found with the tolC mutant ( Table 2 ) . 
While this result supports the ﬁrst of the possibilities , the effect of deletion of putative drug exporter genes on drug susceptibilities was much smaller than the effect of deleting acrB . 
To investigate whether the putative drug transporter genes were expressed under laboratory conditions , we streaked out onto X-Gal Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) agar plates strains in which the E. coli lacZY genes replaced the chromosomal copy of the drug resistance genes ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The tolC-lacZY and acrA-lacZY strains were blue on plates − 1 containing 80 µg ml of X-Gal , whereas the acrD-lacZY , emrA-lacZY , mdfA-lacZY , mdtK-lacZY and macA-lacZY strains were only faint blue ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Thus , the AcrAB-TolC efﬂux system is expressed in complex laboratory media , whereas the other efﬂux systems appear to require additional cues for expression [ e.g. induction of the emrAB genes inside macrophages ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) ] . 
We then cloned all nine putative drug transporter genes into the multicopy number plasmid pUC118 , and investigated their ability to confer drug resistance upon the Salmonella acrB mutant . 
The plasmids carrying the acrAB or acrEF genes conferred multidrug resistance against all tested compounds ( Table 3 ) .

ulence and drug resistance roles of drug efﬂux pumps 127 systems -- AcrAB , AcrD , AcrEF and MdtABC -- have homologues in E. coli with which they exhibit ∼ 90 % amino acid identity ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In E. coli , the function of all four transporters requires the outer membrane channel TolC ( Nishino et al. , 2003a ) , which also exists in S. enterica ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Except for the acrD gene , all RND efﬂux system genes also code for a MFP in the same operon ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The ﬁfth putative RND transporter is encoded by the Salmonella-speciﬁc STM0351 gene , which is ﬂanked by Salmonella-speciﬁc genes encoding a putative MFP and an outer membrane protein ( STM0352 and STM0350 respectively ) . 
A BLAST search showed that the most closely related open reading frames ( ORFs ) to STM0350 , STM0351 and STM0352 are the oprM , mexF and mexE ORFs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively . 
We propose to rename STM0352 , STM0351 , STM0350 as mdsA , mdsB , mdsC respectively ( mds for multidrug transporter of Salmonella ) .

Overexpression of the emrAB genes conferred resistance against novobiocin , nalidixic acid , rhodamine 6G and DOC . 
The mdfA gene conferred resistance to tetracycline , chloramphenicol , norﬂoxacin , and doxorubicin ; the mdtK gene to norﬂoxacin , doxorubicin and acriﬂavine ; and the macAB gene to erythromycin . 
These results indicate that all nine identiﬁed drug transporter genes encode functional systems that appear to differ in their substrate speciﬁcity .

∆ acrB mdsABC and ∆ acrB tolC mdsABC strains . 
Overexpression of both the mdsABC and mdsAB genes conferred drug resistance to the ∆ acrB mdsABC strain ( Table 4 ) . 
On the other hand , overexpression of mdsABC , but not mdsAB , conferred drug resistance to the ∆ acrB tolC mdsABC strain ( Table 4 ) . 
These data indicate that the drug resistance phenotype conferred by the MdsAB system is dependent on the presence of either the MdsC or TolC proteins ; and it suggests that the MdsAB system can function with both TolC and MdsC as outer membrane component . 
Virulence role of drug transporters
We inoculated BALB/c mice by the oral route with isogenic strains harbouring deletions in drug transporter genes and followed mouse survival over time . 
The mutation in tolC attenuated virulence ( Fig. 3 ) , as previously reported for a S. enterica serovar Enteritidis tolC mutant ( Stone and 
Miller , 1995 ) . 
Among the RND-type transporters , MdtABC and MdsABC were required for full virulence . 
There was a small delay in mortality of mice inoculated with the ∆ acrAB and ∆ acrEF mutants . 
A mutant lacking all RND-type transporter genes was attenuated , like the tolC mutant . 
Of the MFS , MATE and ABC-type drug transport-ers , MacAB was required for virulence . 
Finally , a strain deleted for all nine drug transporter genes was unable to kill mice ( Fig. 3 ) even though its growth in LB media was normal . 
These results indicate that drug efﬂux genes are required for Salmonella 's ability to cause a lethal infection in mice . 
The PhoP-PhoQ virulence regulatory system controls transcription of the macAB drug exporter genes
Because the PhoP/PhoQ system is required for resistance to bile salts ( van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ) , and because certain drug transporters have been implicated in resistance to bile salts , we investigated the possibility that the PhoP protein may regulate expression of the drug transporter genes . 
Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , we determined that the expression levels of the macA and macB genes were lower in organisms growing in low Mg2 + than in those experiencing high Mg2 + ( Fig. 4A ) . 
This is in contrast to the expression of other drug transporter genes , which was not affected by Mg2 + ( data not shown ) . 
Moreover , the macA and macB genes were expressed to higher levels in a phoP mutant than in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that these genes are repressed by PhoP as low Mg2 + is the signal that activates the PhoP/PhoQ system ( Groisman , 2001 ) . 
Using the Gene Promoter Scan ( GPS ) tool ( Zwir et al. , 2005a , b ) , we identiﬁed a sequence resembling the PhoP box in the region upstream of the macAB operon ( Fig. 4B ) . 
The identiﬁed region is a bona ﬁde PhoP-binding site as DNase I footprinting analysis with the puriﬁed PhoP-His6 protein showed protection of the region upstream of the macA ORF ( Fig. 4C ) . 
This indicates that PhoP exerts its repression effect directly ( Fig. 4D ) .

Discussion
We have demonstrated that S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium possesses ﬁve RND-type drug efﬂux systems and four efﬂux systems belonging to the MFS , MATE and ABC families . 
The Salmonella-speciﬁc RND-type efﬂux system MdsABC conferred resistance to a variety of toxic compounds . 
In E. coli , the operons coding for RND-type drug transporter genes lack genes for outer membrane proteins ( Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001a ) because they rely on TolC as their outer membrane component for their functions ( Fralick , 1996 ; Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; 2004 ; Nishino et al. , 2003a ) . 
This is in contrast to the operons containing RND-type drug transporter genes of P. aeruginosa , which usually have outer membrane protein genes ( i.e. mexA-mexB-oprM , mexC-mexD-oprJ , mexE-mexF-oprN ) ( Poole , 2004 ) . 
While S. enterica does not have a homologue of the MdtEF ( YhiUV ) transporter system of E. coli , it harbours a unique drug efﬂux system operon -- mdsABC -- that codes for the putative outer membrane protein MdsC . 
The MdsAB system can use either MdsC or TolC as the outer membrane component ( Table 4 ) . 
Of the nine drug efﬂux systems of Salmonella , only the AcrAB-TolC system was expressed on complex media . 
This is the likely reason that , except for AcrAB-TolC , single deletions of efﬂux systems genes had no signiﬁcant effect on drug susceptibility . 
On the other hand , when these transporters were expressed from a heterologous promoter in a drug-sensitive mutant , we could establish that they encode functional efﬂux pumps . 
The substrate the possibility that the MacAB system may have a spe-ciﬁc role in detoxifying natural compounds encountered during infection . 
Because the PhoP/PhoQ system is required for virulence ( Groisman , 2001 ) and for resistance to bile salts of S. enterica ( van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ) , and because drug transporters are also required for virulence and resistance to bile salts ( Thanassi et al. , 1997 ) , we investigated the possibility that the PhoP protein may regulate their expression . 
We demonstrated that the PhoP protein binds to a site in the intergenic region between the somA gene and the macAB ABC-transporter genes . 
somA is a PhoP-activated gene that has been implicated in virulence in mice and is induced inside macrophages ( Detweiler et al. , 2003 ) . 
We have now determined that the macAB operon is a PhoP-repressed locus ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The existence of a pair of divergently transcribed genes , one being activated and the other repressed by PhoP ( Fig. 4D ) , is reminiscent of the mode of transcription regulation of the divergently transcribed mgtA and treR genes of E. coli : while mgtA is activated , treR is repressed by PhoP ( Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) . 
Because PhoP-activated genes are required for intramacrophage survival ( Groisman , 2001 ) and resistance against host antimicrobial peptides ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Groisman et al. , 1992 ) , and PhoP-repressed genes participate in invasion of epithelial cells ( Behlau and Miller , 1993 ; Bajaj et al. , 1996 ) , our results suggest that during infection of a mammalian host the macAB genes mediate a Salmonella activity outside host cells .

ulence and drug resistance roles of drug efﬂux pumps 133 speciﬁcity of all RND-type drug efﬂux pumps of S. enterica were similar to those of the pumps of E. coli , the exception being MdsABC . 
Expression of the AcrAB and AcrEF protein gave multidrug resistance against all investigated compounds ( Table 3 ) . 
AcrD and MdtABC conferred resistance against novobiocin , SDS and DOC to S. enterica cells . 
The contribution of the Salmonella MacAB system to erythromycin resistance is smaller than that of the E. coli MacAB ( Kobayashi et al. , 2001 ; 2003 ) with which it exhibits 83 % amino acid identity . 
The susceptibilities of Salmonella expressing the EmrAB , MdfA and MdtK systems was somewhat different from those of the equivalent E. coli strains , even though the corresponding proteins are 90 % identical . 
The Salmonella EmrAB system confers resistance against novobiocin and nalidixic acid whereas the E. coli EmrAB does not ( Lomovskaya and Lewis , 1992 ; Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001a ) . 
On the other hand , the Salmonella EmrAB does not confer resistance to carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone ( CCCP ) ( data not shown ) whereas E. coli EmrAB does ( Lomovskaya and Lewis , 1992 ; Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001a ) . 
Salmonella MdfA does not confer resistance against acriﬂavine , ethidium bromide and TPP whereas the E. coli MdfA does ( Edgar and Bibi , 1997 ; Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001a ) . 
Salmo-nella MdtK ( YdhE ) does not confer TPP and DOC resistance unlike the E. coli MdtK ( Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001a ) . 
These phenotypic differences could be due to the small number of amino acid substitutions having critical effects on the substrate speciﬁcities of multidrug efﬂux pumps as previously reported ( Edgar and Bibi , 1999 ; Adler and Bibi , 2004 ; 2005 ) . 
Alternatively or in addition , the differences in drug susceptibilities could be due to species-speciﬁc genes . 
We have now shown that deletion of single drug efﬂux pump genes had no signiﬁcant effects on drug resistance , except for the acrAB mutant . 
However , when the all nine drug efﬂux pumps were simultaneously deleted in a single strain , Salmonella became sensitive to several compounds including DOC , even more susceptible than the acrAB-deleted strain . 
The tolC mutant was more sensitive to DOC than the acrAB mutant , and when all efﬂux systems were deleted in a single strain , the resulting mutant showed hypersensitivity to DOC to the same level as the tolC mutant , probably because most of the transporters require TolC for function ( Nishino et al. , 2003a ) . 
Moreover , Salmonella was completely attenuated in mice when the nine drug transporter genes were deleted , which is different from the phenotype of a strain deleted only for the acrAB genes . 
This avirulent phenotype could be due to hypersensitivity of the mutant against DOC that is one of the primary constituents of bile . 
Furthermore , deletion of the macAB genes attenuated Salmonella virulence more than mutation of the tolC gene . 
This raises

Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are derived from the wild-type strain ATCC 14028s . 
Phage P22-mediated transductions were performed as described ( Davis et al. , 1980 ) . 
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C in LB broth , or , for the determination of speciﬁc transcript levels , they were grown in N-minimal media with 10 mM or 10 µM MgCl2 , pH 7.7 . 
Plasmid constructions
The acrAB , acrD , acrEF , mdtABC , mdsABC , emrAB , mdfA , mdtK and macAB genes were ampliﬁed from strain ATCC14028s genomic DNA by PCR with primers listed in Table 5 , which introduced restriction enzyme sites at both ends of the ampliﬁed fragments . 
The PCR fragments were cloned between the BamHI and SphI sites ( SmaI and XbaI sites for mdtABC ) of vector pUC118 , which resulted in these genes being present in the same orientation and downstream of the lac promoter in the pUC118 vector . 
The nucleotide sequences of the recombinant plasmids were determined with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyser .

Construction of gene deletion mutants
Gene disruption was performed as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
The chloramphenicol resistance cat gene or the kanamycin resistance kan gene , ﬂanked by Flp recognition sites , was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers listed in Table 5 . 
The resulting PCR products were used to transform the recipient ATCC14028s strain harbouring plasmid pKD46 , which expresses Red recombinase . 
The chromosomal structure of the mutated loci was veriﬁed both by PCR as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) , and by Southern hybridization using probes speciﬁc to : ( i ) the antibitotic resistance genes used during the construction of the chromosomal deletions , and ( ii ) sequences ﬂanking the inactivated loci . 
Then , the deletions were transferred to the wild-type ATCC14028s strain by P22 transduction . 
The cat and kan genes were eliminated by using plasmid pCP20 as described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
Determination of the MIC for toxic compounds
The antibacterial activities of different agents were determined on L agar ( 1 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , 0.5 % NaCl ) plates containing the compounds ( Sigma ) at various concentrations as indicated in Tables 2 and 3 . 
Agar plates were made by the twofold agar dilution technique as described ( Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2001b ; 2004 ; Nishino et al. , 2005 ) . 
To determine the MICs , bacteria were grown in LB broth at 37 °C overnight , cells were diluted into the same media , and organisms were tested at a ﬁnal inoculum size of 104 cfu µl − 1 with the use of a multipoint inoculator ( Sakuma Seisakusyo , Tokyo , Japan ) , following incubation at 37 °C for 20 h . 
The MIC was the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited cell growth . 
Construction of targeted single copy lac fusion strains
Construction of a chromosomal lacZY fusion strains was done as described ( Ellermeier et al. , 2002 ) . 
A cat or kan cassette was ampliﬁed from pKD3 or pKD4 plasmid using primers listed in Table 5 and drug transporter genes were disrupted by the one-step gene-inactivation method ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
After removing the cat or kan cassette using plasmid pCP20 , the lacZY transcriptional fusion plasmid pCE37 was integrated into the Flp target sequence downstream of the promoter of the drug efﬂux genes by Flp-mediated recombination . 
Thus , the resulting strains were deleted for the drug efﬂux genes .

Bacteria were grown overnight ( 12 -- 14 h ) in LB broth with aeration at 37 °C and then cells were harvested , washed and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
A 5 total of 10 bacterial cells were used to infect intragastrically groups of virus-free 7-week-old BALB/c female mice . 
The course of infection and survival was recorded for 3 weeks . 
RNA extraction
Bacteria were grown in N-minimal media with 10 mM MgCl2 at 37 °C overnight , washed and used to inoculate N-minimal media with 10 mM or 10 µM MgCl2 , pH 7.7 . 
Bacteria were rapidly collected when the cultures reached an OD600 of 0.3 . 
Total RNA was isolated from bacterial cultures with the RNeasy Protect Bacteria mini kit ( QIAGEN ) and RNase-free DNase ( QIAGEN ) as described ( Nishino and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; Nishino et al. , 2003b ) . 
The absence of genomic DNA in DNase-treated RNA samples was conﬁrmed both by inspecting non-denaturing agarose electrophoresis gels and by performing PCR with primers targeting the genomic DNA . 
The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
Determination of speciﬁc transcript levels by quantitative real-time PCR
Bulk cDNA samples were synthesized from total RNA deriverd from bacterial cells by using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents ( PE Applied Biosystems ) and random hexamers as primers . 
Speciﬁc primer pairs were designed with the ABI PRISM Primer Express software ( PE Applied Biosystems ) . 
The rrs gene of the 16S rRNA gene was chosen as the normalizing gene . 
The sequences of the primers are listed in Table 5 . 
Real-time PCR was performed with each speciﬁc primer pair by using SYBR Green PCR master mixture ( PE Applied Biosystems ) . 
The reactions were performed with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system ( PE Applied Biosystems ) , and during the reactions the ﬂuorescence signal due to SYBR Green intercalation was monitored to quantify the amount of double-stranded DNA product formed in each PCR cycle . 
DNase I footprinting
Footprinting was conducted as described ( Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ) using puriﬁed PhoP-His6 protein from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and DNA fragments generated by the PCR with primers 5414 , 5415 and 14028s chromosomal DNA as the template . 
Primer 5415 was labelled with 32P before the PCR . 
The PhoP-His6 protein was overproduced in E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) harbouring plasmid pSC2-phoP and puriﬁed as described ( Chamnongpol and Groisman , 2000 ) with the modiﬁcations described below . 
After puriﬁcation , the eluate was dialysed overnight against 20 mM
