Abstract 
The expression and regulatory properties of a propionate-regulated overexpression system ( Salmonella enterica prpBCDE promoter ( PprpB ) and positive regulator ( prpR ) ) were evaluated in wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium TR6583 and prpB − or prpD − versions of this strain and compared with the arabinose-regulated T7 expression system . 
The wild-type strain showed low expression in the absence of propionate and high expression in the presence of propionate under all growth conditions . 
In 96-well plates and culture tubes , the wild-type strain exhibited a long delay before full induction ; the time delay was significantly shorter in shake flasks . 
The prpD − strain exhibited low expression in the presence of glucose , highly regulatable expression over a wide range of propionate concentrations , and , in contrast to the wild-type strain , fast induction to full expression under all growth conditions . 
In contrast , the prpB − strain showed very high background expression in both culture tubes and shake flasks .

Introduction 
The T7-based expression systems have been used for overexpression of recombinant proteins in Salmonella strains ( McKinney et al. , 2002 ; Santiago-Machuca et al. , 2002 ) . 
However , these systems have high leaky expression leading to inconsistency in expression and instability of the clones ( Santiago-Machuca et al. , 2002 ) . 
Promoters typically used for high-level protein production should have high maximal expression , low un-induced expression , consistent expression in all cells of a culture , and an inexpensive inducer . 
Recently , a new T7 expression system in Escherichia coli and Salmonella

doi :10.1016 / j.gene .2006.02.013 has been constructed to facilitate tightly regulated gene expression by expressing the gene encoding the T7 RNA polymerase on the chromosome under control of araC-PBAD ( Chao et al. , 2002 ; McKinney et al. , 2002 ) . 
The new PBAD-T7 system is not without problems . 
The first problem is that the cell population consists of both induced and uninduced cells at subsaturating L-arabinose concentrations due to active uptake of arabinose by two independent transport systems , araE and araFG operons ( Lee et al. , 1982 ; Siegele and Hu , 1997 ) . 
Since arabinose does not have a synthetic analogue that can freely diffuse across the cell membrane , the arabinose transport genes were placed under control of a constitutive promoter to alleviate the all-or-none expression ( Khlebnikov et al. , 2000 ) . 
Although arabinose is 10-fold less expensive than IPTG ( Wycuff and Matthews , 2000 ) , the arabinose-inducible T7 system has the practical difficulty that arabinose is quite expensive for large-scale protein production because PBAD requires a saturating L-arabinose concentration up to 0.2 % ( 2 g/l ) for full induction . 
Propionate is about 30-fold less expensive than arabinose per gram . 
If 20 mM ( 1.92 g/l ) propionate is required for ful induction of the pPro system , the cost savings in large bioreactors can be significant . 
Recently , it has been reported that propionate , a membrane-permeable weak acid ( Blankenhorn et al. , 1999 ) , is metabolized into pyruvate and succinate by the four enzymes ( PrpBCDE ) of the 2-methylcitiric cycle in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Horswill and Escalante-Semerena , 1997 , 1999 ) . 
The transcriptional expression of prpBCDE from the prpBCDE promoter ( PprpB ) is regulated by IHF , cAMP-CRP complex , PrpR ( a transcriptional regulator ) , and 2-methycitrate ( 2-MC ) ( Horswill et al. , 2001 ; Lee and Keasling , 2005 ; Lee et al. , 2005 ) . 
The 2-MC-activated PrpR binds to an enhancer-like element located at a distance 5 ′ to the P , contacts the σ54 prpBdependent RNA polymerase by means of DNA loop formation , and activates transcription of prpBCDE from PprpB . 
We have developed a propionate-regulated overexpression system ( Sal-monella-based pPro ) containing the S. enterica PprpB responsible for expression of the propionate catabolic genes ( prpBCDE ) and prpR encoding the positive regulator of this promoter in E. coli ( Lee and Keasling , 2006 ) . 
Here , we tested the Salmonella-based pPro system in Salmonella and constructed a new expression host , a Salmo-nella prpD knockout mutant , which has an increased induction rate and induced expression levels compared with the arabinose-regulated T7 expression system .

2.2. Plasmid and strain construction
All DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli DH10B using established protocols ( Sambrook and Russel , 2001 ) . 
Plasmid pET7-gfp was constructed by PCR-amplifying gfpuv using a 5 ′ primer containing the consensus ribosome binding site ( RBS ) sequence AAGAAGG that originated from the pET vector and by ligating the PCR products into the BglII/XhoI-digested pET31b . 
To construct pPro7 ( E ) - gfp , the small DN fragments of pPro7 ( S ) - gfp resulting from digestion with NheI / SalI were ligated into the NheI/SalI-digested pPro18 ( Lee and Keasling , 2005 , 2006 ) . 
Mutation in prpB or prpD in S. enterica TR6583 strain was constructed by a PCR-medicated gene disruption method ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
The kanamycin resistance gene was then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase . 
The mutants were verified by PCR and designated TRB and TRD , respectively ( Table 1 ) .

2.3. Determination of in vivo promoter activities
Promoter activities were tested by using GFP for an indirect , quantitative measurement of the transcriptional properties of cloned gfp ( DeLisa et al. , 1999 ; Zhang et al. , 1998 ) . 
Overnight grown cells in LB medium at 37 °C were subcultured ( 1:100 ) into fresh LB medium ( 5 ml in culture tube and 20 ml in shake flask ) containing ampicillin ( 100 μg / ml ) , grown at 37 °C in a shaking incubator until the OD600 reached about 0.5 , and then induced at 37 °C with inducers in 96-well plates with shaking in a Tecan SpectraFluor Plus plate reader ( Tecan-US , Durham , N.C. ) or in a shaking incubator . 
The GFP fluorescence and OD600 were measured in the Tecan SpectraFluor Plus plate reader and expressed as relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) . 
RFU is defined as the culture fluorescence relative to the culture biomass at OD600 and plotted against induction time . 
3. Results
3.1 . 
Comparison of GFP production by the E. coli - and S. enterica-based pPro and T7 expression systems 
The gene encoding GFP was used to compare the expression kinetics from the pPro and T7 systems in S. enterica and E. coli . 
As was the case using E. coli as the host ( Lee and Keasling , 2006 ) , the S. enterica-based pPro system showed higher induced expression than the E. coli-based pPro system when using S. enterica as the host ( Fig. 1B and C ) . 
Both pPro systems had a long delay before gfp expression was fully induced in S. enterica . 
This may be due to consumption of the inducer by the enzymatic conversion of 2-MC to other metabolites via the 2-methylcitric cycle . 
In contrast , the T7 expression system exhibited a faster induction rate and higher fully induced expression than the pPro systems ( Fig. 1 ) . 
However , the T7 expression system showed much higher un-induced gfp expression than the pPro expression systems and a decrease in GFP production after about 10 h of induction ( Fig. 1A ) . 
3.2 . 
Comparison of GFP production by the S. enterica-based pPro in S. enterica mutants and the T7 expression systems 
To remove the time delay before high expression and to increase the induced expression level of the S. enterica-based pPro system in S. enterica , prpB − and prpD − mutant strains were constructed . 
As expected , S. enterica TRB ( prpB − ) and TRD ( prpD − ) showed faster induction rates and higher induced expression levels than the wild-type S. enterica TR6583 in shake flasks , probably due to the accumulation of 2-MC in these mutant strains ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) . 
In the shake flask experiment ( Fig. 2 ) , the background expression in TRD was slightly higher than that obtained in the wild-type strain , while TRB showed much higher background expression , similar to that of the induced cells . 
This result was unexpected since more 2-MC should have accumulated in TRD than in TRB . 
Compared to the T7 expression system , TRD harboring pPro7 ( S ) - gfp exhibited about 1.5 and 4-fold higher induced gfp expression at the 4 and 6 h time points , respectively , than SB300A # 1 harboring the PT7-gfp plasmid . 
Interestingly , the Salmonella T7 system showed decreased induced gfp expression after 4 h of induction , while the S. enterica-based pPro system exhibited increasing GFP expression levels throughout induction period ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In general , the Salmonella T7 system showed less background expression in the shake flask experiments ( Fig. 2A ) than in the 96-well plates ( Fig. 1A ) and culture tubes ( data not shown ) . 
Indeed , un-induced expression was similar to induced expression after 6 h , indicating that the arabinose-inducible T7 expression system is not controllable in SB300A # 1 ( Fig. 2A ) . 
With the exception of the prpB − mutant , which showed some background expression , both expression systems showed almost no un-induced gfp expression in the presence of glucose due to the catabolite repressed PprpB and PBAD promoters ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The Salmonella pPro system could be regulatable using va-rious concentrations of propionate throughout the induction period in TRD , while production of GFP from wild-type S. enterica TR6583 did not depend on the propionate concentration added to culture medium ( Fig. 3A and C ) . 
However , dose-dependent GFP expression was observed in the wild-type strain at the 6 - and 8-h time points . 
We speculated that this could be because of utilization of propionate and its derivatives as a carbon source by the PrpBCDE enzymes after around 4 h that causes increased cell mass at higher propionate concentrations ( Fig. 3A and B ) .

3.3. Propionate inhibition of growth in S. enterica
It has been reported that the intermediate of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle , 2-MC , or a derivative of it , is an inhibitor of cell growth ( Hammelman et al. , 1996 ; Horswill and Escalante-Semerena , 1999 ; Horswill et al. , 2001 ) . 
Consistent with previous results , the growth of the prpD − mutant was strongly inhibited when the medium was supplemented with high concentrations of propionate ( data not shown ) . 
In the presence of 20 mM propionate , the wild-type strain showed increased growth rate , while both prpB − and prpD − mutants exhibited slight growth inhibition ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) . 
However , no significant difference in growth rate was observed between wild-type and mutant cultures in the absence of propionate . 
It may be because the wild-type strain , unlike both mutants , can use propionate as a carbon source via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle . 
Interestingly , strain SB300A # 1 carrying pET7-gfp showed a sort of diauxic growth in the presence of arabinose ( Fig. 2A ) . 
4. Discussion
We developed a propionate-inducible overexpression vector for E. coli comprising the prpBCDE promoter and prpR , which encodes the 2-MC-activated regulatory protein ( PrpR ) of S. enterica . 
The vector allows simple control of heterologous gene expression using the inexpensive inducer propionate and exhibits low background and high induced expression in E. coli ( Lee and Keasling , 2006 ) . 
In this work , we tested the expression system in S. enterica and improved the expression system by using a prpD − mutant . 
This new strain showed lower background expression in the absence of glucose and higher and faster induced expression at induction conditions compared to the Salmonella T7 expression system . 
In the presence of glucose , both expression systems had very low background expression . 
Previous studies ( Hammelman et al. , 1996 ; Horswill et al. , 2001 ) demonstrated that S. enterica showed increased sensitivity to propionate when the 2-methylcitric acid cycle was blocked . 
Specifically , the prpD − mutant accumulated 2-methyl-citrate and grew poorly when the medium was supplemented with propionate , indicating that 2-MC or a derivative of it inhibits cells growth . 
Also , it has been reported that the lack of PrpB activity resulted in the accumulation of 2-MC and 2-methyl-cis-aconitate in S. enterica ( Horswill and Escalante-Semerena , 1999 ) . 
Consistent with previous results , the growth of TRB and TRD was inhibited in cultures supplemented with concentrations of propionate above 30 mM . 
Similar results were observed in E. coli BL21 prpB − and prpD − mutants , and as expected , the prpD − mutant in both E. coli and S. enterica showed more serious growth inhibition than the prpB − mutant in E. coli and S. enterica ( data not shown ) . 
In particular , E. coli BL21 prpD − showed higher growth inhibition than TRD in the presence of propionate . 
It might be related to the fact that propionate is a good substrate for S. enterica but not for E. coli ( Blank et al. , 2002 ) ; we do not understand the cause of the significant growth inhibition in the E. coli prpD mutant . 
In contrast , the presence of propionate in the medium positively affected the cell growth of the wild-type strain , probably due to utilization of propionate as a carbon source via the 2-methyl-citric acid cycle , unlike prpB − and prpD − mutants ( Figs. 2B and 3B ) . 
From these results , the Salmonella pPro system should is useful for tight regulation and high-level expression of foreign genes in wild-type or prpD − mutant S. enterica using approximately 20 mM propionate as an inducer . 
It has been reported that propionate can result from β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids ( Reitzer and Schneider , 2001 ) and that propionyl-CoA can be produced from several metabolic pathways ( Palacios et al. , 2003 ) . 
Thus , the inducer , 2-MC , can be produced from these two pathways . 
In terms of background expression , the prpD − mutant displayed low background expression similar to that of the wild-type strain in both Tecan and culture tube experiments ( data not shown ) . 
However , the prpB − mutant showed much higher uninduced expression in the absence of propionate than wild-type and prpD − mutant strains at all culture conditions tested . 
These results were unexpected , because the inducer , 2-MC , can be further metabolized into 2-methyl-cis-aconitate in the prpB − mutant . 
Our findings could indicate that background expression might not only be related to the amount of accumulated 2-MC , and that something produced from 2-MC may regulate prpBCDE expression positively .

This experiment was performed using the same culture method as described in Fig. 2 . 
Symbols indicate propionate concentrations added into culture medium . 
Error bars show the standard deviation of experiments performed in triplicate 
To our surprise , we found that the growth curve of SB300A # 1 cultures growing on LB containing arabinose was diauxic . 
Presumably , this pattern seems to be related to the decrease of GFP production after 4 h of induction , indicating that arabinose is metabolized preferentially during growth . 
Like the E. coli T7 expression system ( Lee and Keasling , 2006 ) , the S. enterica arabinose-inducible T7 system showed significantly reduced background expression in the shake flask experiments , compared to the Tecan and culture tube experiments . 
The high level of oxygen transfer rates of shake flask might change metabolic reactions within the microorganisms , which may differentially affect expression from PBAD and PT7 . 
Although more experimental data are necessary to understand the precise mechanism of how prpBCDE expression is controlled differently in the prpB − and prpD − mutants , this work demonstrated a propionate-inducible overexpression system in S. enterica prpD − mutant with low basal expression in the presence of glucose and high regulatable expression . 
Finally , since propionate is 1/30th of the cost of arabinose , the use of propionate for gene expression induction in large bioreactors can be significant .
