Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is one of the leading causes of food-borne diseases in Japan . 
Typically , Salmonella spp . 
test positive for lysine-decarboxylase . 
However , the number of isolates of serovar Enteritidis without lysine-decar-boxylase activity increased in Japan in 2003 . 
Among 109 strains from distinct outbreaks , 10 lacked lysine-decarboxylase activity . 
Nine of the ten lysine-decar-boxylase-negative strains showed quite similar pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis proﬁles . 
Their lysine-decarboxylase phenotype was recovered by introduction of the cadBA locus from an lysine-decarboxylase-positive strain . 
Although the cad loci of the lysine-decarboxylase-negative strains seemed to be intact without any insertion sequences , cadC , a positive regulator of cadBA , had a single-base deletion at the same position , the 973rd base ( cytosine ) , in all the nine lysine-decarbox-ylase-negative strains , whereas the wild-type cadC gene has a 1542 bp coding region ( 514 amino acids ) . 
This deletion was expected to produce a truncated ( 338 amino acids ) form of CadC due to a frameshift . 
Because CadC senses environmental cues such as external pH and lysine through its putative C-terminal periplasmic domain , it is likely that the truncated CadC is not sensitive enough to external signaling to activate the cadBA operon , resulting in loss of the lysine-decarboxylase activity . 
Our results suggest that dissemination of these genetically closely related strains of serovar Enteritidis accounts for the unusual increase in the isolation of lysine-decarboxylase-negative strains .

Introduction
Nontyphoidal salmonellae are the predominant causative agents of food-borne diseases in Japan . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis has been predominant since 1989 ( National Institute of Infectious Diseases , 2003 ) . 
Biochemical testing of amino acid decarboxylase activities is the most popular means of identifying Enterobacteriaceae . 
A test for lysine decarboxylase ( LDC ) is used for the identiﬁcation of Salmonella spp . 
as typical nontyphoidal salmonellae are positive for LDC ( Farmer , 2003 ) . 
The mechanism of LDC activity has been studied in Escherichia coli and is considered to depend on the cad locus . 
The cad locus consists of three genes , cadC , cadB and cadA . 
cadA and cadB encode lysine decarboxylase and lysine-cadaverine antitransporter , respectively , and constitute the cadBA operon . 
The cadBA operon is expressed under conditions of low external pH in the presence of lysine . 
cadC is located upstream of cadBA and encodes a positive regulator for the expression of cadBA through sensing signals induced by external pH and lysine ( Tabor et al. , 1980 ; Meng & Bennett , 1992a , b ; Watson et al. , 1992 ; Neely & Olson , 1996 ; Soksawatmaekhin et al. , 2004 ) . 
The deduced amino acid sequence of CadC has three domains : a cytoplasmic domain at the amino terminus , a transmembrane domain , and a periplasmic domain at the carboxyl terminus . 
The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is similar to DNA-binding domains of bacterial response regulators belonging to the ROII subclass ( Parkinson & Kofoid , 1992 ; Dell et al. , 1994 ) . 
In 2003 , there was an unusual increase in the frequency of identiﬁcation of LDC-negative isolates of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in Japan . 
The present study examined LDC-negative isolates by bacteriophage typing and genotyping , and also analyzed the cad loci to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenotype in Salmonella spp . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
A total of 802 isolates related to 109 apparently independent outbreaks that occurred in 2003 were collected from local public health institutes . 
Of these , 109 strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis representative of these outbreaks were used in this study . 
Phenotypic and genotypic characterization
The LDC test was performed using Moller Lysine medium ( Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) ( Moller , 1955 ) . 
Bacteriophage typing was performed according to the method of the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) ( London , UK ) ( Ward et al. , 1987 ) . 
Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) was performed as previously described using the S. enterica serovar Braender-up H9812 as a standard strain ( Ribot et al. , 2002 ; Hunter et al. , 2005 ) , with the following modiﬁcations . 
The DNA in agarose plugs was digested with BlnI ( Takara Bio Inc. , Shiga , 
Japan ) . 
Digested DNA was separated through a 1 % SeaKem Gold agarose gel ( Cambrex Bio Science Rockland Inc. , Rockland , ME ) in 0.5 TBE buffer at 14 1C in a CHEF DR-III ( Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. , Hercules , CA ) with the following electrophoresis conditions : initial switch time of 1 2.2 s , ﬁnal switch time of 63.8 s , 6 V cm , at an angle of 1201 for 19 h . 
The resulting proﬁles were scanned and saved in the TIFF format to be analyzed using FINGERPRINTING II software ( Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. ) . 
Similarity was determined using the Dice coefficient , and clustering was based on the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages ( UPGMA ) with a band position tolerance of 1.2 % .

Analyses of the cad locus
LDC 
PCR of the cad locus was performed with Takara Ex Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara Bio Inc. ) using chromosomal DNA of LDC-negative strains as a template . 
cadC and cadBA were ampliﬁed using primer pairs of 50-GCCGGATCCCCT GCTTATTGCGCTGC-30 and 50-GCCAAGCTTAATCTTCT GCCAGAAAAC-30 , and 50-GCCGGATCCGTTTTCTGGCA GAAGATTAA-30 and 50-GCCAAGCTTATTTCGTATTTTC TTTCAGC-30 , respectively . 
The ampliﬁed fragment of cadC was puriﬁed using Sigma Spin Post-Reaction Puriﬁcation Columns ( Sigma-Aldrich

Complementation of the cad genes
To construct cad expression plasmids , wild-type cadC and cadBA were cloned into pUC18 and pUC19 vectors digested

with BamHI and HindIII ( Takara Bio Inc. ) after performing PCR as described above using chromosomal DNA of an LDC-positive strain , E-1219 , as a template . 
The resulting plasmids ( pUC18-cadC , pUC19-cadC , pUC18-cadBA , and pUC19-cadBA ) were introduced into LDC-negative strains by electroporation for the assay of complementation . 
Results and discussion
Typing of outbreak-related strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 
A total of 109 strains of serovar Enteritidis were subjected to bacteriophage typing and LDC testing . 
The results are summarized in Table 1 . 
Ten ( 9.2 % ) strains were LDC-negative , with ﬁve identiﬁed as phage type ( PT ) 4 , four as PT14b , and one as PT1 . 
As shown in Table 1 , PT4 , PT47 and PT1 strains were predominant in 2003 as well as in previous years ( Izumiya et al. , 2003 ) . 
PT14b strains were also not uncommon . 
However , strains testing negative for LDC are considered unusual among Salmonella spp . 
PFGE genotyping showed unique PFGE proﬁles of LDC-negative PT4 and 
PT14b strains of serovar Enteritidis ( Fig. 1 ) , but these proﬁles were quite similar to each other . 
The proﬁle of the LDC-negative PT1 strain differed , however , with less than 50 % similarity to the other strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Thus , these PT4 and PT14b strains were probably responsible for the unusual increase in the frequency of the LDC-negative strains . 
We therefore analyzed their cad locus further .

LDC negativity of the PT4 and PT14b strains of serovar Enteritidis due to a mutation in cadC
The LDC phenotype has been shown to depend on the cad locus in Escherichia coli . 
Inactivation of cadC by an insertion sequence has been reported to also cause LDC negativity in E. coli ( Casalino et al. , 2003 ) . 
PCR was used to detect the cadBA operon and the cadC gene of the LDC-negative strains . 
The results showed that bands with the expected sizes were ampliﬁed in each one ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that there were no apparent genetic changes due to insertion sequences . 
We then cloned the cadBA operon and the cadC gene of an LDC-positive strain of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in the pUC18 and pUC19 vectors for use in complementation assays of LDC negativity . 
The resulting plasmids were named pUC18-cadBA , pUC18-cadC , pUC19-cadBA and pUC19-cadC , respectively . 
The cloned cadBA operon and the cadC gene contained the putative authentic promoters . 
It was expected that expression of the genes cloned in pUC18 would be constitutive and dependent upon the lac promoter in the vector as well as on the genes ' own promoters , whereas the genes cloned in pUC19 were expected to be expressed under the control of only their own promoters . 
Two LDC-negative strains were used for complementation experiments : one representative of PT4 strains ( E-1211 ) and the other representative of PT14b strains ( E-1217 ) . 
The LDC phenotype of both strains was restored following transformation with pUC18-cadBA , pUC18-cadC and pUC19-cadC . 
However , the introduction of pUC19-cadBA did not restore the LDC phenotype ( Table 2 ) . 
These results suggest that ( 1 ) the LDC phenotype depended on expression of the cadBA operon in S. enterica as well as in E. coli , and ( 2 ) the activity of the positive regulator CadC was insufﬁcient for the activation of the cadBA promoter in the LDC-negative strains , as pUC19-cadBA could not restore the phenotype , whereas pUC19-cadC could . 
The nucleotide sequences of the coding regions for the CadC proteins and their 0.1 kb upstream regions were determined . 
Both the PT4 and PT14b LDC-negative strains exhibited a single-base deletion at position 973 ( cytosine ) of the 1542 bp coding region ( 514 aa ) , which was predicted to result in a truncated CadC ( 338 aa ) on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The sequences of cadC of all the other LDC-negative strains of PT4 and PT14b were examined , and the same deletion mutation found , which is consistent with the similarity in their PFGE proﬁles .

Numbering starts at the putative initiation codon . 
A frameshift mutation due to the deletion of the cytosine at position 973 ( shown in bold uppercase ) was expected to lead to truncation of the deduced 
CadC protein ( 514 aa ) to 338 aa . 
The hatched box indicates the position of the putative DNA-binding domain . 
The solid box indicates the position of the transmembrane domain . 
This mutation causes a frame shift in the cadC gene to produce a truncated form of CadC . 
The truncated CadC protein retained its putative DNA-binding and transmembrane domains , but lacked its C-terminal domain . 
Single amino acid substitutions in the carboxyl terminal periplasmic domain cause derepression of pH - and lysine signaling , suggesting that this domain is important for the function of CadC as a sensor ( Dell et al. , 1994 ) . 
The truncation identiﬁed in this study seemed to be a novel type of mutation in that it was not due to any insertion sequences and would cause loss of the ability of CadC to sense such external signals . 
However , the truncation might not cause complete loss of function because multicopy expression of the truncated CadC by a pUC18-based plasmid restored the phenotype of the LDC-negative PT4 and PT14b strains ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , the mutation identiﬁed in this study is likely to reduce the ability of CadC to activate cadBA transcription due to a weak response to signals induced by external pH or lysine . 
Analysis of the LDC-negative PT1strain of serovar Enteritidis
Casalino M , Latella MC , Prosseda G & Colonna B ( 2003 ) CadC is the preferential target of a convergent evolution driving enteroinvasive Escherichia coli toward a lysine decarboxylase-defective phenotype . 
Infect Immun 71 : 
PCR , complementation assay and sequence analysis of cadC were carried out to examine the cad locus in the LDC-negative PT1 strain E-0548 as well as the LDC-negative PT4 and PT14b strains . 
The PCR results revealed no apparent genetic changes ( data not shown ) . 
The LDC negativity of the PT1 strain was suppressed by overexpression of cadBA from pUC18-cadBA . 
However , neither pUC18-cadC nor pUC19-cadC could restore the phenotype ( Table 2 ) . 
In addition , no mutations were found in cadC of the LDC-negative PT1 strain . 
These results indicate that the PT1 strain has mutation ( s ) in gene ( s ) which differ from those found in the LDC-negative PT4 and PT14b strains . 
Further investigations are needed to elucidate the mutation ( s ) responsible for the phenotypes .

Concluding remarks
An LDC-positive phenotype is a major characteristic of Salmonella spp. , and is widely used in simpliﬁed screening tests ( Wilson , 2004 ) . 
However , there was an unusual increase in the frequency of LDC-negative strains isolated in local public health institutes in Japan in 2003 , accounting for no less than 9 % of outbreak-related strains . 
Almost all of them showed similar PFGE proﬁles and had the same point mutation in cadC , though they included two phage types , PT4 and PT14b . 
It would appear that the dissemination of these genotypically related strains was responsible for the unusual increase in the LDC-negative isolates . 
We identiﬁed a novel point mutation in cadC which was acquired naturally and might affect the function of the CadC protein as a sensor . 
Such a mutation would cause unusual biochemical characteristics such as LDC negativity in Sal-monella spp . 
Conversely , unusual characteristics may reﬂect genetic changes , as described in this paper . 
Such unusual features would be useful as epidemiological markers along with other typing methods such as PFGE and bacteriophage typing .
