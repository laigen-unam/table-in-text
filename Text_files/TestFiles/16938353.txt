Abstract 
Intestinal epithelial cells represent the ﬁrst line of defence against pathogenic bacteria in the lumen of the gut . 
Besides acting as a physical barrier , epithelial cells orchestrate the immune response through the production of several innate immune mediator molecules including b-defensins . 
Here , we establish the porcine intestinal cell line IPI-2I as a new model system to test the regulation of porcine b-defensins 1 and 2 . 
Gene expression of both defensins was highly upregulated by foetal calf serum components in normal growth medium . 
In serum-free medium , baseline expression remained low , but pBD-2 gene expression was increased 10-fold upon infection with Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Arcobacter cryaerophilus and Salmonella Enteritidis , pathogenic bacteria with comparable adhesion and invasion characteristics , failed to increase pBD-2 mRNA levels . 
Heat killed or colistintreated Salmonella Typhimurium had no effect , showing that the upregulation of pBD-2 was dependent on the viability of the Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Gene expression of pBD-1 was regulated differently since an increase in pBD-1 mRNA was observed by Salmonella Enteritidis infection . 
We conclude that the IPI-2I cells can serve as a new model to study porcine b-defensin regulation and that pBD-1 and pBD-2 are differentially regulated in this cell line .

1. Introduction
Innate immunity is the ﬁrst line of host defence against invading pathogens . 
Part of the innate immune response is the secretion of antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) . 
Hundreds of AMPs have already been described in vertebrates , invertebrates , plants and fungi ( http : / / www.bbcm.units.it / tossi/pag1 . 
htm ) . 
Besides the classical bactericidal role of AMPs , several additional roles in innate immunity have recently been assigned to AMPs . 
These include chemotactic activities for immature dendritic cells , memory T cells and monocytes ( Territo et al. , 1989 ; Yang et al. , 2000 ) , stimulation of angiogenesis ( Conejo-Garcia et al. , 2004 ; Li et al. , 2000 ) , and mast cell activation to induce chemotaxis , histamine release and prostaglandin production ( Niyonsaba et al. , 2001 , 2002 ) . 
Thus , besides being effector molecules of innate immunity , AMPs also provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity . 
Defensins comprise a major subclass of the family of AMPs . 
Based on the spatial distribution of their six cysteine residues and the connectivity of the disulﬁde bonds , defensins can be classiﬁed into a - , b - and u-defensins ( reviewed in Lehrer , 2004 ; Selsted an

Ouellette , 2005 ) . 
The a-defensins are most prominent in neutrophils and Paneth cells , the secretory cells in the Lieberkühn crypts of the intestine . 
Main expression sites of b-defensins are the epithelial cells of skin and of various mucous membranes in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract and other organs exposed to the external environment . 
Functional u-defensins have only been detected in PMN and bone marrow in monkey , but a pseudo u-defensin gene has been found in humans as well ( Cole et al. , 2002 ) . 
In pig , neither a nor u-defensins have been described , and only one b-defensin , porcine b-defensin 1 ( pBD-1 ) , has been studied up to date on a protein level ( Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
This b-defensin was found primarily in tongue mucosa but low mRNA levels were also found in other epithelial tissues including the intestine . 
Recently , several potentially new porcine bdefensins were described , based on sequence homology with existing b-defensins ( Sang et al. , 2006 ) . 
Some of these new defensins seem to be expressed in the intestine as part of a more general broad expression pattern , but based on these gene expression patterns no speciﬁc intestinal defensin has been characterised . 
No data on structure or biological activity has been described to date for any of these new defensins . 
Intestinal epithelial cells play an important role in the innate immune response against pathogenic bacteria present in the lumen of the gut . 
Besides acting as a physical barrier against pathogens , recent studies suggest that epithelial cells also play a key role in production of several cytokines , chemokines and other signalling molecules ( Pitman and Blumberg , 2000 ) . 
In addition , they can produce antibacterial agents such as complement components , lysozyme , secretory phospholipase A and defensins ( Andoh et al. , 1993 ; Bernet-Camard et al. , 1996 ; Ouellette , 1997 ) . 
Many of these studies have been performed using intestinal epithelial cell lines , which offer obvious advantages over animal infection studies . 
However , the use of porcine intestinal epithelial cell lines has been very limited until now , which has considerably hampered the studies on the porcine immune response upon bacterial infections . 
Three intestinal epithelial cell lines have been described of which only one , IPEC-J2 , has been used in a few studies on bacterial pathogenesis ( McOrist et al. , 1995 ; Schierack et al. , 2006 ; Skjolaas et al. , 2006 ; Sonntag et al. , 2005 ) . 
The aim of this study is to establish the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPI-2I ( Kaeffer et al. , 1993 ) as a model system for research on regulation of expression of porcine defensins and to detect the effect of pathogenic bacteria on porcine defensin production . 
First , the baseline expression of these defensin transcripts is described in two different growth media . 
Next , we show that viable Salmonella Typhimurium induces pBD-2 production . 
Salmonella Enteritidis upregulates pBD-1 after 6 h whereas another invasive pathogen , Arcobacter cryaerophilus does not have any effect on pBD regulation . 
We show that IPI-2I cells offer a valuable model to test regulation of defensin gene expression and that pBD-1 and pBD-2 are differentially regulated in these cells . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Overnight cultures of A. cryaerophilus LMG 7537 , Salmonella serotype Enteritidis strain 90-13-706 ( Van Asten et al. , 2000 ) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 ( Hendriksen et al. , 2004 ) , were prepared freshly for every experiment by cultivation from a frozen stock at 37 8C in Luria Bertani broth ( LB ) . 
Before use in adhesion , invasion and infection experiments , an overnight culture was subcultured 1:100 and incubated for 2 h ( both Salmonellae ) or 24 h ( A. cryaerophilus ) at 37 8C . 
Bacteria were then collected in the exponential phase , spun down and resuspended in IPI-2I cell culture medium at approximately 1 10 CFU/ml .

2.2. Cell culture
The IPI-2I cell line ( ECACC 93100622 ) was established from the ileum of an adult boar ( d/d haplotype ) and immortalized by transfection with an SV40 plasmid ( pSV3-neo ) ( Kaeffer et al. , 1993 ) . 
IPI-2I cells were maintained in two different media : ( 1 ) Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) ( Flow Laboratories , Amstelstad BV , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) supplemented with 1 % ( v/v ) non-essential amino acids , 50 mg/ml gentamycin , 10 mM NaHCO3 , 1.7 mM glutamine , 0.024 U/ml Insulin , 25 mM HEPES , and 10 % ( v/v ) FCS ; ( 2 ) UltraCulture serum-free medium ( Cambrex , Verviers , Belgium ) , supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamycin , 1.7 mM glutamine . 
IPI-2I cells were seeded into 12-well tissue-culture plates ( 4 cm / well ) , with 2 5 10 cells/cm and grown at 37 4 2 8C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO2 and 95 % air . 
In all experiments IPI-2I cells were used between passages 30 and 50 . 
2.3. Sucrase isomaltase activity assay
The release of glucose from saccharose which is catalysed by the epithelial brush-border enzyme sucras isomaltase activity was determined according to Dahlqvist ( 1970 ) . 
In short , IPI-2I cells were collected and added to 25 ml 50 mM saccharose in 0.1 M maleate buffer pH 6.0 . 
The sample was incubated at 37 8C for 6 h after which 250 ml TGO reagent ( 0.5 M Tris pH 7.0 , 130 mg/l o-dianiside , 0.2 % Triton X-100 , 5 mg/l peroxidase ) was added and the sample was incubated at 60 8C for 1 h . 
The optical density at 405 nm was determined and compared to standard glucose samples . 
2.4. Adhesion and invasion experiments
IPI-2I cells were grown to conﬂuency ( 5 days ) in 12-well tissue-culture plate and incubated with 1 ml of 1 10 CFU/ml bacteria for 1 h . 
The monolayers were 8 washed three times with plain media ( DMEM or UltraCulture ) and lysed in 1 % Triton-X100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min in order to release the bacteria . 
The suspensions were serially diluted 10-fold and 100 ml of each dilution was plated on LB agar . 
The plates were incubated for 24 ( Salmonellae ) or 48 h ( A. cryaerophilus ) at 37 8C under microaerophilic conditions . 
Numbers of cell-associated bacteria were calculated as total ( adhering and intracellular ) bacterial CFUs . 
In the invasion assay , the IPI-2I monolayers in the wells were washed once with 1 ml warm plain medium ( either DMEM or UltraCulture ) after 1 h incubation with bacteria and then incubated for 2 h with 1 ml of 300 mg/ml colistin in warm plain DMEM to kill extracellular bacteria . 
Cells were washed three times with plain DMEM , and ﬁnally lysed in 1 % Triton X-100 . 
The number of intracellular bacteria was determined by colony plating as described above . 
2.5. Infection of intestinal cells with bacteria
IPI-2I cells were grown to conﬂuency in UltraCulture medium as described above and infected with 1 ml of 1 10 CFU/ml bacteria for 3 h . 
After 8 incubation , cells were washed twice and incubated with fresh warm UltraCulture medium containing 300 mg/ml colistin . 
Medium was taken for IL-8 detection and IPI-2I cells were collected for quantitative PCR analysis by 6 , 12 and 24 h post-infection . 
2.6. Effect of viability of bacteria on defensin gene expression
S. Typhimurium were grown to log phase and collected as described above . 
The bacteria were then killed by ( 1 ) incubation in UltraCulture medium at 80 8C for 60 min , or ( 2 ) incubation in UltraCulture medium containing 1 mg/ml colistin . 
Subsequently , the medium containing the bacteria was used in the IPI-2I infection experiments . 
In addition , the treated bacteria were serially diluted and colony plated on TSA to detect surviving S. Typhimurium ( treated samples ) or growth of bacteria in the incubation period ( control samples ) . 
2.7. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
IPI-2I cells were seeded on plastic slides in 12-well tissue-culture plates . 
After the cells reached conﬂuency , cells were incubated with the various bacterial strains for 1 h . 
The cells were then washed three times with plain DMEM and incubated with Karnovsky 's glutar-aldehyde ﬁxative for more than a week . 
Subsequently , the following ﬁxation , wash and rehydration steps were performed : washing with 0.1 ml of cacodylate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) ; post-ﬁxation with 2 % OsO4 in 0.1 ml cacodylate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) for 2 h. Rinsing in 0.1 M cacodylate for 10 min and additionally six times in distilled water for 30 min ; incubation in 2 % tannine for 1 h ; washing six times 1 h in distilled water ; ﬁxation in 2 % OsO4 buffered in 0.1 M cacodylaat buffer pH 7.4 for 1 h ; dehydration using serial solutions of 50 % , 70 % , 80 % , 96 % , and 100 % acetone , and critical-point-dried using a Bal-Tec CPD 030 system . 
Finally , the samples were coated with platinum to a thickness of about 10 nm and examined using a Philips XL 30 SFEG scanning electron microscope . 
2.8. RNA isolation
Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell cultures using a solution of guanidine thiocyanate and phenol ( TRIzol , Invitrogen life technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , 1 as recommended by the suppliers . 
An extra wash step with ice cold 70 % ethanol was performed to remove the ﬁnal traces of organic solvents . 
Purity and quality of the RNA extracts was checked on 1 % agarose gels and using UV absorption at 260/280 nm . 
2.9. ELISA
The IL-8 secretion of IPI-2I cells was determined in the medium using the human IL-8 Cytosets antibody TM pair kit containing matched , pretitered , and fully optimised capture and detection antibodies , recombinant standard and streptavidin -- horseradish peroxidase ( Cat . 
no . 
CHC1304 ) ( Biosourse Europe SA , Nivelles , Belgium ) . 
The assay was performed following the manufacturer 's instructions 
Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed on DNAse-treated ( Invitrogen ) total RNA samples . 
Por-cine b-defensins 1 and 2 , and hypoxanthine -- guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) gene transcripts were analysed using the following primers and probes : HPRTfor : tggaaagaatgtcttgattgttgaag ( 100 nM ) ; HPRTrev : atctttggattatgctgcttgacc ( 100 nM ) ; HPRTpro : acactggcaaaacaatgcaaacctgct ( 200 nM ) ; pBD-1for : tgccacaggtgccgatct ( 100 nM ) ; pBD-1rev : ctgttagctgcttaaggaataaaggc ( 100 nM ) ; pBD-1pro : tttggagcaca-cttgcccggcata ( 800 nM ) ; pBD-2for : ccagaggtccgaccactaca ( 300 nM ) ; pBD-2rev : ggtcccttcaatcctgttgaa ( 300 nM ) ; pBD-2pro : ctgcaacttctccccctgcccg ( 200 nM ) . 
Probes were labelled with 50-FAM ( pBD-1 and HPRT ) or 50-Yakima Yellow ( pBD-2 ) and 30-Deep Dark Quencher 1 ( all probes ) . 
All qPCR reactions were performed using a one-step qPCR technology ( Eurogentec , Luik , Belgium ) , utilizing 0.1 ng RNA per reaction in 25 ml on a ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems , Weiterstadt , Germany ) , using the following cycling protocol : 30 min 48 8C ( RT step ) ; 10 min 95 8C ( denaturation ) ; 42 cycles : 15 s at 95 8C , 60 s 60 8C . 
Relative gene expression to the housekeeping gene HPRT was performed in order to correct for the variance in amounts of RNA input in the reactions .

For experiments with multiple treatment groups , average data were analysed by the non-parametric Kruskal -- Wallis test . 
Experiments with two treatment groups were analysed using an unpaired Students ' t-test for normal-distributed data or the Mann -- Whitney test for data with a non-normal distribution . 
Signiﬁcant differences were deﬁned as p < 0.05 .

We ﬁrst assessed the adhesion and invasion of the invasive porcine pathogen S. Typhimurium using the IPI-2I cell line . 
In these experiments adhesion of 20 bacteria per IPI-2I cell was observed whereas invasion of S. Typhimurium was 17 per 1000 IPI-2I cells . 
Adhesion of S. Typhimurium to the IPI-2I cells was also qualitatively conﬁrmed using scanning electron microscopy ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In addition , the IL-8 production of IPI-2I cells upon S. Typhimurium infection was determined , which is shown in Fig. 2 . 
Compared to the control cells , a signiﬁcant increase in IL-8 production was observed upon infection after 4 and 6 h. However , a substantial increase in IL-8 was seen in control cells as well after prolonged incubation , which indicates that under our culturing conditions , cells are stressed to some extend

Quantitative PCR 
Evaluation of quantitative real-time PCR revealed reliable and consistent ampliﬁcation of the target genes pBD1 , pBD2 and HPRT . 
Dilution experiments of RNA aliquots ( 160 pg to 10 ng ) resulted in a very similar ampliﬁcation efﬁciency of the genes with gradients ranging from 3.1 to 3.4 ( R > 0.95 ) Thus , results 2 were normalized against HPRT by calculating the difference in Ct ( DCt ) . 
3.3. Baseline defensin gene expression of IPI-2I cells
The production of pBD-1 and pBD-2 mRNA of IPI-2I cells was assessed in DMEM ( +10 % FCS ) from 2 to 7 days to determine the baseline production of these gene transcripts . 
The values , shown in Fig. 3A and B shows that a 1000-fold increase in production of pBD-2 and a 15-fold increase in pBD1 is observed over 4 days ( days 2 -- 6 ) . 
Production of pBDs after reaching conﬂuency ( day 5 ) remained high but showed variable values . 
To test whether the FCS present in the growth medium caused the observed effect on defensin production , serum-free UltraCulture medium was used for IPI-2I growth in the next set of experiments . 
Fig. 3C and D shows that under these serum-free growth conditions the defensin mRNA production changed dramatically . 
At day 6 , pBD-1 mRNA levels had dropped 15-fold compared to IPI-2I cells grown in serum containing medium while pBD-2 levels were even 700-fold lower . 
In addition , the defensin mRNA levels remained relatively constant for the ﬁrst 6 days although some variation is observed for pBD-1 mRNA levels with a minimum expression at day 5 . 
However , these different expression levels did not reach statistical signiﬁcance due to the relatively high variation between separate experiments . 
Fig. 4 shows that addition of 10 % FCS to UltraCulture medium led to a similar gene expression increase as observed for DMEM med-ium + 10 % FCS , indicating that the observed effect could be attributed to FCS and is not caused by a constituent of the DMEM medium itself . 
The change of growth medium had no observable effect on morphology growth rate , IL-8 production and susceptibility towards invasion and adhesion of pathogenic bacteria ( results not shown ) . 
Therefore , the serum-free conditions were used for the bacterial infection experiments . 
3.4. Bacterial infection of IPI-2I cells
The effect of bacterial infection on defensin gene expression was tested by infecting IPI-2I cells in UltraCulture medium with three invasive pathogens , A. cryaerophilus , S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis . 
Samples were isolated after 6 and 24 h , and for the two Salmonella species also after 12 h. No effect was observed on the IPI-2I cell count upon infection ( 500,000 cells/cm ) . 
The results are depicted in Fig. 5 2 and show that all bacteria have a different effect on defensin production . 
After 6 h S. Enteritidis has increased the pBD-1 gene expression 10-fold compared to the control sample after 6 h . 
After 12 h this effect is largely diminished . 
The increase in pBD-1 gene expression at 24 h is likely due to the baseline increase also seen in the control , non-infected cells and does not reﬂect an extra effect of S. Enteritidis . 
A. cryaerophilus and S. Typhimurium had no signiﬁcant effect on pBD-1 production although a tendency to higher pBD-1 gene expression ( p = 0.17 ) is observed for the latter after 24 h ( Fig. 5A ) . 
Interestingly , the control group showed a three-fold increase as well over 24 h which corresponds to the effect seen in Fig. 2C ( the increase in pBD-1 mRNA from days 5 -- 6 ) . 
For pBD-2 gene expression , different results were observed . 
No upregulation was seen for A. cryaerophilus and S. Enteritidis while S. Typhimurium infection resulted in a 10-fold increase compared to non-infected IPI-2I cells after 24 h. To test whether the increase in pBD-2 expression was dependent on the viability of S. Typhimurium , bacteria were either killed by heat inactivation ( 60 min , 80 8C ) or colistin ( 60 min , 1 mg/ml ) . 
Colony plating of the treated bacterial solutions revealed that no viable bacteria could be detected after the treatment for bot methods . 
pBD-2 mRNA expression was assessed and showed a clear dependency on viability of S. Typhimurium . 
A signiﬁcant increase in pBD-2 mRNA level compared to the control cells was observed after 12 and 24 h for viable S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 6B ) , whereas heat-killed or colistin-killed S. Typhimurium had no , or a much smaller effect . 
The effect of viability of S. Typhimurium on pBD1 expression is shown in Fig. 6A . 
This time the viable S. Typhimurium had a more pronounced effect after 24 h compared to the last set of experiments ( Fig. 5A ) . 
This effect was also dependent on viability of S. Typhimurium since no increase was observed for the heat-killed or colistin-killed bacteria .

4. Discussion
In the present study we used the porcine ileal epithelial cell line IPI-2I as a new model system to detect the effect of bacterial infection on expression of pBD-1 and pBD-2 . 
In porcine intestinal research , only very few research groups have used intestinal epithelial cell lines for immune studies contrary to human research where it is a widely used tool . 
The IPI-2I cell line used in this study has not been extensively characterised . 
It is described as containing a relatively low number of microvilli , which is also clear from Fig. 1 , and being poorly differentiated due to the lack of villin expression ( Kaeffer et al. , 1993 ) . 
In addition , we tested the brush-border enzyme sucrase isomaltase as an indicator for differentiation , but no increase in sucrase isomaltase activity was observed in the ﬁrst 14 days of growth ( results not shown ) . 
However , IPI-2I cells did resemble epithelial cells of the intestine with respect to several other characteristics . 
Adhesion and invasion of pathogenic bacteria was observed , and IL-8 production by IPI-2I cells was increased upon infection . 
The production of the chemoattractant IL-8 by intestinal cells is considered to promote inﬂammation after bacterial infection in vivo ( McCormick et al. , 1993 ) . 
Most importantly , pBD-1 and pBD-2 mRNA was detected in these epithelial IPI-2I cells derived from the ileum , which is similar to the in vivo situation where both defensins have been detected in this intestinal segment as well ( Veldhuizen et al. , 2007 ) . 
In addition , based on the semi-quantitative analysis of the newly discovered putative b-defensins , pBD2 is the defensin expressed highest in the ileum ( Sang et al. , 2006 ) , indicating the potential role for this defensin in intestinal health . 
A relatively strong IL-8 production was detected for non-infected IPI-2I cells , indicating that under normal growth conditions these cells are somewhat stressed . 
This property of IPI-2I cells may affect production of innate immune effector molecules such as defensins . 
However , in our experimental set-up , IL-8 production was not affected by FCS while there was a strong effect of FCS on the baseline defensin gene expression . 
This indicates that IL-8 production by IPI-2I cells is not the direct cause of the gene expression of pBD-1 and pBD-2 . 
Upon optimalisation of the model system to study defensin regulation , a strong baseline increase in gene expression of both defensins was observed in IPI-2I cells in DMEM medium . 
Apparently , one or more serum components of the growth medium stimulated expression of defensins , since serum-free UltraCulture medium showed a less variable baseline expression increase in the ﬁrst 6 days after seeding ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This is not the ﬁrst report where nutrients instead of bacterial or pro-inﬂammatory agents induce defensin production . 
Induction of bovine epithelial b-defensin by L-isoleucine ha been described ( Fehlbaum et al. , 2000 ) and a similar increase of human defensin 1 mRNA expression by BSA and amino acids was recently reported in human colon cells ( Sherman et al. , 2005 ) . 
These ﬁndings could be particularly interesting with respect to the search for natural compounds that can boost innate immunity without causing an inﬂammatory reaction in the tissue . 
An explanation for the observed increase in pBD gene expression is that the presence of serum proteins is sensed by epithelial cells indicating tissue damage , to which they respond by inducing a general defence response . 
It would be interesting to determine the signalling pathways by which this immune response is triggered and whether it is different from the pathways leading to defensin expression upon bacterial infections . 
The IPI-2I cell model may be a useful tool to investigate this matter . 
The use of UltraCulture medium resulted in a constant low expression of pBD-2 during the ﬁrst 6 days of culture ( Fig. 3 ) , whereas gene expression of pBD-1 was low but more variable during the ﬁrst 6 days . 
Apparently , small day-to-day variations could , to some extend , affect pBD-1 expression . 
Another reason for the variance in pBD-1 levels is probably the low level of pBD-1 expression in our experimental set-up . 
A constant baseline expression of defensins was required for testing the effect of bacterial infections on defensin gene expression . 
However , the removal of FCS from the growth medium resulted in constant pBD-1 levels that are close to the limit of detection where a linear dose -- response ( pBD-1 mRNA concentration versus Ct value ) is achieved . 
This could have added to deviations in the detected level of PBD1 mRNA . 
For pBD-2 the linear dose-response extends to much higher Ct values ( lower concentration pBD-2 mRNA ) than pBD-1 , which means that lower mRNA concentrations can be reliably measured and compared to samples with higher mRNA levels . 
The observed deviations of pBD-1 mRNA detection indicates that IPI-2I cells are more reliable as a model for detecting changes in pBD-2 mRNA levels than pBD-1 mRNA under these experimental conditions . 
Infection for 3 h with three bacterial strains in our IPI-2I cell model showed that S. Typhimurium induced expression of pBD-2 while A. cryaerophilus or S. Enteritidis did not cause such an effect . 
Adhesion and invasive characteristics towards IPI-2I cells are similar for all three strains , which could not explain the observed difference . 
Viability of S. Typhimurium was essential for the observed effect ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Results for pBD-1 were less clear . 
Both S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium seemed to have an upregulating effect ( after 6 and 24 h , respectively ) , but the extent of induction was quite variable for

Inset shows the Box and Whiskers plot of the same data . 
S. Typhimurium ( compare Fig. 5A and 6A ) . 
Part of the difference might be explained by different pBD-1 expression behaviour of the non-infected cells in separate experiments to which the infected cells are compared . 
We chose to express the defensin mRNA levels relative to one sample ( control 6 h ) . 
The more often used relative expression index ( REI : 1/4 2 DDCt ) depicts pBD mRNA T levels of the infected cells relative to control cells of the same post-infection time ( where a REI of 1 indicates no difference in gene expression compared to the control ) . 
However , using this alternative method the variance of pBD expression in the control samples over time is not shown , which is an essential part in evaluating whether IPI-2I cells can serve as a good model system for studying defensin regulation . 
The observed induction of pBD-1 is consistent with a report by Sang et al. who used IPEC-J2 cells to study pBD-1 regulation ( Sang et al. , 2005 ) . 
They showed that both Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes infection caused an upregulation of pBD-1 , 6 h post-infection . 
No report on pBD-2 mRNA production of the IPEC-J2 cells was described . 
Until recently , pBD-1 was considered a constitutively expressed protein . 
This was mainly based on studies with tongue epithelial cells where bacterial infections , but also well-known pro-inﬂammatory mediators such as LPS , TNF-a and IL-1b failed to induce pBD-1 expression ( Liu et al. , 2001 ; Zhang et al. , 1999 ) . 
These results indicate that upregulation of defensins could be tissue or cell type speciﬁc . 
For pBD-1 it could mean that constitutively high levels of pBD are produced at places where it is thought to play a surveillance role such as the tongue , while in other tissues it is only induced upon a bacterial trigger . 
Especially in the intestine constitutively high levels of antimicrobial peptides are unwanted because they could be harmful for the commensal intestinal microbiotica ( Finlay and Hancock , 2004 ) . 
In summary , we used the intestinal epithelial cell line IPI-2I to study regulation of pBD-1 and pBD-2 gene expressions . 
Incubation of S. Typhimurium caused a clear upregulation of pBD-2 mRNA whereas S. Enteritidis and A. cryaerophilus had no effect on pBD-2 expression . 
pBD-1 mRNA levels increased 6 h after S. Enteritidis infection and 24 h after S. Typhimurium infection . 
These results indicate that both defensins are differentially regulated . 
In addition , we show that IPI-2I cells provide a useful new tool to study regulation of pBD-1 and pBD-2 in vitro .
