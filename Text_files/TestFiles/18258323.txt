Abstract 
A new commercial system based on genetic profiling and aimed at identifying Salmonella enterica serovars was evaluated by comparing its performance with classical serotyping on 443 strains . 
Within 62 serovars represented , 60 gave unique genetic profiles while 2 were undistinguishable . 
Results were obtained within 8 h , were reproducible and clear-cut . 
The system allowed single-tube processing of the samples and required no peculiar technical skill . 
It showed interesting potential for routine laboratory testing .

1. Introduction
Nontyphoidal salmonellae are a leading cause of reportable foodborne infection in industrialized countries . 
This bacterium typically causes intestinal infections accompanied by fever , abdominal cramps and diarrhea with symptoms lasting over 1 week ( Hohmann , 2001 ) . 
Wild and domestic animals act as reservoirs and transmission to humans occurs generally through consumption of contaminated food . 
Therefore , monitoring of the food chain by means of large surveillance programs has been implemented in many countries . 
Salmonella enterica isolates can be discriminated on the basis of O ( surface polysaccharide ) and H ( flagellar ) antigenic properties , the latest being expressed in two separate phases . 
Currently , more than 150 different O and H antigens are used for the characterization of over 2500 Salmonella serovars ( Bopp et al. , 2003 ; Perch et al. , 
2003 ) . 
At least three antibody-antigen reactions are required to indentify a particular Salmonella serovar while uncommon serovars usually require further tests to be correctly identified . 
The scoring of antigenic formulae uses the Kaufmann -- White scheme which is annually updated by the World Health Organization ( Bopp et al. , 2003 ; Popoff et al. , 2004 ) . 
Serotyping has clear deficiencies inherent to the analysis time and to the limited applicability of the methodology . 
It often takes 3 or more days to generate a result and only 92 to 95 % of the isolates can be fully serotyped . 
Typing failure is caused by the lack of surface O antigens exposure in certain mucoid and `` rough '' strains ( Bopp et al. , 2003 ) , while just partial typing can be performed in nonmotile isolates ( no expression of flagella ) . 
For such strains , additional biochemical is required . 
Phage sensitivity tests can be used to further discriminate strains with identical serotypes . 
Further problems with serotyping are due to ( i ) prolonged subculturing that can affect the antigenic properties of the strain , ( ii ) the technical expertise required , ( iii ) the costs issuing from specific antisera production and validation . 
All together , thes difficulties hinder the response to an outbreak and/or its epidemiologic surveillance . 
Over the last 20 years , alternative strategies aimed at replacing or complementing traditional serotyping methods have been proposed . 
These include PCR / real-time PCR specific identification and typing methods ( Esteban et al. , 1993 ; Hoorfar et al. , 2000 ; Jensen Hubner , 1996 ; Nair et al. , 2002 ; Shangkuan Lin , 1998 ; Torpdahl Ahrens , 2004 ; Uzzau et al. , 1999 ) , multiplex PCR ( Alvarez et al. , 2004 ; Kim et al. , 2006 ) , DNA sequencing ( Mortimer et al. , 2004 ) , and DNA microarrays ( Chan et al. , 2003 ; Porwollik et al. , 2004 ) . 
Protein-based approaches have been developed as well ( Cai et al. , 2005 ; Wilkes et al. , 2005 ) . 
The problems associated with these strategies include reproducibility of the results obtained in different laboratories , requirement of specialized equipment , high cost per sample analysis and highly trained staff . 
In this work , we evaluated the efficiency of the Premi ® Test Salmonella ,1 a new commercial DNA-based test aimed at identifying common serovars of S. enterica ( Andreoli et al. , 2004 ) . 
A total of 443 Salmonella strains belonging to 62 different serovars were tested in parallel using both Premi ® Test and classical serotyping methods . 
In addition , 43 non-Salmonella strains were tested to assess the specificity of the system .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Principle of the method
The Premi ® Test Salmonella system uses a methodology called multiplex ligation detection reaction ( LDR ) to generate a collection of circular DNA molecules that are subsequently PCR amplified by means of a single pair of amplimers ( Schouten et al. , 2002 ; van Eijk et al. , 2004 ) . 
The PCR products are next sorted by hybridization to a low-density DNA microarray . 
Positive hybridization is detected using a biotin label incorporated in one of the PCR primer ( Fig. 1 ) . 
A set of genetic markers has been selected with the purpose of yielding unique microarray hybridization profiles to identify and discriminate S. enterica serovars ( Andreoli et al. , 2004 ; Baner et al. , 2003 ) . 
The test allows single-tube processing , which simplifies the technical work associated with strain typing 
Fig. 1 . 
Principle of the Premi ® Test Salmonella typing system . 
( A ) When properly hybridized to a target sequence , the nick lying between two adjacent LDR probe arms is ligated , so that a single circular fragment is generated . 
( B ) Critical mismatches in the target sequence will cause ligation to fail , leaving the probe ends apart . 
( C ) Successful ligation products are amplified by PCR using a single pair of amplimers annealing to complementary sequences included in the LDR probes ( white boxes ) . 
( D ) Unique ZIP codes ( hashed box ) assigned to each LDR probe will be specifically captured by complementary oligonucleotides ( cZIP codes , reverse-hashed box ) spotted on the microarray . 
( E ) Detection occurs thanks to a biotin label incorporated at the 5 ′ - end of one of the PCR primer . 
The system can be multiplexed with many different LDR probes , each bearing a unique ZIP code ( black-filled boxes ) . 
The successive reactions are processed in a single tube .

The Premi ® Test Salmonella is a trademark of DSM Nutritional Products . 
The microarray setup is depicted in Table 1 . 
It includes a number of controls assessing the success of each critical step in the procedure including ligation specificity and efficiency , PCR amplification , hybridization efficiency , label detection and label quality . 
Moreover , the use of Salmonella general LDR probes ensures that the investigated strain indeed belongs to the expected species . 
Serovar identification relies on a series of 14 LDR probes targeting DNA markers whose sequence vary within the different Salmonella serovars . 
Each LDR probe carries a ZIP code that is complementary to a unique oligonucleotide ( cZIP ) immobilized on the microarray . 
The detailed DNA sequences of the LDR probes were not released by the manufacturer . 
Their selection was based on nucleotide sequence comparisons performed at 30 random genomic loci on twenty S. enterica subsp . 
enterica strains , each belonging to one of the following serovars : Agona , Anatum , Bovismorbificans , Braenderup , Brandenburg , Dublin , Enteritidis , Goldcoast , Hadar , Heidelberg , Infantis , Livingstone , München , Newport , Oranienburg , Panama , Saint-Paul , Typhimurium , Typhimurium DT104 , Virchow . 
For each locus , 400 to 600 bp of sequence information was generated in all 20 serovars and multiple alignments were carried out to identify SNPs . 
Each SNP was assessed for three criteria , namely ( i ) an allele frequency between 30 and 70 % , ( ii ) the absence of additional SNPs adjacent to the investigated SNP , ( iii ) a GC % in the range of 40 -- 60 % up and downstream from the SNP locus . 
2.3. Microarray reading
Microarray results were read on a single-channel ATR03 reader consisting basically in a CCD-based transmission detector ( Clondiag , Jena , Germany ) . 
The reader was connected to a standard computer and the data were processed by a customized software supplied by the manufacturer ( Check ¬ 
Points , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) . 
The software automatically translated the Salmonella microarray data into a serovar name .

2.4. Premi®Test Salmonella procedure
Reagents and procedures were supplied in a kit provided by the manufacturer Check-Points ( Wageningen , The Netherlands ) . 
Briefly , 10 μl of a 0.1 ng μl − 1 solution of genomic DNA purified on a dedicated mini-column ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) was added to 8 μl of a freshly prepared proprietary mix containing ligation probes and thermostable DNA ligase . 
Alternatively , 10 μl of a crude bacterial extract ( approximately 2 × 106 CFU μl − 1 ) obtained by boiling a water suspension for 10 min , was used as template material . 
The sample was heated in a MyCycler PCR instrument ( Biorad , La Jolla , CA ) during 3 min at 95 °C followed by 24 cycles of 0.5 min at 95 °C and 5 min at 65 °C followed by a final denaturation at 98 °C for 2 min . 
Next , 15 μl of a second proprietary exonuclease mix was added . 
The sample was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and subsequently for 10 min at 95 °C to remove non-ligated LDR probes . 
Next , 15 μl of a third proprietary mix containing PCR primers , deoxynucleoside triphosphates and thermostable polymerase was added . 
The sample was heated during 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 0.5 min at 95 °C , 0.5 min at 55 °C , 1 min at 72 °C , and a final denaturation step of 2 min at 98 °C . 
The amplified ligation products ( final volume 48 μl ) were then subjected to DNA hybridization in a customized 1.5-ml ArrayTube ® ( Clondiag , Jena , Germany ) containing a 2 × 2 mm microarray spotted with 100 DNA cZIP-code oligo-nucleotides complementary to a set of unique sequences included in the LDR probes . 
Hybridization was performed using 10 μl of each amplified reaction supplemented with 300 μl of pre-heated hybridization buffer and lasted for 30 min at 50 °C under rotational shaking ( 400 rpm ) in a thermo-mixer ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) . 
Thanks to the use of 3 independent probe sets , each ArrayTube ® could detect 3 independent amplification reactions at once . 
Unbound DNA was washed away using two 5-min incubation steps with 300 μl blocking buffer in the same conditions . 
Biotin label detection was then performed with 150 μl of freshly prepared 0.125 μg ml − 1 poly-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin ( Endogen , Rockford , IL ) incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and shaken at 400 rpm . 
Excess conjugate was washed away by two 5-min incubation steps using 300 μl detection buffer in the same conditions . 
Finally , the detection reaction was initiated at room temperature by replacing the last washing solution by 150 μl of ready made TrueBlue ™ peroxidase substrate ( KPL , Gaithersburg , MD ) . 
DNA hybridization results were measured after 15 min on the reader .

2.5. PCR primers and ligation probes
The PCR primers had the following raw sequences : 5 ′ - Biotin-GTAGACTGCGTACCAATTC-3 ′ ( primer Eco ) and 5 ′ - GAC-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAA-3 ′ ( primer Mse ) . 
The ligation probes had the following generic sequence : P-5 ′ - TSL-TTACTCAG-GACTCATCGTC - ( N ) x-GTAGACTGCGTACCAATTC-ZIP - TSR-3 ′ - OH where TSL and TSR are target-specific left and right arms , respectively . 
Underlined nucleotides are the PCR priming sites . 
ZIP defines 20 -- 25 nucleotide-long sequences matching complementary capture probes ( cZIPs ) on the microarray . 
2.6. DNA strains
Salmonella and non-Salmonella strains are listed in the Supplementary material ( Tables S3 and S4 , respectively ) . 
3. Results and discussion
The system was evaluated on a number of strains of both human and animal origin isolated mostly between 1997 and 2005 in Belgium and The Netherlands in course of routine laboratory typing . 
The typing results are summarized in Table 2 . 
The combination of positive and negative hybridization reactions resulted in a 14-digit binary code matching a particular Salmonella serovar ( Andreoli et al. , 2004 ) . 
For better convenience , this code was converted into a unique identifier calculated with the following formula X14 2x 1 1/4 k x 1 where x is the spot number considered and k a multiplication factor equals to 1 for positive hybridizations or 0 for negative hybridizations . 
For instance , when applied to serovar Braenderup , the Premi ® Test Salmonella gives the 14-digit code 01010101100000 converted into the unique identifier 426 with the above formula . 
Typical microarray results are shown in Fig. 2 . 
The use of 3 independent sets of identical LDR probes differing only by their ZIP codes allowed for the simultaneous typing of 3 strains per microarray ( Fig. 2 , Panels I to III ) . 
In total , 443 Sal-monella and 43 non-Salmonella strains were tested . 
Both common and less common serovars were each represented as far as possibl with several strains of different origin . 
Serovars associated with broiler chickens and regarded as important for human health , were the most represented . 
These included S. enterica sv . 
Enteritidis ( 35 strains ) , Hadar ( 15 strains ) , Infantis ( 17 strains ) , Typhimurium ( 33 strains ) and Virchow ( 11 strains ) . 
Each strain was typed in parallel by slide agglutination using the classical serotyping scheme with antisera purchased from the Statens Serum Institute ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) and from BioRad ( La Jolla , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
When required , additional biochemical tests were conducted to complete the identification . 
Phage typing ( Ward et al. , 1987 ) was performed on 17 out of the 35 strains of S. enterica sv . 
Enteritidis and 13 different phage types were found . 
Of the 443 Salmonella strains tested with the Premi ® Test Salmonella , 84 unique profiles were identified compared to the 62 serovars found by classical serotyping . 
This means that some serovars were characterized by more than a single microarray pattern , which is a good indication of the system 's sensitivity . 
Another critical sensitivity issue of the Premi ® Test system was addressed by testing strains belonging to the closely related serovars Enteritidis , Gallinarum and Dublin ( Porwollik et al. , 2005 ) . 
The results show that all these strains matched 4 distinct genetic identifiers , 2 of these being associated with serovar Enteritidis . 
In a more general way , clustering of Salmonella strains into discrete genetic profiles matched remarkably the serovar assignment , knowing that both typing methods rely on totally different markers . 
This observation is reminiscent to the one observed by authors working on totally different genetic markers ( Sukhnanand et al. , 2005 ) and argue in favor of a parallel evolution of the global genome diversity on one hand and of the variability of surface antigens on the other . 
The multiple microarray patterns observed within a single serovar were sometimes very similar , differing at a single spot only ( sv . 
Brandenburg , Infantis , Lexington , Liverpool , Manhattan , Poona ) . 
Other serovars were much more heterogeneous ( sv . 
Livingstone , Newport , Oranienburg , Schwarzengrund ) . 
The detailed strain typing data are provided as Supplementary material ( Tables S3 and S4 ) .

Identifiers associated with 2 different serovars . 
In conclusion , the microarray system assessed here was found robust and globally sensitive . 
As few as 105 CFU or genome equivalents were used routinely for strain typing . 
It gave satisfactory results on most crude Salmonella extracts in the absence of DNA purification . 
The analysis time ( 8 h ) was relatively short compared to the barely predictable time scale of classical typing . 
The single-tube processing of the samples was found particularly convenient compared to other multiplexed analysis systems . 
The reading of the microarray results required a very simple device hosted in a standard molecular biology laboratory and required no peculiar technical expertise . 
The system could differentiate 2 or 3 genotype variants in 19 out of the 62 serovars tested , indicating superior discriminating capacity compared to serotyping . 
At the other hand , its current design did not allow to differentiate sv . 
Münster from sv . 
Sandiego . 
Complementary serotyping tests are thus required to finalize the identification of strains belonging to these peculiar serovars . 
Given this limitation , it can be anticipated that other instances of Sal-monella serovars with overlapping Premi ® Test identifiers may be found if much more serovars are analyzed . 
The open design of the LDR method on one hand and of the ZIP-code microarray on the other , renders the system easily improvable to reach the sensitivity level required for the typing of hundreds of different serovars . 
Future releases of the Premi ® Test Salmonella should therefore include additional genetic markers to increase the discriminating power of the test . 
In addition , extensive strain testing will be required to strongly validate the system before it can be envisioned as a trustable alternative to classical serotyping . 
The current system sensitivity , however , is sufficient for the preliminary identification and typing of S. enterica subsp . 
enterica by first-line laboratories as well as laboratories in charge of sanitary controls in breeding farms and food industries . 
Assessment of the Premi ® Test Salmo-nella on DNA directly extracted from food samples following enrichment procedures should be also investigated in the future .

Typical DNA microarray pictures obtained with the ArrayTube ® 100-spot setup . 
This format uses a DNA microarray fixed at the bottom of a micro-reaction vial . 
The microarray consists in unique complementary ( cZIP ) oligonucleotides targeting individual LDR probes . 
When hybridization of the PCR-amplified ligation products to the microarray is complete , colorimetric detection of the positive reactions is initiated . 
Polygons delineate panels in the array . 
Each panel defines the typing results of one strain and consists in control spots and specific marker spots ( listed in Table 1 ) . 
The strains typed in this figure belong to serovar Enteritidis ( Panel I ) , Hadar ( Panel II ) and Infantis ( Panel III ) .
