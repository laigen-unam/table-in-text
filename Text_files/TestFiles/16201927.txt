INTRODUCTION
ABSTRACT 
Between 2000 and 2002 , 60 clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis were collected to investigate the mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance . 
PCR and sequencing were performed to identify mutations in gyrA , gyrB , parC , the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump regulator , acrR , and the global regulons marRAB and soxRS . 
All resistant strains showed mutations in the target genes leading to amino acid changes of Ser83Phe and Asp87Asn in GyrA and Ser80Ile in ParC . 
A mutation in gyrB was linked to the serotype genetic diversity but not to fluoroquinolone resistance . 
An efflux pump inhibitor , Phe-Arg - - naphthylamide , caused fourfold lower MIC of ciprofloxacin in the resistant isolates , indicating that efflux systems are involved in fluoroquinolone resistance . 
Western blot analysis showed moderate overproduction of AcrA in fluoro-quinolone-resistant isolates . 
A mutation in acrR gave rise to an internal stop codon in both ciprofloxacin-re-sistant and - susceptible isolates , suggesting another serotype genetic diversity . 
No mutations were detected in marRAB and soxRS among the isolates examined . 
Cross-resistance to three fluoroquinolones was observed , but gatifloxacin demonstrated relatively lower MICs than those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin . 
Fluoroquinolone resistance in S. Choleraesuis appears to be the combination effect of multiple mutations in various target genes and overexpression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump . 
NONTYPHOID SALMONELLA INFECTION remains an important public health problem throughout the world .10,20,21 Among more than 2,500 serotypes of nontyphoid Salmonella , Salmo-nella enterica serotype Choleraesuis shows a high predilection for causing systemic infections in humans ,7,10 and therefore antimicrobial therapy is essential in the treatment of such infections . 
Appropriate drugs may include ampicillin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxale , and chloramphenicol ; however , the increasing rates of resistance to these traditional agents have made treatment of invasive salmonellosis a clinical dilemma .20,21 Of particular concern is the recent emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. Choleraesuis , because this class of antimicrobial agents constitutes the drug of choice for treating potentially life-threatening Salmonella infections caused by mul-tidrug-resistant strains .7 In Salmonella , quinolone resistance has first been attributed to point mutations in the gyrA gene coding for the A subunit of gyrase , whose complex with DNA is the primary target of quinolones . 
Resistance mutations of gyrA cluster in a region of the gene product between amino acids 67 and 106 , termed the quinolone resistance-determining region ( QRDR ) . 
Amino acid changes at codon 83 ( Ser to Phe , Tyr , or Ala ) or at codon 87 ( Asp to Gly , Asn , or Tyr ) are the most frequently observed in nalidixic acid-resistant strains .9 Double mutations at both residues 83 and 87 have been identified in clinical isolates of a S. Typhimurium phage type DT204 clone showing high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones .2,3,12 The amino acid substitutions ( Ser83Phe and Asp87Asn ) was identical in several isolates , and these isolates had , in addition , an altered gyrB gene coding for the B subunit of gyrase : a single mutation in the QRDR of gyrB leading to an amino acid change Ser464Phe .2,3,12,13 Most recently , these isolates have been shown to carry a fourth mutation in the QRDR of parC coding for the ParC subunit of topo-isomerase IV , which is the secondary target for quinolones . 
The mutation identified led to the amino acid change of Ser80Ile .2,3,12 Fluoroquinolone resistance in S. Typhimurium has also been attributed to active efflux mechanisms , and in particular to the participation of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system .2,3 Inactivation of the genes coding for either the AcrB inner membrane multidrug transporter or the TolC outer membrane channel in S. Typhimurium DT204 strains resulted in a 16 - to 32-fold reduction of resistance level to several fluoroquinolones .2,3 The same effect was obtained using the recently identified efflux pump inhibitor , Phe-Arg - - naphthylamide ( PA N ) .3 Thus , high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. Typhimurium DT204 was essentially explained by the combination of two major resistance mechanisms , i.e. , multiple target gene mutations and active efflux mediated by AcrAB-TolC .2,3 Recent reports suggest fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Choleraesuis has emerged and is widespread in Taiwan .7,8 In this study , we analyzed mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance , including target gene mutations and efflux pumping , in S. Choleraesuis with MICs of ciprofloxacin at 8 -- 32 g/ml isolated from patients in Taiwan .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial isolates
Sixty clinical nonrepetitive isolates of S. Choleraesuis collected from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Children 's Hospital between 2000 and 2002 were examined in this study . 
These isolates were identified according to standard methods ,11 and the serotype was confirmed by the slide agglutination test with the use of O antisera ( Becton Dickinson and Co. , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and by the tube agglutination test with the use of H antiserum ( Becton Dickinson and Co. , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The MICs of ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin , and gatifloxacin against the isolates were determined by the E-test ( AB Biodisk ) using the method proposed by the manufacturer . 
Susceptible , intermediate , or resistant isolates were defined according to the criteria recommended by the National Committee for Clinical 16 Laboratory Standards ( NCCLS ) . 
The MIC breakpoints for fluoroquinolones are : for gatifloxacin and levofloxacin , susceptible , 2 g/ml , intermediate , 3 -- 6 g/ml , and resistant 8 g/ml ; and for ciprofloxacon , susceptible , 1 g/ml , intermediate , 2 -- 3 g/ml , and resistant , 4 g/ml . 
Amplification and sequencing of the QRDRs of gyrA , gyrB , parC , acrR , and efflux pump regulator , and marRAB , soxRS global regulatory genes , and We have completely sequenced the genes of gyrA , gyrB , parC , parE , acrR , marRAB , and soxRS of a fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Choleraesuis strain , SC-B67 , and found mutations in the QRDRs of gyrA , gyrB , and parC6 and a stop mutation in acrR , but no mutation was found in parE , marRAB , and soxRS ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , the QRDRs of gyrA , gyrB , and parC and the mutation region of acrR were amplified and sequenced in some clinical isolates of S. Choleraesuis . 
The sequences of these primers were 5 - GTA CTT TAC GCC ATG AAC GT and 5 - TAC CGT CAT AGT TAT CCA CGA for gyrA ; 5 - ACT CCT CCA GTA TCA AAG TCC T and 5 - CGT GCT CGT AAA TCT GAC GGT for gyrB ; 5 - GCC TAC TTA AAC TAC TCC and 5 - AGT CGG ATA ATC CGG CCC for parC ; 5 - ACG ACA CAA CAC ATC CTG GAT T and 5-AAA GGC TAC GTT GCG CCT GT for acrR ; 5 - ACG GTG GTT AGC GGA TTG GC and 5 - AGC GGC GGA CTT GTC ATA GC for marRAB ; and 5 - CGA ACA GGG CGT CGT CGC TT and 5 - CTG GTT GCT AAA ACC CGG CG for soxRS . 
These primers were used in the amplification procedure as described earlier .7 PCR products were purified with the use of Wizard PCR Preps kit ( Promega ) and then sequenced with an automatic sequencer ( ABI 3730 , Perkin-Elmer , Applied Biosystems ) . 
The sequences obtained were analyzed for their nucleotide and amino acid homology with the GenBank data-base by using the FASTA software . 
AcrA expression analysis by Western blot hybridization
The involvement of efflux-mediated resistance via the AcrAB-TolC efflux system was determined by measuring AcrA production using Western blot hybridization as described previously .3 Overnight culture was centrifuged and resuspended at an A600 value of 10.0 . 
The suspension was further diluted threefold by adding sample buffer and lysed at 100 °C for 10 min . 
Total proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 0.8 mA/cm2 . 
The membrane was washed with Tris-buffer saline ( TBS ; 0.15 % NaCl , 10 mM Tris-HCl pH7 .5 ) three times and then blocked with TBS containing 1 % skim milk , incubated with an anti-AcrA polyclonal antibody diluted 1/2 ,000 in TBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 ( TBS-T ) and 0.33 % skim milk . 
After three washes in TBS-T , the membrane was incubated for 1 hr with peroxidase conjugated to Protein A ( Sigma ) diluted 1/1 ,000 in TBS-T . 
Finally , after three washes in TBS-T , the blot was developed using the solution of TBS containing 0.06 % 4-chloro-1-naphthol and 5 mM H2O2 . 
The reaction was stopped by washes in distilled water . 
In this experiment , S. Typhimurium strains BN18 , BN18/21 , BN18/41 , and BN18/713 and one ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolate of S. Choleraesuis SC-B42 were used for comparisons . 
Efflux inhibition assay
Efflux was also investigated by determining antibiotic susceptibilities in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor ( EPI ) , PA N ( Sigma ) , as described previously .3 MICs of ciprofloxacin were determined in the presence of the PA N at the concentration of 80 g/ml . 
S. Typhimurium strains BN18 , BN18/21 , BN18/41 , and BN18/713 and one ciprofloxacin-sus-ceptible isolate of S. Choleraesuis SC-B42 were also examined for the purpose of comparison . 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) was performed as follows . 
Bacterial colonies were suspended in 10 mM Tris and 0.1 mM EDTA solution and cast into a plug , which was then treated with ESP buffer ( 0.5 M EDTA , 1 % sodium lauroyl sarcosine , 0.5 mg of proteinase K/ml ) for 24 hr . 
The plug was washed , digested overnight with 40 units ( U ) of XbaI in NEB2 buffer at 37 °C , and loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel . 
PFGE was carried out with a CHEF Mapper XA System ( Bio-Rad Laboratories ) . 
The gel was run with a linear increase in switching times ( from 4 to 70 sec ) over a period of 26 hr , a 120-degree switch angle , and a gradient of 6.0 V per centimeter . 
The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with UV illumination . 
The DNA fingerprints generated by PFGE were 22 analyzed according to the criteria proposed by Tenover et al. . 
RESULTS
Susceptibility of S. Choleraesuis to fluoroquinolones The year of isolation and susceptibility of S. Choleraesuis to various fluoroquinolones are shown in Table 1 . 
Apparently , the resistance level to gatifloxacin was slightly lower than those to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin , both of which showed similar range of MIC , MIC50 , and MIC90 against S. Choleraesuis . 
Among the 36 isolates that expressed full resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin , 75 % ( 27 isolates ) were only intermediately resistant to gatifloxacin , with a MIC range of 3 -- 6 g/ml , MIC50 of 4 g/ml , and MIC90 of 4 g/ml . 
Mutations in QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, and parC and effflux pump regulatory gene, acrR
Of the 60 clinical isolates , the sequences of the QRDRs of gyrA and parC were analyzed . 
All strains that were resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin contained the same mutations in gyrA and parC that gave rise to amino acid changes of Ser83Phe and Asp87Asn in GyrA and Ser80Ile in ParC , regardless the susceptibility status to gatifloxacin ( Table 2 ) . 
The susceptible strains contained a single mutation in GyrA either at Asp87Gly ( 8/24 ) or at Asp87Asn ( 14/24 ) . 
Two other single mutations were found in ParC at Ser57Ile ( 1/24 ) and Ser57Thr ( 1/24 ) . 
In addition , a mutation was found at Thr72Met of GyrB ; however , this mutation appears not associated with fluoroquinolone resistance because all S. Choleraesuis tested , regardless of the resistance phenotypes , contained this point mutation . 
Of the 19 isolates sequenced for the acrR gene , only one revealed a normal coding sequence of acrR ; all other strains , susceptible or resistant , showed a mutation at codon 78 ( Gln to a termination codon ) , indicating that acrR in most S. Choleraesuis has already evolved to become a pseudogene ( Table 2 ) . 
In addition , no mutation was detected in the global regulatory genes , marRAB and soxRS , for three representative ciprofloxacin-resistant strains , SC-B67 , SC-B51 , and SC-B6 , and two susceptible strains , SC-B42 and SC-B43 . 
Role of AcrAB-TolC in resistance to fluoroquinolones
Evidence for active efflux was confirmed in representative strains of S. Choleraesuis and control strains of S. Typhimurium by Western blot hybridization with the anti-AcrA polyclonal antibody , which showed overproduction of the AcrA periplasmic protein in the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains , relative to the susceptible strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Quantification was done by densi-tometry using the Bio1D ( Vilber-Lourmat ) software . 
Strain BN18 was used as reference ( value 1 ) , and the values of overexpression levels of the other strains relative to strain BN18 were : S. Typhimurium BN18/21 , 5 ; S. Typhimurium BN18/41 , 13 ; S. Typhimurium BN18/71 , 18 ; S. Choleraesuis SC-B42 , 2 ; S. Choleraesuis SC-B43 , 9 ; S. Choleraesuis SC-B6 , 3 ; and S. Choleraesuis SC-B51 , 3 . 
The level of AcrA production correlated well with the level of resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. Choleraesuis , i.e. , strain SC-B43 showed a relatively higher level of production ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Active efflux was also confirmed by the inhibition assay : EPI ( PA N ) at the concentration of 80 g/ml significantly reduced the ciprofloxacin MIC levels approximately four-fold against the resistant isolates as well as the S. Typhimurium control strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
Genotyping
To identify strain types further , PFGE was performed and the DNA fingerprints obtained were analyzed using Tenover 's criteria .22 One major PFGE type ( type 1 ) was identified in 58 isolates . 
The other two isolates belonged to types 2 and 3 , respectively . 
Among the 58 type 1 isolates , 12 subtypes ( type 1a to type 1l ) could be further identified in 14 isolates , when a subtype is defined as having only three-band difference from the major type 1 . 
The result indicates that all these isolates were closely related in genetic clones . 
DISCUSSION
S. Choleraesuis is an infrequent serotype of Salmonella isolated from humans in the United States .5 However , this highly invasive serotype is of particular concern in Asian countries . 
S. Choleraesuis is the second most common serotype of Salmo-nella found in humans in Taiwan5 ; it is also common in Hong Kong and Thailand .1,5 The high rate of multidrug resistance is hampering the use of conventional antibiotics in the treatment of systemic infections caused by S. Choleraesuis ,5 and the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance is further aggravating the situation and thereby posing a threat to the public health of these countries .7 Generally , development of fluoroquinolone resistance in Sal-monella is a stepwise process . 
The first and most important step involves mutations of the target genes , including topoisomerase II genes ( gyrA and gyrB ) and topoisomerase IV genes ( parC and parE ) , both of which are responsible for DNA replication . 
In S. Typhimurium , reduced susceptibility or resistance to fluoroquinolones has been shown to be conferred by point mutations in gyrA , gyrB , and parC .2,3,12,13 In accordance with this , our results showed that all S. Choleraesuis strains resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin had the same double mutation in gyrA and single mutation in parC . 
Moreover , PFGE analysis revealed that these isolates were closely related in genetic clones . 
These indicate that the development and spread of such resistant strains in Taiwan might be a universal phenomenon due to clonal propagation . 
This study also confirmed that a mutation of gyrB at codon 72 was not associated with the resistance phenotype . 
This mutation may be the result of genetic divergence among the gyrB genes of S. Choleraesuis , S. Typhimurium , and E. coli , rather than being related to fluoroquinolone resistance . 
An interesting observation is the differential activity of various fluoroquinolones against S. Choleraesuis . 
Our results demonstrated that the MIC of gatifloxacin was slightly lower than those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin . 
Such dichotomous resistance appears not to be associated with the target gene mutations mentioned above . 
One possible explanation is the structural difference at C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus between ciprofloxacin ( C-8-H ) and gatifloxacin ( C-8-methoxy ) . 
It has been shown that both chemicals inhibited topoisomerase IV equally , while the inhibitory activity of gatifloxacin against DNA gyrase was about six-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin .4 Western blot analysis showed moderate to high-level production of AcrA in fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Choleraesuis , compared to the susceptible strain , SC-B42 . 
The use of the efflux pump inhibitor , PA N , decreased the ciprofloxacin resistance level by four-fold , suggesting the participation of efflux in fluoroquinolone resistance in S. Choleraesuis . 
The combination of PA N and fluoroquinolone was the most effective in decreasing the resistance levels as was previously shown for fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium DT204 strains .3 Expression of acrAB , encoding the major AcrAB efflux pump , is subject to multiple levels of regulation . 
In E. coli it is modulated at the lowest level by the local repressor AcrR .14 At a more global level , acrAB expression is modulated by stress conditions and by global regulatory genes , such as marA , soxS , and rob .14,17,18 The acrAB locus is indeed part of the mar , sox , and rob regulons of E. coli , the activation of which confers a low-level resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents and organic solvents .17 Previous studies clearly showed that overexpression of marA , which results from marR mutations , would down-regulate the expression of acrR , thus inducing high-level AcrAB expression and antimicrobial resistance .23 Proteins encoded by the mar locus include the transcriptional activator , MarA , its local repressor , MarR , and MarB and MarC , two proteins with unknown functions . 
MarR negatively regulates the expression of marRAB by binding to the marO operator region .17 On the other hand , proteins encoded by the soxRS locus include the transcriptional activator , SoxS , and another protein , SoxR , the oxidized form of which can activate soxS expression . 
In this study , no mutation was detected in the global regulons marRAB and soxS for the strains studied . 
There was a mutation in acrR that gave rise to an internal stop codon ; however , such mutation was found in both ciprofloxacin-resistant and susceptible strains . 
Thus , it is likely linked to the serotype genetic diversity , rather than to fluoroquinolone resistance . 
All of the transcriptional activators act independently of the others . 
In S. Choleraesuis , there are probably mutations at other regulator loci than mar and sox that skip from acrR to control the expression of acrAB , in response to the action of fluoroquinolones . 
In Klebsiella pneumoniae , a marA homologue , ramA , was found overexpressed in fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates .19 RamA overexpression ( but not MarA or SoxS overexpression ) was related to increased AcrAB efflux pump expression in the collection of K. pneumoniae isolates .19 Upstream of ramA in the genome of S. Typhimurium LT2 , there is a gene in opposite orientation similar to tetR that could be the local repressor gene of ramA .15 Further studies to evaluate regulatory mechanisms of AcrAB expression other than mar , sox , and acrR in S. Choleraesuis should be undertaken .
