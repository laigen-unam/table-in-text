Abstract rpoS mutant . 
These effects were nulliﬁed in RAW 264 cells treated with an NOS inhibitor and in iNOS-deﬁcient primary macrophages . 
Peroxynitrite susceptibility assays of these strains were also performed . 
The rpoS mutant Typhi strain was more sensitive to in vitro peroxynitrite treatment than was the parent strain . 
Together these data show that NO has a signiﬁcant host defense function during serovar Typhi infection , and that Salmonella RpoS , because it reacts to the presence of NO or its reactive derivatives , is thought to have a role in the pathogenicity of serovar Typhi .

The involvement of nitric oxide ( NO ) in host defense and cytoprotective functions in murine salmonellosis has been reported . 
Salmonella mutants with the altered sigma factor RpoS ( s ) are less virulent and are susceptible to various stresses . 
This study investigated the role of the rpoS S gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in NO-dependent host defense in vitro and in vivo . 
Wild-type mice and mice deﬁcient in inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) were infected intraperitoneally or orally with serovar Typhi strains . 
iNOS-deﬁcient mice were more susceptible to infection by both wild-type and rpoS mutant strains of serovar Typhi and showed extensive apoptotic liver damage compared with wild-type mice . 
Intracellular killing of Salmonella was analyzed with RAW 264 macrophage-like cells and primary peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice after cells were infected with the serovar Typhi parent or rpoS mutant strain . 
The rpoS mutant was more susceptible to killing by macrophages than was the wild-type strain . 
Also , the wild-type strain produced more extensive apoptotic changes in macrophages than did

1. Introduction
Nitric oxide ( NO ) , which is generated in excess by inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) , has antimicrobial actions against various pathogens via its cytotoxic or cytostatic effects [ 1 -- 5 ] . 
NO-mediated cytoprotective functions during host defense have also been demonstrated [ 1,6 ] . 
Macrophages produce NO in response to a variety of stimuli via induction of iNOS [ 7 ] , and these cells subsequently generate reactive nitrogen oxides such as peroxynitrite ( ONOO ) , NO2 , N2O3 , and S-nitrosothiols K after reaction of NO with reactive oxygen species .

reactive NO derivatives have been implicated in host defense and NO-induced cytotoxicity [ 1,4 -- 6,8 -- 11 ] . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is a human pathogen that causes typhoid fever . 
After being ingested with contaminated food or water , serovar Typhi bacteria adhere to and invade microfold and epithelial cells in the distal small intestine [ 12,13 ] . 
Subsequently , the microorganisms disseminate through the reticuloendothelial system , and clinical symptoms of typhoid fever ensue [ 12 ] . 
Other Salmonella serovars , i.e. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , S. enterica serovar Dublin , and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis , usually do not cause disseminated systemic disease but manifest clinically as gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans [ 14 ] . 
Human typhoid fever is regarded as analogous to murine salmonellosis , which is caused by serovar Typhimurium . 
Serovar Typhi and serovar Typhimurium can both survive inside macrophages in vitro and are showing cytotoxic by 
Among a number of pathogenic factors of Salmonella , the sigma factor RpoS ( KatF ) is a global stationary-phase regulator that is required for the virulence of serovar Typhimurium [ 19 ] . 
The rpoS mutant is sensitive to various stresses induced by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , starvation , and acidic conditions in vitro [ 19 ] , and its pathogenicity is attenuated because the virulent spv ( Salmonella plasmid virulence ) genes of serovar Typhimurium are encoded by a plasmid regulated by RpoS [ 20 ] . 
In fact , the serovar Typhimurium rpoS mutant is reported to have a decreased ability to colonize murine Peyer 's patches [ 21 ] . 
However , serovar Typhi does not have a virulence-associated plasmid , and proteins controlling pathogenesis are all encoded on the main chromosome ; the role of RpoS in the pathogenesis of Salmonella serovar Typhi is thus not fully understood . 
Khan et al. [ 16 ] showed earlier that a mutant strain deﬁcient in RpoS ( Salmonella Typhi Gifu 3P330 ) , which was produced from its parent Typhi strain , was less cytotoxic than the parent strain in the human promonocytic cell line THP-1 ; the mutant was also more sensitive to starvation , low pH , and H2O2 compared with the parent strain . 
Our recent study clearly indicated that NO had potent antimicrobial activity in mice during infection with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium [ 1 ] . 
It remains unclear , however , whether RpoS is involved in resistance of Salmonella Typhi to NO-dependent host defense . 
We therefore explored the contribution of serovar Typhi RpoS to resistance to NO-mediated host defense . 
Speciﬁcally , we examined the function of RpoS by analyzing the effect of a lack of RpoS on pathogenicity of the serovar Typhi rpoS mutant and its parent strain in infected iNOS-deﬁcient and wild-type mice and in the infected murine macrophages in culture . 
Susceptibility of the Typhi strains to peroxynitrite was also evaluated with a cell-free bactericidal assay . 
Data presented here demonstrated that Salmonella Typhi RpoS confers resistance to NO or its reactive nitrogen oxides , which have a critical role in the antimicrobial defense of the host during Salmonella Typhi infection , and that RpoS thus contributes to the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhi .

2. Results
2.1 . 
Effect of NO on mortality of mice infected with Salmonella serovar Typhi and role of RpoS in vivo resistance of serovar Typhi to NO 
An earlier study suggested that RpoS confers resistance of Salmonella Typhimurim to NO [ 1,19 ] . 
The rpoS mutant Typhimurium is also reported to be sensitive to stress caused by oxidants , starvation , and acidic conditions in vitro [ 19 ] . 
To evaluate the possibility of similar characteristics of serovar Typhi , wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice were injected i.p. with an isogenic rpoS-deﬁcient Typhi Gifu 3P330 or the parent strain Gifu 3P91 . 
In general , the iNOS-deﬁcient mice were found to be susceptible to infection with both strains of serovar Typhi , whereas wild-type mice were resistant to the infection at this dose of Typhi , as evidenced by the survival and LD50 data of the infected animals ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1 ) . 
To understand the role of RpoS in resistance to NO , LD50s of parent Typhi strain Gifu 3P91 and ropS mutant Gifu 3P330 were determined in both wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice ( Table 1 ) . 
Serovar Typhi strains we used have high LD50 in wild-type mice as was observed in earlier studies [ 22 ] . 
In wild-type mice , Gifu 3P91 strain is more virulent than rpoS mutant strain Gifu 3P330 , because the LD50 is more than three times higher for Gifu 3P330 than Gifu 3P91 . 
On the other hand , although LD50s in iNOS-deﬁcient mice are much lower than wild-type mice , such difference between two strains was not observed in iNOS-deﬁcent mice . 
This indicates that rpoS plays a signiﬁcant role in resistance to NO in vivo . 
In accordance with this LD50 study , growth of both Typhi strains was more efﬁcient in iNOS-deﬁcient mice than in wild-type mice ( Table 2 ) . 
Infection with the Gifu 3P91 strain tended to produce a slightly stronger lethal effect than that with the Gifu 3P330 ( rpoS mutant ) strain in iNOS-deﬁcient mice . 
This trend was consistent with bacterial growth in the liver and spleen ( Table 2 ) : a somewhat higher bacterial yield for the 
Gifu 3P91 strain was found compared with that for the rpoS mutant . 
Although there was no apparent mortality of wild-type mice infected with either the parent Typhi Gifu 3P91 strain or the with its rpoS mutant with a dose of 3.2 ! 
10 CFU in wild-type 7 mice , the groups of wild-type mice infected with the two Typhi strains demonstrated a signiﬁcant difference in loss of body weight ( Fig. 1B ) and in bacterial yield in the liver and spleen as well ( Table 2 ) . 
Therefore , the parent Gifu 3P91 strain seemed to show higher virulence in wild-type mice compared with the isogenic rpoS mutant strain . 
In addition , wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice were infected orally with a dose of 1.8 ! 
10 CFU of Typhi rpoS 8 mutant or the wild-type Gifu 3P91 strain . 
Although these oral infections were not lethal , the parent Typhi Gifu 3P91 strain appeared to affect the wild-type mice to a greater extent than did Typhi rpoS mutant , as assessed by the change in body weight : wild-type mice infected with the rpoS-null mutant recovered earlier compared with infected groups of iNOSdeﬁcient mice ( Fig. 1C ) . 
In iNOS-deﬁcient mice infected orally , however , both Typhi strains produced similar proﬁles of body weight changes , to the same degree as that observed in wild-type mice infected orally with the Typhi Gifu 3P91 strain . 
These results indicate that serovar Typhi causes a more lethal infection in iNOS-deﬁcient mice than in wild-type animals , which suggests a role for NO in host defense against Salmonella Typhi infection . 
These ﬁndings also veriﬁed that RpoS has a protective function against NO or its reactive derivatives during serovar Typhi infection . 
2.2. Widespread hepatocellular apoptosis in iNOS-deﬁcient mice infected with Salmonella serovar Typhi
To further examine the mechanism of higher mortality of iNOS-deﬁcient mice infected with serovar Typhi , as just mentioned , apoptotic liver damage caused by Typhi infection was evaluated by the in situ TUNEL method . 
Wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice received an i.p. dose of 5 ! 
10 CFU of 6 serovar Typhi rpoS mutant or the parent Typhi Gifu 3P9 strain . 
On day 5 after infection , we found that mice lacking iNOS had widespread apoptotic changes in liver tissues infected with the parent Typhi strain or the rpoS mutant ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In contrast , both Typhi strains caused less apoptosis in wild-type mice than in iNOS-deﬁcient mice . 
Nevertheless , the parent serovar Typhi strain did produce more extensive , but rather focal , liver damage compared with the rpoS mutant ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Fig. 2B , which shows morphometric analysis of the number of TUNEL-positive cells in wild-type and iNOSdeﬁcient mice , again illustrates a much higher level of apoptotic change in the liver of iNOS-deﬁcient mice after infection with both Typhi strains . 
Although there seems to be a trend of somewhat higher levels of apoptotic changes in liver iinfected with parent ( wild-type ) strain ( Gifu 3P91 ) , compared with that with its RpoS mutant ( Gifu 3P330 ) , no statistical difference was found between these two groups ( P ! 
0.05 ) . 
Table 1 
LD50s for two serovar Typhi strains in wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice Typhi strain LD ( No . 
of CFU/mouse ) a 50 iNOS mice iNOS mice C/C K/K 
This data is further supported by the same TUNEL analysis for the primary macrophages infected with each Typhi strain ( cf. Fig. 4 ) . 
In any event , these results indicate that the increased pathogenicity of Salmonella Typhi in iNOS-deﬁcient mice and relatively higher virulence of the parent Typhi Gifu 3P91 than the rpoS mutant are due to enhancement of apoptotic change in the liver and efﬁcient bacterial growth in these mice . 
2.3. Effect of iNOS inhibition on intracellular killing of Salmonella Typhi in RAW 264 cells and primary macrophages in culture
NO was recently shown to be a potent antimicrobial molecule for controlling serovar Typhimurium infection in cultured macrophages [ 5 ] . 
To evaluate antimicrobial activity of NO against serovar Typhi in vitro , we used RAW 264 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in culture . 
Treatment with N-u monomethyl L-arginine ( L-NMMA ; 1 mM ) for 48 h almost completely inhibited the release of NO by Typhi-infected RAW 264 macrophages ( data not shown ) . 
Counts of viable bacteria recovered from macrophage lysates obtained at 4 and 15 h afte 
LD50s were determined by the method of Reed and Muench [ 40 ] . 
Male 8-week-old male mice ( nZ10 -- 20 for each group ) were infected i.p. to determine LD50s . 
gentamicin treatment are shown in Fig. 3A . 
In the absence of L-NMMA , the wild-type Typhi strain was signiﬁcantly more resistant to macrophage bactericidal activity than was the rpoSnull mutant at both 4 and 15 h after infection , which suggests contribution of RpoS to NO resistance of these bacteria . 
Treatment of Typhi-infected cells with L-NMMA signiﬁcantly augmented intracellular survival of the rpoS mutant , and the difference in the intracellular bacterial yield observed for the

L-NMMA-untreated cells disappeared between the strains . 
For each set of experiment we estimated the initial internalized intracellular bacteria , ( i.e. at time zero after the 90 min infection period ) in the macrophage , which was found to be similar for both the strains and we also observed a quick overall decline of viable Salmonella count during the extended ( 20 h or more ) period of incubation ( data not shown ) . 
We observed an anti-Salmonella activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages against serovar Typhi with the same kinetics of intracellular killing as that of RAW 264 macrophages ( Fig. 3B ) ; although the bacterial yield in the primary macrophages was relatively higher than in the RAW 
264 cells after Typhi infections , possibly due to a different efﬁcacy of phagocytosis between the cells . 
The bacterial growth of both Typhi strains was signiﬁcantly lower in wildtype mouse macrophages than in iNOS-deﬁcient macrophages at 4 and 15 h after infection . 
Also , in wild-type macrophages , the parent Typhi Gifu 3P91 was more virulent than its rpoSnull mutant Gifu 3P330 , because the bacterial growth was signiﬁcantly higher for Gifu 3P91 than Gifu 3P330 at each time point after infection . 
The role of RpoS in resistance to NO was further clariﬁed by the same level of bacterial growth between both Gifu 3P91 and Gifu 3P330 in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse macrophage at 4 h after infection . 
Although there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P ! 
0.05 ) in bacterial growth between two strains in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse macrophages at 15 h after infection , it was not as great as in wild-type mouse macrophages ( P ! 
0.01 ) ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Nevertheless , this tendency , if any , may be due to NO-independent antimicrobial actions of macrophages , in which superoxide/H2O2-mediated host defense may be involved somehow in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse peritoneal macrophages , because rpoS mutant is susceptible to

H2O2 as described below ( cf. Fig. 5A ) . 
In fact , the difference in bacterial growth between two strains at 15 h in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse peritoneal macrophages was not necessarily consistent with in vitro studies with RAW 264 cells ( Fig. 3A ) , in vivo LD50s ( Table 1 ) and survival studies ( Fig. 1 ) , and apoptotic index measured in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse macrophages ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Therefore , it can be interpreted that , in the absence of NO , the rpoS mutant Gifu 3P330 has a pathogenic potential almost similar to its parent strain Gifu 3P91 . 
2.4 . 
Apoptosis induction in wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient primary macrophages infected with Salmonella serovar Typhi 
In our in vivo study , we observed more extensive liver damage in iNOS-deﬁcient mice than in wild-type mice after serovar Typhi infection , with greater virulence of rpoS-competent strain than its rpoS-null mutant ( Fig. 2 ) . 
To conﬁrm this data in vitro , we examined the difference in apoptosis induction between serovar Typhi-infected wild-type and iNOSdeﬁcient mouse macrophages . 
Thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice . 
Macrophages were infected with serovar Typhi strains at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 50 , and 15 h after infection , apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL method ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Irrespective of the bacterial strain , a signiﬁcantly larger number of apoptotic cells were detected for iNOS-deﬁcient mouse macrophages , compared with wildtype mouse macrophages ( Fig. 4A and B ) . 
The wild-type macrophages infected with Serovar Typhi Gifu 3P91 showed a higher level of apoptosis than did the cells infected with the rpoS mutant Gifu 3P330 ; whereas there was no signiﬁcant difference in apoptotic changes observed in the iNOS-deﬁcient macophages between two strains . 
This indicates again a potential role of RpoS in resistance to NO-mediated antimicrobial activity . 
All these in vitro ﬁndings thus support our interpretation that NO exerts antimicrobial activity against serovar Typhi and than RpoS confers Salmonella serovar Typhi resistance to NO-mediated cytotoxicity .

Susceptibility of Salmonella serovar Typhi to peroxynitrite and to an oxidant 
6.2 
6.0 
Because the two Typhi strains showed signiﬁcantly different pathogenicity in both the in vivo infection ( Fig. 1 ) and the in vitro macrophage assay ( Fig. 3 ) , it was thought that Salmonella virulence may depend on resistance to reactive nitrogen species derived from NO , which is conferred by RpoS of Salmonella Typhi . 
To test this idea , stationary-phase serovar Typhi strains were exposed to peroxynitrite , and survivability was monitored after speciﬁed time intervals ( Fig. 5 ) . 
H2O2 was used as a standard oxidant . 
After exposure to 10 mM H2O2 for 60 min , the virulent parent Gifu 3P91 strain had better survival compared with the rpoS mutant ( Fig. 5A ) . 
More important , the viability of the Gifu 3P91 strain remained high even after a 30-min treatment with the constant concentration of peroxynitrite ( 21.7 mM ) : the initial inoculum of 10 CFU/ml of the rpoS mutant was almost completely 8 eliminated , but the Gifu 3P91 strain showed appreciable survival ( Fig. 5B ) .

Thus , reduced in vivo pathogenicity and increased susceptibility to macrophage microbicidal activity of the rpoS mutant could be attributed to reduced resistance to NO-derived reactive nitrogen oxides such as peroxynitrite , possibly because of the lack of RpoS in the mutant bacteria . 
3. Discussion
Earlier studies with experimental animals reported by our group and other groups suggest a critical function of iNOS in host defense against Salmonella infection [ 1,5,23 -- 25 ] . 
For example , iNOS-deﬁcient mice showed increased mortality [ 1,24,25 ] and severe hepatocellular apoptosis [ 1 ] after i.p infection with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium . 
Furthermore , macrophages derived from these animals demonstrated impaired killing of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium even during the early ( ! 
4 h ) phase of intracellular killing of the 
Here , we investigated the role of iNOS during infection with Salmonella serovar Typhi , with a focus on the role of the rpoS gene in serovar Typhi virulence and the contribution of this gene to resistance to NO-mediated host defense . 
We found here that , similar to the situation in serovar Typhimurium infection in mice , NO constituted a critical factor in host defense against serovar Typhi infection . 
More important , our ﬁndings suggested that the rpoS gene is involved in both in vivo and in vitro virulence and resistance to NO and its reactive derivative peroxynitrite . 
Thus , iNOS expression may contribute , at least in part , to the natural resistance of mice to serovar Typhi infection . 
We reported earlier that serovar Typhimurium infection caused much more extensive apoptotic liver damage in iNOSdeﬁcient mice than in wild-type mice [ 1 ] . 
Moreover , we observed that iNOS-deﬁcient mice also showed marked apoptosis in Peyer 's patch tissue after oral infection with the virulent serovar Typhimurium [ unpublished results ] . 
Similarly , here we found extensive apoptosis in liver tissue and peritoneal macrophages of iNOS-deﬁcient mice after infection with serovar Typhi . 
It is now well appreciated that NO has potent antiapoptotic activity [ 1,8 ] . 
In contrast , the host cells ' apoptosis might be induced not only by Salmonella infection per se but also by oxidative stress produced via inﬂammatory responses of the host against Salmonella infection [ 8,26 ] . 
Therefore , it is logical to expect that NO mediates effective host defense via its potent antiapoptotic effect , by preventing host cell apoptosis induced by Salmonella . 
In our earlier study , the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium LT2 strain , which has a defective rpoS allele , showed reduced virulence in wild-type mice and was also much more susceptible to the bactericidal effect of peroxynitrite compared with a virulent Gifu 12142 strain [ 1 ] . 
We obtained similar results in our current work for Salmonella Typhi infection in vivo . 
We also clearly demonstrated a role for RpoS in resistance of Salmonella Typhi to NO , in that intracellular survival of the rpoS mutant was increased in RAW 264 cells when NO synthesis was inhibited and in iNOS-deﬁcient mouse peritoneal macrophages . 
The difference in the efﬁcacy of bacterial killing between the parent strain and the rpoS-null strain was nulliﬁed after inhibition of NO synthesis and in the absence of iNOS expression . 
It is well accepted the antibacterial effect of NO is mostly mediated by reactive nitrogen oxides derived from NO [ 8,27,28 ] . 
For example , NO reacts with superoxide in a diffusion-limited reaction to yield peroxynitrite [ 27,29,30 ] , which is a strong oxidant and nitrating agent , with resultant potent cytotoxic effects on various microbes [ 31 ] . 
In fact , our present data showed that the parent Typhi Gifu 3P91 strain , which was resistant to the bactericidal effect of peroxynitrite , was more invasive and pathogenic in iNOS-competent wild-type mice and more resistant to the macrophage bactericidal action than was the peroxynitritesusceptible rpoS-null Gifu 3P330 strain . 
The greater in vivo pathogenicity of the serovar Typhi Gifu 3P91 strain may be attributed to a higher resistance to peroxynitrite or other oxidants such as H2O2 . 
These results strongly support the idea that RpoS plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhi by rendering the bacteria resistant to NO-mediated host defense . 
RpoS is a global stationary-phase alternative sigma transcription factor that controls the expression of the regulons of 30 or more genes [ 20 ] . 
Mutations in the rpoS gene encoding s impair bacterial starvation-related survival , s virulence , and resistance to oxidative , acid , thermal , osmotic stress and DNA damage [ 20,32 ] . 
Other sigma factors , sigma 32 ( RpoH ) , and RpoE , regulate heat shock proteins required for survival under various stressful conditions [ 33 ] . 
Testerman et al. [ 34 ] recently reported an important antioxidant role for RpoE during Salmonella infection of mammalian hosts . 
They also provided evidence that the s regulon complements the E s regulon , which allows Salmonella to withstand oxidative s stress during the stationary phase of growth in vitro and to resist oxygen-dependent innate host defense during infection in vivo . 
It was previously reported that the regulatory system mediated by RpoS in serovar Typhi was activated by the intracellular environment of the macrophage [ 16 ] . 
However , it remained unclear whether or how these factors function in virulence or NO detoxiﬁcation or resistance during the intracellular proliferation of serovar Typhi . 
Several microbial resistance genes have been studied most extensively for serovar Typhimurium , which include the stress regulons OxyR ( H2O2 response regulator , e.g. Kat , catalase ) and SoxS

( B ) Peroxynitrite was infused into the bacterial suspension ( M9 medium ) so that the concentration of peroxynitrite in the reaction mixture was maintained at a constant 21.7 mM . 
At different intervals during treatment , the number of viable bacteria remaining in the reaction mixture was determined by means of the colony-forming assay .

The Typhi rpoS may thus help the bacteria escape from the toxic effects of NO or its reactive derivatives and protect them from these effects , by acting in a concerted manner with the other microbial resistance genes . 
Identiﬁcation of the molecular mechanism of detoxiﬁcation of reactive nitrogen oxides such as peroxynitrite by Typhi RpoS remains a challenge for further research . 
In conclusion , it is now clear that hosts respond to Salmonella Typhi infection by expressing iNOS so that NO is produced , and that NO has an important effect via its potent antiapoptotic and direct antibacterial activities . 
The Typhi serovar , however , confronts this NO-dependent host defense by expressing RpoS and other related protective systems against NO or peroxynitrite during infection . 
The pathogenesis of Typhi infection thus seems to be determined by a delicate balance between responses of the host and the pathogen , as regulated by diverse biological functions of NO . 
4. Materials and methods
4.1. Animals and bacteria culture
Homozygous iNOS-deﬁcient mice ( iNOS ) , obtained K/K from Jackson Laboratories ( West Grove , PA ) , were used to produce heterozygous iNOS-deﬁcient mice ( iNOS ) , by C/K mating with their wild-type counterparts ( iNOS ) , as C/C described earlier [ 9 ] . 
Littermates ( iNOS and iNOS ) K/K C/C bred from the same iNOS parents were used throughout the C/K study . 
All experiments were carried out according to the Guidelines of the Laboratory Protocol of Animal Handling , 
Kumamoto University . 
Two S. enterica serovar Typhi strains were used : wild-type Gifu 3P91 strain and its rpoS mutant Gifu 3P330 , which was produced by disrupting rpoS of the parent Gifu 3P91 strain , as described earlier [ 16 ] . 
Bacteria were grown overnight in brain -- heart infusion ( BHI ) broth ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , MI ) at 37 8C for routine culture . 
M9 minimal medium ( 7 mg/ml Na2HPO4 , 3 mg/ml KH2PO4 , 0.5 mg/ml NaCl , 1 mg/ml NH4Cl , 5 mg/ml thiamine , 0.12 mg/ml MgSO4 , 0.015 mg/ml CaCl2 , and 2 mg/ml glucose ) was used for the peroxynitrite susceptibility assay to exclude potential scavengers of peroxynitrite from the nutrient medium . 
The number of bacteria was determined by means of a colony-forming assay with the use of deoxycholatehydrogen sulfate-lactose agar ( Nissui , Tokyo , Japan ) or BHI agar plates . 
MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the two study strains were determined by conventional methods and were found to be similar 
Bacteria were grown overnight to stationary phase ( 17 -- 18 h ) at 37 8C in BHI broth in still culture and were then washed with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) two times . 
The optical density ( at 620 nm ) was measured to adjust the bacterial cell density and also viable count was done from the inoculums administered , which did not vary . 
A suspension of serovar Typhi Gifu 3P91 or its rpoS mutant in 0.2 ml of 0.01 M sodium phosphatebuffered 0.15 M saline ( PBS ; pH 7.4 ) was administered intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) or orally to the mice . 
At various times after administration , body weight and survival rate of the mice were monitored . 
Mice were fasted for 24 h before the oral challenge with serovar Typhi . 
In addition , mice were killed to obtain liver and spleen samples for determining bacterial growth . 
The number of bacteria was quantiﬁed by use of the colony-forming assay as just described . 
Brieﬂy , the liver or spleen was weighed and homogenized in ice-cold PBS 
( PBS : liver of 9:1 , vol/wt ) by using a Polytron homogenizer ( Kinematica GmbH , Lucerne , Switzerland ) . 
The resultant liver or spleen homogenate was then serially diluted and was subjected to the colony-forming assay after culture for 18 h at 37 8C . 
4.3. Identiﬁcation of the apoptotic change in the liver and cultured macrophages occurring during infection
Apoptotic change in the liver occurring during Salmonella infection was analyzed by use of the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase ( TdT ) - mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) assay , with an in situ apoptosis detection kit ( TACS ; Trevigen , Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) , as described earlier ( 1 ) . 
The TUNEL procedure was performed with 6-mm-thick sections , followed by a streptavidin-labeled peroxidase reaction with TACS Blue Label for blue coloration . 
Sections were examined by light microscopy , TUNEL-positive cells were counted , and values were expressed per square millimeter of section . 
For in vitro analysis of apoptotic changes in peritoneal macrophage , cells were cultured on chamber slides ( FALCON Culture Slide ; Becton Dickinson Labware , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . 
After 15 h incubation , wells were washed twice with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and cells were ﬁxed with 3.7 % buffered formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature . 
The cells were then used for TUNEL assay as described above . 
4.4. Cell culture
The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264 was obtained from Riken Cell Bank , Tsukuba , Japan , and maintained in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Invitrogen Corp. , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals , St Louis , MO ) at 37 8C under 5 % CO2/95 % air . 
Cells were washed gently with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and were removed from the ﬂask by scraping . 
The cells were then plated and cultured in 24-well plates with DMEM at a density of 10 cells 5 per well for antimicrobial analysis as described below .

4.5. Isolation and culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages
Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from the thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal exudate . 
Wild-type and iNOS-deﬁcient mice were injected i.p. with 1 ml 3 % thioglycolate broth . 
Three days later , mouse peritoneal lavage was collected by using 10 ml ice-cold PBS . 
The lavage was centrifuged at 170 ! 
g for 10 min at 4 8C and suspended in DMEM containing 10 % FCS and 10 mg/ml gentamicin . 
For bactericidal assay 5 ! 
10 cells and for TUNEL analysis 8 ! 
5 10 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and four-well chamber 5 slides , respectively . 
After 4 h incubation at 37 8C under 5 % CO2 , nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) . 
Adherent cells were incubated at 37 8C under 5 % CO2 for overnight in DMEM containing 10 % FCS . 
4.6. Infection of cultured macrophages
Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 8C in BHI broth in still culture and were then washed with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) two times . 
The optical density ( at 620 nm ) was measured to adjust the bacterial cell density to 10 CFU/ml , or bacterial suspension 8 was further diluted in DMEM . 
The bacterial suspension was added to wells at an MOI of 100 for RAW 264 cells and at an MOI of 10 for peritoneal macrophage . 
Plates were centrifuged at 130 ! 
g for 5 min to synchronize the infection followed by incubation at 37 8C under 5 % CO2 for 90 min for RAW 264 cells and 30 min for peritoneal macrophages . 
Subsequently , plates were washed three times with prewarmed PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and were incubated with media containing 100 mg/ml gentamicin for 1 h , followed by culture with DMEM containing 50 mg/ml gentamicin for the rest of the experiment . 
For infection of peritoneal macrophages , bacteria were opsonized with 10 % normal mouse serum at 37 8C for 30 min before infection . 
4.7. Assessment of intracellular growth of bacteria
Intracellular killing of bacteria by RAW 264 cells or mouse peritoneal macrophages was assessed by means of the standard gentamicin assay [ 38 ] . 
At the end of the infection period , the infected RAW 264 cells or peritoneal macrophages were treated with 100 mg/ml gentamicin to kill the extracellular bacteria . 
At 4 and 15 h after the start of infection , the supernatant was removed and cells were washed three times with DMEM and lysed with 0.1 % Triton X-100 . 
Serial dilutions of the lysates were plated onto BHI agar to allow colony formation for quantiﬁcation of intracellular bacteria . 
To determine the effect of NO production from NOS on intracellular bacterial growth , RAW 264 cells were treated with 1 mM L-NMMA for 48 h before infection with bacteria . 
Also , L-NMMA was added after 1 h of gentamicin treatment to avoid a possible effect of the inhibitor on the uptake of bacteria by the cells 
Stationary-phase bacteria were used for the bactericidal assay with peroxynitrite synthesized from nitrite and H2O2 as reported previously [ 1 ] . 
The two Typhi strains were treated with a steady concentration of peroxynitrite , obtained by constant-ﬂux infusion , according to a method described earlier [ 39 ] . 
By infusion of 50 mM peroxynitrite in 10 mM NaOH into M9 medium pH 7.2 ( 1.9 ml ) at a ﬂow rate of 3.3 ml/min , the peroxynitrite concentration of remained constant at 21.7 mM , as assessed by the dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation assay , described earlier [ 30 ] . 
The suspension of serovar Typhi ( 10 CFU/ml ) was treated with this constant concentration of 8 peroxynitrite , and aliquots ( 20 ml ) were removed from the reaction mixture at different time intervals and were immediately diluted with PBS . 
Viable bacteria were then quantiﬁed by use of the colony-forming assay as just described . 
As a control , decomposed peroxynitrite was used to treat bacteria . 
The susceptibility of the Typhi strains to H2O2 was also determined by adding H2O2 at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM to stationary-phase bacteria in BHI broth ; viable cells were counted via the colony-forming assay after various incubation periods .
