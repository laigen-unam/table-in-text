ABSTRACT 
Foodborne illness due to the consumption of contaminated raw or lightly cooked sprouts is a continuing food safety concern . 
In this study , we tested several plant-associated pseudomonads for their ability to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enterica both in vitro and in situ . 
An agar spot bioassay method was used with three different media . 
Only Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens 2-79 produced clear zones of inhibition when tested against ﬁve serovars of S. enterica , and activity was dependent on media type and serovar . 
The antibiosis by derivative strains of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 defective in the production of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and ﬂuorescent siderophore was not reduced , indicating that these known antimicrobial metabolites were not responsible for the inhibition observed in our studies . 
However , mutants defective in the regulatory gene gacS ( global antibiotic and cyanide control ) were severely reduced in inhibitory activity . 
In tryptic soy broth , the control cultures of a cocktail of S. enterica strains reached approximately 10 log CFU/ml by 24 h but , when coinoculated with P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 , reached only approximately 5 log CFU/ml . 
The addition of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 to the seed soak water prior to the germination of alfalfa seed previously inoculated with a cocktail of S. enterica strains led to an average reduction of 5 log CFU/g at 6 days of sprouting without an adverse effect on sprout yield or appearance . 
Time course studies indicated that S. enterica outgrowth was controlled on days 1 through 6 of sprouting . 
Competitive exclusion as a potential food safety intervention for seed sprouts merits further study . 
During the past decade , the consumption of raw or lightly cooked seed sprouts contaminated with Salmonella enterica or Escherichia coli O157 has been responsible for at least 27 outbreaks in the United States , resulting in more than 1,600 reported cases of foodborne illness ( 8 , 44 , 51 ) . 
Sprouts are one of the produce items most often associated with outbreaks of salmonellosis ( 41 ) . 
Because of the food safety concerns with sprouts , numerous studies on the use of various chemical and physical methods for eliminating bacterial human pathogens from sprout seed have been carried out ( 1 , 8 ) . 
In contrast , there have been few studies on the use of biological agents to control the outgrowth of human pathogens from contaminated sprout seed ( 25 , 32 , 56 ) . 
There is a great deal of published information on the biopreservation of foods with natural microﬂora , such as lactic acid bacteria ( 42 ) . 
Biological control has also been intensively studied as a means of controlling plant diseases since at least the early 1920s ( 3 ) , including the use of ﬂuo-rescent pseudomonads as antagonists ( 11 , 18 ) . 
More recently , the use of competing microorganisms ( in a technique often referred to as competitive exclusion ) to inhibit the growth and survival of human pathogens in a variety of animals has been studied ( 38 , 49 ) . 
Several commercial biological-based products are on the market worldwide for

use in controlling the colonization of newly hatched chicks with Salmonella ( 38 ) . 
Bacterial human pathogens are surprisingly good competitors on sprout surfaces when present initially on seed , and they can grow to high levels ( from 106 to 107 CFU/g ) on sprouting alfalfa seed ( 19 ) . 
However , an indication that competitive exclusion can occur naturally on alfalfa sprouts was evidenced by the small amount of growth these path-ogens showed ( 1 log or less ) when inoculated onto sprouts 1 to 5 days into the sprouting process ( 5 , 39 ) . 
Thus , the key to effective control may be in ensuring the presence of high levels of effective competitive microﬂora on the seed at the time of initial germination . 
In this study , we determined the ability of several plant-associated ﬂuorescent pseudomonads to inhibit S. enterica both in vitro and in situ on sprouting alfalfa seed . 
The majority of the strains tested are known biological control agents with activity against a variety of soilborne fungal plant diseases ( 36 ) . 
Fluorescent pseudomonads represent a major proportion of the population of native bacteria on sprouting seed ( 2 , 24 , 26 , 33 ) and thus appear well adapted to growth on sprout surfaces . 
Initial studies on the mode of action of the most antagonistic bacterium identiﬁed in this study , Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens 2-79 , are also included . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microbial strains . 
The plant pathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var . 
tritici ATCC 28229 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , Va. ) . 
The source and description of the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 .59.34.24 and 2-79B46 have mutations in the global regulatory gene gacS ( 46 ) . 
For long-term storage , bacteria were kept at 2808C in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ; BBL , Becton Dickinson , Sparks , Md. ) supplemented with 20 % glycerol ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo. ) . 
Frozen stock cultures of the pseudomonads were streaked on Pseudomonas agar F ( PAF ; BBL , Becton Dickinson ) with or without kanamycin ( Sigma ) , as appropriate , 1 day before the start of each experiment , with incubation at 288C . 
For the culturing of resistant strains ( 2-79 .59.34 , 2-79 .59.34.24 , and 2-79B46 ) , kanamycin was added to PAF for a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg/ml ( PAF1K ) . 
S. enterica serovars Anatum F4317 , Infantis F4319 , Newport H1275 , and Stanley H0558 were adapted to grow in the presence of streptomycin sulfate ( ﬁnal concentration , 1,000 mg/ml ; Sigma ) and nalidixic acid ( sodium salt ; ﬁnal concentration , 100 mg/ml ; Aldrich Chemical , Milwaukee , Wis. ) by standard procedures . 
Strains of S. enterica were maintained on tryptic soy agar ( TSA ; BBL , Becton Dickinson ) with or without the addition of antibiotics , as appropriate , at 4 C , with monthly transfers to fresh agar .

Test for protease activity . 
Litmus milk agar ( BBL , Becton Dickinson ) plates were inoculated in duplicate with P. ﬂuorescens strain 2-79 wild type and its derivatives . 
The plates were incubated at 288C for 48 h and then observed for zones of clearing that surrounded bacterial growth , indicative of protease activity . 
Test for pectolytic activity . 
Pectolytic activity was tested for according to Liao ( 23 ) with semisolid pectate medium ( pH 7.1 ) supplemented with casamino acids ( 0.3 % ; BBL , Becton Dickinson ) . 
The experiment was performed twice . 
Test for antifungal activity . 
To conﬁrm that the strains of 
Pseudomonas were producing antimicrobial compounds with antifungal activity as previously reported , the antifungal activity of each potential antagonistic bacterial strain was tested against G. graminis var . 
tritici on potato dextrose agar ( BBL , Becton Dickinson ) according to the method of Weller et al. ( 54 ) . 
Each strain was tested three times in independent experiments . 
Agar spot bioassays . 
Initially , a deferred agar spot bioassay method and a simultaneous method were compared , with P. ﬂuo-rescens 2-79 as the producer strain , S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 as the indicator strain , and Luria broth ( LB ; Invitrogen Life Sciences , Paisley , Scotland ) solidiﬁed by the addition of 15 g/liter of Bacto agar ( LA ; BBL , Becton Dickinson ) as the growth medium . 
Each culture dish ( 100 by 15 mm ) used for the agar spot bioassays contained 25 ml of media . 
For the simultaneous method , uninoculated plates of LA were overlaid with 6 ml of molten water agar ( Bacto agar , 6 % ; BBL , Becton Dickinson ) inoculated with 60 ml of an overnight culture ( approximately 9 log CFU/ml ) of S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 that had been grown in TSB ( 378C , with shaking at 250 rpm ) . 
After the overlay had solidiﬁed , 10 ml of an overnight broth culture ( TSB , 288C , 250 rpm ) of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was spotted ( two spots per plate per strain ) on the seeded agar surface , along with 10 ml of uninoculated TSB as a control . 
Plates were incubated at 288C , with readings taken at 24 and 48 h. For the deferred method , strain 2-79 was spotted onto LA , with incubation for 48 h at 288C . 
After incubation , bacterial cells were killed by a 1-h exposure to chloroform vapors under a chemical fume hood . 
Each plate was then overlaid with a suspension of S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 prepared in water agar as described above . 
After the overlaid medium had solidiﬁed , the plates were incubated at 378C . 
Zones of inhibition were measured from the outer edge of the producer colony to the outer edge of the inhibition zone for the indicator strain after 24 and 48 h of incubation . 
The experiments were performed three times On the basis of the information obtained by the initial results , all Pseudomonas strains were then tested by the deferred method , as stated above , for the production of antimicrobial substances , with activity against ﬁve indicator strains represented by ﬁve S. enterica serovars on LA as well as on the additional agar media PAF and malt agar ( MA ; ﬁnal pH of 5.3 ; Sigma ) . 
Duplicate plates were spotted with each Pseudomonas strain ( one spot per strain per plate ) per S. enterica serovar per media type for each experiment . 
When LA and MA were used , incubation was for 48 h before overlaying . 
For PAF , incubation was for 24 h. Inhibition was recorded 24 and 48 h after overlaying with S. enterica , as stated above . 
Deferred agar spot bioassays were also carried out as described above for selected Pseudomonas-Salmonella strain combinations on the following media : LA and MA prepared in 100 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer , pH 6.8 ( Sigma ) ( ﬁnal pH of 6.8 ) ; LA and PAF supplemented with FeCl · 6H O 3 2 ( 100 mM ; J. T. Baker Chemical Co. , Phillipsburg , N.J. ) ( ﬁnal pH of 6.7 and 7.0 , respectively ) ; and LA supplemented with glucose ( 20 g/liter , ﬁnal pH of 6.2 ; Sigma ) . 
Experiments were replicated independently at least three times . 
fusion test by the agar overlay method ( 27 ) was conducted to test a commercial preparation of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid ( PCA ; Chembridge Corporation , San Diego , Calif. ) for antibacterial activity against S. enterica serovar Anatum F4317 . 
PCA was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in methylene chloride and tested at up to 100 mg per disk . 
Methylene chloride ( 100 ml ) alone was added to disks as a control . 
The experiment was carried out two times , with duplicate assay plates per bacterium for each experiment . 
agar media . 
The effect of heating on the antimicrobial activity of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 on agar media was tested . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was spot inoculated onto four plates of LA ( one spot per plate ) and incubated for 48 h at 288C ; then , the bacteria were killed with chloroform vapors . 
Half of the plates were kept at 758C for 30 min to inactivate heat-labile inhibitory factors , and the other half ( unheated controls ) remained at room temperature . 
The colonies of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 were then overlaid with S. enterica Stanley H0558 as described above . 
After the agar overlays had solidiﬁed , plates were incubated at 378C . 
Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 and 48 h of incubation . 
The experiment was carried out two times . 
inhibitory agent ( s ) from clear zones of inhibition formed during agar spot bioassays to a fresh lawn of indicator bacteria was tested by stabbing the inhibition zone with a sterile wooden toothpick and then immediately stabbing a freshly prepared lawn of the same indicator bacterium overlaid onto the same agar medium at several locations . 
Lawns were observed for the formation of clear inhibition zones ( plaques ) after incubation at 378C for up to 48 h. Alternatively , agar plugs ( 1.5-mm diameter ) were aseptically cut from clear inhibition zones and crushed in 100 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , pH 7.4 . 
Then , 10 ml of chloroform was added with mixing , and the suspension was centrifuged to separate the aqueous and chloroform layers . 
Fifty microliters of the top aqueous layer was carefully removed , and serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared in sterile distilled water . 
Undiluted and diluted samples were spotted ( 10 ml ) onto a freshly prepared lawn of the appropriate indicator strain , with incubation at 378C . 
Plates were observed at 24 and 48 h for the formation of plaques . 
heat stability . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and its derivatives 2-79LacZ , 2-79 .59.34 , 2-79 .59.34.24 , and B46 were grown on PAF or PAF1K , as appropriate , at 288C for 48 h . 
A single colony of each strain was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB contained in 125-ml ﬂasks , one ﬂask per strain . 
Flask contents were shaken ( 250 rpm ) at 288C for 48 h . 
The cultures were subjected to centrifugation ( 10,000 3 g , 15 min , 48C ) , and the supernatant ﬂuids were collected ; then , each sample was ﬁltered through a 0.45-mm sterile ﬁlter ( Millex-GV , Millipore Corporation , Bedford , Mass. ) . 
For use as the indicator strain , S. enterica serovar Anatum F4317 was grown overnight ( 18 to 20 h ) in 10 ml of LB at 378C with shaking ( 250 rpm ) . 
Three hundred microliters of the overnight culture was suspended in 20 ml of molten ( 508C ) LA , and the molten agar was poured onto a culture plate ( 100 by 15 mm ) . 
After cooling , three equidistant wells were cut from each plate with a sterile # 3 cork borer ( 6-mm diameter ) . 
To two of the wells , 50 ml of cellfree culture supernatant was added . 
To the third well , 50 ml of LB alone was added as a negative control . 
Plates were then incubated at 378C and observed for the formation of inhibition zones surrounding the wells at 24 and 48 h . 
A similar experiment was performed with P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 both as the producer strain and as the indicator strain . 
Duplicate bioassay plates were used per experiment per strain , and the experiments were replicated once . 
Cell-free supernatants from strain 2-79 were also subjected to heating in a boiling water bath for 10 min . 
After allowing the treated supernatants to cool to room temperature , both heated and nonheated cell-free supernatants , along with LB alone as a negative control , were added to the wells , and the experiment was continued as described above . 
The experiment was performed three times . 
enterica in broth culture . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and its derivatives 2-79LacZ , 2-79 .59.34 , 2-79 .59.34.24 , and 2-79B46 were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of a cocktail of the ﬁve S. enterica strains in TSB following procedures similar to those of Zhao et al. ( 57 ) . 
The P. ﬂuorescens strains were cultured in TSB overnight ( 288C , 250 rpm ) . 
Then , the cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed once with sterile puriﬁed water , and recentrifuged . 
The ﬁnal cell pellets were suspended in sterile puriﬁed water to give an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.10 ( approximately 8 log CFU/ml ) . 
The ﬁve S. enterica serovars used as indicators for the agar spot bioassays described above were prepared in the same manner , except that the ﬁve overnight cultures were combined before harvesting . 
The suspensions of the individual P. ﬂuorescens strains were diluted 10-fold , and the suspensions of the S. enterica cocktail were diluted 10,000-fold . 
One milliliter of the pseudomonad culture was added to 10 ml of TSB contained in a 125-ml ﬂask to give a starting population of approximately 5 log CFU/ml ; similarly , 1 ml of the pathogen cocktail was added to give a starting population of approximately 3 log CFU/ml . 
One ﬂask was inoculated with the Salmonella cocktail alone as a control . 
The ﬂasks were incubated with shaking ( 250 rpm ) at 248C , and samples were removed to prepare serial decimal dilutions in sterile 0.1 % peptone water at 0 , 6 , and 24 h of incubation . 
Dilutions were plated in triplicate on TSA ( for total bacterial counts -- Pseudomonas plus S. enterica ) and XLT-4 ( BBL , Becton Dickinson ) ( for S. enterica ) . 
Preliminary experiments indicated that P. ﬂuorescens strain 2-79 did not grow on XLT-4 after 24 h of incubation at 378C . 
The inoculated TSA plates were incubated at 288C for 48 h , and the XLT-4 plates were incubated at 378C for 24 h before colonies were counted . 
Subtraction of the S. enterica population ( as determined on XLT-4 ) from the total bacterial populations ( as determined on TSA ) equalled the population of the ﬂuorescent pseudomonad strains . 
alfalfa seed for sprouting was purchased from the Caudill Seed Company ( Louisville , Ky. ) . 
To prepare the seed inoculum , the four antibiotic-resistant strains of S. enterica were used to inoculate single tubes containing 2 ml of TSB , and the cultures were incubated with shaking ( 250 rpm ) at 378C for 18 to 20 h. Starter cultures ( 0.1 ml each ) were then used to inoculate 25 ml of TSB , and the cultures were incubated as stated above . 
Samples ( 1 ml ) from each of the four ﬂasks were combined , and the remainder of each was used to determine the pathogen populations of the individual cultures by preparing serial decimal dilutions with sterile 0.1 % peptone water and plating in triplicate onto TSA plus streptomycin ( 1,000 mg/ml ) and nalidixic acid ( 100 mg/ml ) ( TSASN ) . 
Bacterial cells in the combined samples were pelleted by centrifugation , and the cell pellets were washed once with sterile 0.1 % peptone water . 
Then , the washed cells were recentrifuged , and the ﬁnal pellet was taken up in 2 ml of sterile 0.1 % peptone water . 
Alfalfa seed ( 400 g ) was placed in a sterile stomacher bag with a nylon-mesh liner . 
Sterile distilled water ( 200 ml ) and 40 ml of inoculum were added to the bag . 
The remainder of the procedure , including a determination of the initial inoculum load on the seed , was performed as previously described ( 7 ) . 
The inoculated seed was stored at 48C until use . 
The bioassays were carried out in small glass vials similar to the experiments conducted by Matos and Garland ( 25 ) . 
The Pseudomonas strains to be tested as antagonists were cultured at 288C overnight . 
Single colonies were used to inoculate 2 ml of TSB , and the cultures were incubated at 288C for 18 to 20 h with shaking ( 250 rpm ) . 
The cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed once with sterile distilled water , and recentrifuged . 
The ﬁnal cell pellets were suspended in sterile distilled water to give an OD of 0.10 ( approximately 8 log CFU/ml ) . 
For each antag-600 onist strain to be tested , seven seeds previously inoculated with the cocktail of S. enterica serovars were placed in 2 ml of the antagonist inoculum and left to sit at room temperature on the laboratory bench for 2 h . 
As negative controls , two sets of seven inoculated seeds were each placed in 2 ml of sterile distilled water . 
After 2 h , seeds were transferred to sterile glass vials ( 17 ml ) lined at the bottom with two wetted disks of ﬁlter paper ( Whatman no. 2 , Whatman , Maidstone , UK ) . 
The bioassay vials were left to sit on the laboratory bench at room temperature ( 22 6 18C ) , and additional sterile distilled water was added as required .

Competitive inhibition with respect to the growth of S. 
After 6 days of incubation , all plant materials were aseptically removed from each vial , and the materials were gently blotted dry between sheets of paper towels and weighed . 
Each sample was then homogenized with a sterile hand-held glass tissue grinder in the presence of 2 ml of sterile 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , pH 6.8 . 
Serial decimal dilutions were prepared in sterile 0.1 % peptone water , and 0.1 ml of undiluted or diluted sample was plated in triplicate onto TSASN . 
Plates were kept at 378C , and colonies were counted after 24 and 48 h of incubation . 
Selected colonies were conﬁrmed as S. enterica by slide agglutination tests with Salmonella O antiserum Poly A-I and Vi ( BBL , Becton Dickinson ) . 
The CFU per gram data for the two separate controls of each experiment were averaged , and these values were used to determine the log reductions obtained for the antagonists . 
Each potential antagonist was tested in three separate experiments . 
Subsequently , time course studies with P. ﬂuorescens strain 2-79 as the antagonist were carried out . 
The procedure was the same as stated above with the following modiﬁcations : 10 seeds carrying S. enterica per vial were used instead of seven ; sampling was performed on days 0 ( immediately after the 2-h soak period ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 ; on day 0 , the entire 2-ml sample was plated ( 250 ml per plate ) for all samples ; and on days 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 , the undiluted samples from the pathogen-inoculated seeds treated with strain 2-79 were plated in quadruplicate ( 250 ml per plate ) . 
The experiment was repeated three times .

of siderophore production by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 .59.34 and 2-79 .59.34.24 was conﬁrmed by culturing on PAF for 24 h at 288C and then observing the growth under UV light ( 365 nm ) . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79LacZ and Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84Z were conﬁrmed to produce b-galactosidase after growth on LA supplemented with 0.2 % X-Gal ( 5-bro-mo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside ) for 24 to 48 h at 378C , whereas the parental strains P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and P. aureofaciens 30-84 were negative for b-galactosi-dase activity . 
P. ﬂuorescens strains 2-79 , 2-79LacZ , and 2-79 .59.34 were positive for protease activity , whereas strains 2-79 .59.34.24 and 2-79B46 were negative . 
None of the ﬂuorescent pseudomonads showed pecto-lytic activity when tested for the formation of pits on semi-solid pectate agar media , except for the positive control strain Pseudomonas marginalis ATCC 10844 .

RESULTS Bacterial phenotype and characterization . 
The lack 
Agar spot bioassays . 
Initial results indicated that the antibiosis exhibited by strain P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 against S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 on LA was most evident by use of the deferred method , with large clear zones of inhibition extending outward ( an average of 11 mm from the edge of the colonies ) ( Table 2 ) . 
When it was grown simultaneously on LA with incubation at 288C , clear inhibition zones were produced for only 13 of the 20 areas where P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was spotted , and the inhibition zones were quite small , extending 2 to 3 mm from the edge of the Pseudomonas colonies . 
The spotting of TSB alone as a negative control did not cause inhibition . 
Thus , all further agar spot bioassays were performed by the deferred method . 
By the deferred method , all Pseudomonas strains were screened for the inhibition of ﬁve serovars of S. enterica on three different agar media ( LA , PAF , and MA ) . 
Only P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and some of its derivative strains gave clear zones of inhibition . 
The data for these strains are presented in Table 2 . 
The degree of antibiosis observed was dependent on the agar media type and the particular S. enterica serovar tested . 
The results presented are for readings taken 24 h after overlaying the plates with the indicator strains , as no signiﬁcant changes in inhibition were noted after an additional 24 h of incubation . 
Strain P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and its derivatives 2-79 LacZ ( deﬁcient in phenazine production ) and 2-79 .59.34 ( deﬁcient in siderophore production ) showed the greatest degree of antagonism . 
For these strains , the most consistent inhibition occurred after growth on LA , and the most susceptible indicator strain was S. enterica serovar Anatum . 
The addition of glucose ( 2 % ) to LA reduced inhibition slightly . 
The addition of FeCl3 ( 100 mM ) to LA also caused a slight reduction in inhibition , but the addition of FeCl3 to PAF caused an increase in inhibition ( Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , the two P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 derivatives with mutations for the production of GacS ( 2-79 .59.34.24 and 2-79B46 ) demonstrated little-to-no activity . 
Buffering LA by the presence of 100 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer ( ﬁnal media pH of 6.8 ) had no effect on the antibiosis exhibited by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 against S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 ( data not shown ) . 
When clear zones of inhibition were produced by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 , 2-79LacZ , and 2-79 .59.34 , a few isolated colonies of S. enterica were always evident in the inhibition zones after 24 to 48 h of incubation . 
Representative colo-nies were picked from the clear inhibition zones , puriﬁed by single-colony cloning three times on agar media , and then subjected to biochemical reactions with a BBL Enter-otube II ( BBL , Becton Dickinson ) and Gram-Negative Identiﬁcation cards of the Vitek AMS Automicrobic system

All of the apparent resistant colonies tested were conﬁrmed to be Salmonella by these three methods . 
When four of the apparent resistant variants of Salmonella were retested as indicator strains with P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 as the producer strain , no zones of inhibition were noted , which conﬁrmed the resistance of these isolates to the antimicrobial compound ( s ) produced . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 did not give inhibition zones when tested against itself as the indicator strain after growth on LA for 48 h before overlaying . 
Sensitivity to PCA . 
S. enterica serovar Anatum F4317 was not inhibited by the presence of PCA at up to 100 mg per disk . 
The presence of PCA at 13 mg per disk or greater resulted in hazy zones of inhibition when tested against the sensitive control strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens .

terial agent ( s ) was not transferred from the clear inhibition zones ( produced by growing P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 on LA for 48 h and overlaying it with S. enterica serovar Stanley H0558 as the indicator strain ) to freshly prepared lawns of the same indicator strain by either method tested .

The GacS mutant P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 B46 gave mixed results , with turbid zones of inhibition evident for the ﬁrst experiment and small clear zones ( 2.0 cm from the edge of the wells for both experiments ) for the second experiment . 
A few isolated colonies of the indicator strain were evident in all clear zones of inhibition by 24 h of incubation . 
No change in the appearance of inhibition zones occurred between 24 and 48 h of incubation , except for an increase in the size of the apparent resistant colonies . 
The heating of cell-free supernatant ﬂuids of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 in a boiling water bath for 10 min before testing did not reduce the size or eliminate the zones of inhibition . 
No inhibition was noted when P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was used both for the production of cell-free supernatant ﬂuids and as the indicator strain . 
The growth of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 in LB for 48 h caused an increase in pH from an initial value of 6.8 to a ﬁnal value of 8.6 . 
scens 2-79 and its derivative strains 2-79LacZ , 2-79 .59.34 , 2-79 .59.34.24 , and 2-79B46 all exhibited equal growth in TSB , increasing in population by approximately 1 log CFU / ml at 6 h and by approximately 5 log CFU/ml at 24 h to a ﬁnal population of approximately 10 log CFU/ml ( data not shown ) . 
No change in media pH occurred after the growth of strain 2-79 alone for 24 h . 
The results for the growth of a bacterial cocktail consisting of ﬁve S. enterica strains in the presence of strain 2-79 and its derivatives are shown in Figure 1 . 
No reduction in the population of S. enterica at 6 h of incubation was noted during coculture with any of the strains tested . 
However , population reductions were noted for S. enterica at 24 h. For the control , the cocktail of S. enterica strains reached approximately 10 log CFU/ml at 24 h , but in the presence of the pseudomonads , the ﬁnal populations of S. enterica ranged from approximately 4 to 9 log CFU/ml . 
The ﬁnal populations of S. enterica in the presence of strain 2-79 and its derivatives were signiﬁcantly less than for the control , except for derivative strain 2-79 .59.34.24 . 
The mean log reductions of S. enterica at 24 h were greatest for strains 2-79 and 2-79LacZ ( 5.60 6 0.66 and 4.40 6 0.15 log CFU/ml , respectively ) . 
comparing the growth of the parent and the antibiotic-re-sistant derivatives of the four S. enterica serovars in TSB or TSB supplemented with antibiotics with incubation at 378C ( 250 rpm ) , as appropriate , indicated that the derivatives had longer generation times ( an average of 0.32 6 0.04 h for the derivatives versus an average of 0.19 6 0.00 h for the parent strains ) . 
Each of the individual cultures of the antibiotic-resistant derivatives of the four S. enterica a The population of the cocktail of Salmonella enterica strains on sprouts grown from seed not treated with an antagonist averaged 6.50 log CFU/g ( range , 5.75 to 7.62 log CFU/g ) .

serovars used to prepare the cocktail and to inoculate the seed contained approximately 9.6 log CFU/ml . 
After inoculation and drying , populations of S. enterica on the inoculated seed were determined to be 3.9 log CFU/g , on the basis of plating on the selective agar medium XLT-4 , and 4.4 log CFU/g , on the basis of plating on TSASN . 
From the data obtained with TSASN and assuming that there are ca. 500 seeds per g of alfalfa seed , the average inoculum load per seed was approximately 50 CFU . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 and its derivatives 2-79LacZ and 2-79 .59.34 were the most effective inhibitors of the growth of the cocktail of S. enterica serovars on sprouting alfalfa seed , averaging reductions of 4 to 5 log CFU/g at day 6 ( Table 3 ) . 
Sprouts grown from contaminated seed treated with these strains appeared normal , and fresh weights of the harvested sprouts grown from treated seed were similar to the controls ( data not shown ) . 
Treatment with P. ﬂuo-rescens 2-79B46 was less effective , resulting in an average reduction of 1.2 log CFU/g , whereas treatment with deriv-ative 2-79 .59.34.24 resulted in no control of S. enterica growth in two of the three experiments , with an average reduction for the three experiments of only 0.33 log CFU / g . 
The other pseudomonads tested were also ineffective antagonists of S. enterica , and several were inhibitory toward seed germination and subsequent sprout growth . 
Time course experiments demonstrated an increase of approximately 3 log CFU/g for the four-strain cocktail of S. enterica within the ﬁrst 24 h of sprouting for the untreated control ( Fig. 2 ) . 
For the remainder of the 6-day sprouting period , the populations of S. enterica on the control sprouts remained stable . 
In the presence of strain 2-79 , populations of S. enterica did not increase during the 6-day sprouting period , and populations were signiﬁcantly lower ( P , 0.05 ) than populations of Salmonella in the absence of strain 2-79 on days 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In this set of experiments , the average log reduction at day 6 was approximately 4 log CFU/g .

DISCUSSION
The use of native microﬂora as biological control agents to control the survival and growth of bacterial human pathogens on alfalfa sprouts may be an alternative to , or may be applied after , chemical and physical interventions , such as the currently recommended seed soak in 20,000 ppm of chlorine ( 50 ) , to further decrease the risk of illness due to contaminated sprouts . 
When screening the wild-type strains for antibiosis against Salmonella on agar media , P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 demonstrated the highest degree of antibiosis against S. enterica . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 has been studied for many years as a biological control agent because of its ability to control the plant disease take-all of wheat caused by the fungus G. graminis var . 
tritici . 
The bacterium produces the antifungal compounds PCA and pyoverdine ( an iron-binding siderophore ) , with the production of PCA playing the predominant role in controlling take-all disease ( 10 , 13 , 31 , 48 ) . 
The additional ﬂuorescent pseudomonads P. aureofaciens 30-84 and ATCC 13985 ( also producers of PCA ) -- as well as P. ﬂuorescens Pf-5 , CHA0 , Q2-87 , and Q8r1-96 ( producers of antifungal compounds , including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol , pyoluteorin , pyrrolnitrin , and hydrogen cyanide ) ( 28 , 34 , 36 , 53 ) -- were not inhibitory toward Salmonella in the agar spot bioassays . 
Of these strains , all but P. aureofaciens ATCC 13985 have been reported to be biological control agents with activity against various soilborne plant fungal diseases ( 36 ) . 
In addition to the results of the agar spot bioassays , the results of both the coculture experiments performed in broth and the assays for antibacterial activity of cell-free supernatant ﬂuids indicate that P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 produces a diffusible antibacterial substance ( s ) inhibitory toward S. enterica . 
The nature of the antibacterial substance ( s ) produced by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 that is inhibitory toward Sal-monella is not known . 
Whatever the nature of the substance ( s ) , P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 appears resistant to its anti-microbial effects . 
Several observations indicate that the production of the iron-binding ﬂuorescent siderophore ( pyoverdine ) by strain P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was not responsible for antibacterial activity . 
First , growth on the low-iron medium PAF ( a medium that favors the production of sid-erophore ( 21 ) ) did not favor antibiosis . 
Second , the addition of iron to PAF led to an increase , rather than a decrease , in antibiosis . 
Third , the siderophore-deﬁcient derivative P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 .59.34 was not compromised in antibiosis , as demonstrated in both in vitro and in situ bioassays . 
This is in contrast to the results of two earlier studies , which indicated a role for siderophore production in the inhibition of growth of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica subsp . 
arizoniae on agar media by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas chlororaphis ( 9 , 22 ) . 
The production of PCA also does not appear to be responsible for the antibiosis exhibited by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 against S. enterica . 
The PCA-deﬁcient derivative P. ﬂuo-rescens 2-79LacZ was not reduced in activity in vitro or in situ , and puriﬁed PCA did not inhibit the growth of S. enterica serovar Anatum F4317 when tested at up to 100 mg in the disk diffusion assay . 
In addition , the other PCA-pro-ducing bacteria P. aureofaciens 30-84 and ATCC 13985 tested were not effective antagonists either in vitro or in situ . 
The in vitro inhibitory activity of PCA has been reported to be greater against fungi than against bacteria ( 10 ) . 
The antibacterial substance ( s ) produced by P. ﬂuore-scens 2-79 that is inhibitory toward the growth of S. enterica appears to be under the regulatory control of the two-component system GacS-GacA , as evidenced by the lack of signiﬁcant in vitro and in situ activity of the two GacS mutants tested ( P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 .59.34.24 and 2-79B46 ) . 
GacS is the sensor kinase , and GacA is the response regulator of a two-component regulatory system that exerts a positive effect on the production of a variety of extracellular metabolites ( 12 ) . 
Pseudomonas spp . 
with mutations in the gacS-gacA regulatory region are deﬁcient in the production of antibiotics as well as extracellular enzymes , including proteases and lipases , and are ineffective in plant disease control ( 11 , 12 ) . 
Because of the absence of an inhibitory effect of heat treatments , the antibiosis exhibited by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 also does not appear to be the result of the production of proteases , lipases , or heat-labile bacteriocins . 
The involvement of bacteriophages appears unlikely because of the inability to transfer the antibacterial substance ( s ) from clear zones of inhibition to freshly prepared lawns of a susceptible indicator strain by two different methods . 
Localized acidiﬁcation of the media by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 was not involved in antibiosis , as evidenced by no effect of buff-ering of LA in the agar spot bioassay study . 
The addition of iron and glucose to the high-iron-containing medium LA reduced the level of antibiosis , whereas the addition of iron to the iron-deﬁcient medium PAF increased antibiosis . 
Iron may be required in moderate amounts for the optimal production or activity of the active metabolite ( s ) but , above a certain level , may also be inhibitory . 
Increases in the production of antifungal metabolites by the addition of iron and glucose to the growth medium have been reported for ﬂuorescent pseudomonads ( 6 , 37 , 40 , 48 , 52 , 53 ) . 
The growth dynamics of the cocktail of S. enterica strains during the sprouting of untreated seed were similar to those previously reported for laboratory-inoculated alfalfa seed ( 14 , 19 ) . 
The relative efﬁcacy of the ﬂuorescent pseudomonads as antagonists during the sprouting process correlated well with the results of the agar spot bioassays ( deferred method ) carried out on LA for all bacterial strains , with the exception of P. chlororaphis ATCC 9446 . 
This strain demonstrated a greater degree of antagonism in situ than would have been predicted by the in vitro bioassay results . 
P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 , 2-79 .59.34 ( deﬁcient in pyov-erdine ) , and 2-79LacZ ( deﬁcient in PCA ) were all effective inhibitors of S. enterica outgrowth in situ , and no detrimental effects on seed germination or sprout yield and appearance were observed for the wild-type strain , which corresponds to the results reported by Matos and Garland ( 25 ) for P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 . 
The lack of soft-rot symptoms on sprouts grown from treated seed is in agreement with the nonpectolytic nature of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 . 
The observation that P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 is an effective biological control strain against Salmonella on sprouting alfalfa seed con-ﬁrms the results of a recent study by Matos and Garland ( 25 ) . 
However , the drop-off in efﬁcacy in the control of Salmonella outgrowth between days 3 and 7 of sprouting that they reported was not observed through day 6 of the sprouting process in our experiments . 
The overall level of Salmonella on alfalfa seed in naturally contaminated lots is usually less than 2 per 100 g of seed by the most-probable-number technique ( 16 ) , which is several orders of magnitude lower than that used in our bioassays ( initial population , 4.4 log CFU/g ) . 
However , prior results in our laboratory on the dose of gamma irradiation required to kill S. enterica in a naturally contaminated seed lot indicated that the population on an individual contaminated seed may reach a level of 4 log CFU ( 45 ) . 
That P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 strongly inhibited outgrowth of the initial high populations of S. enterica present on the seed in our study demonstrates the potential of this strain as a biological control agent under very stringent experimental conditions . 
The current study and the previous study of Matos and Garland ( 25 ) indicate that biological control may be a viable intervention for controlling S. enterica outgrowth from contaminated seed during the sprouting process . 
Matos and Garland ( 25 ) reported good control of S. enterica outgrowth on sprouting alfalfa seed , not only by P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 at days 1 and 3 of sprouting ( reductions of 4 log CFU/g ) but also by undeﬁned whole microbial communities isolated from market sprouts ( a reduction greater than 5 log CFU / g at day 7 ) . 
Fluorescent pseudomonads have previously been reported to inhibit the growth of bacterial human pathogens on plant surfaces . 
The saprophyte Pseudomonas syringae inhibited the growth of E. coli O157 : H7 inoculated into wounds of apple fruit ( 17 ) . 
Two ﬂuorescent pseudomonads isolated from the leaves of endive signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on endive leaves when inoculated prior to the pathogen ( 4 ) . 
A ﬂuorescent pseudomonad in combination with a yeast , when coinoculated onto pepper disks , inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes ( 24 ) . 
Further research to identify the heat-stable extracellular antibacterial metabolite ( s ) responsible for the antibiosis of P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 against S. enterica is currently under way . 
Identiﬁcation of the mechanism ( s ) of antibiosis may allow the generation of more effective mutants by genetic manipulation . 
Because of the occurrence of a naturally occurring resistant subpopulation of S. enterica , as demonstrated in this study , P. ﬂuorescens 2-79 might be best used in a mixture of biological control agents with differing modes of action . 
Future studies will focus on larger-scale experiments testing strain 2-79 for the control of pathogen outgrowth from contaminated seed under conditions that more closely mimic commercial production ( e.g. , frequent overhead watering ) .
