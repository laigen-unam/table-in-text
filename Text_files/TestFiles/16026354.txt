Distance between gene and closest marker ( RH map units ) with two-point analysis . 
obtained from rodent genomic DNA . 
Vectors of ampliﬁcation results were submitted to the IMpRH Server ( http://imprh . 
toulouse.inra.fr / ) . 
The RH mapping data are summarized in 6 Table 2 . 
Comments : The human CACNA2D1 gene is located on HSA7q21 -- q22 , CACNB1 on HSA17q21 -- q22 and CACNG1 on HSA17q24 . 
The mapping of CACNA2D1 to SSC9 is consistent with known conservation between SSC9 and HSA7 . 
Similarly , assignment of CACNB1 and CACNG1 to SSC12 is consistent with the known conservation between SSC12 and HSA17 ( INRA human -- pig http://www.touluse.inra.fr/lgc/pig/compare ) . 
Primer sequences and PCR conditions : The PCR primers and spe-ciﬁc ampliﬁcation conditions are listed in Table 1 for eight of these ten genes . 
All PCR was performed in a 10-ll reaction volume of 1X PCR buffer , 1.5 mM MgCl , 0.5 lM of each primer , 2 200 lM dNTP , 2 U Taq polymerase , and 10 ng of genomic DNA of the porcine somatic cell hybrid panel ( SCHP ) or the full 1 INRA-University of Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid ( IMp-RH ) panel . 
The PCR reaction was pre-heated at 94 C for 2,3 3 min , then followed by 31 -- 40 cycles at 94 C for 30 s , 51 --

Physical mapping of eight pig genes whose expression level is acutely affected by Salmonella challenge
within the mesenteric lymph nodes of swine during infection with Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis ( J. J. Uthe , T. J. Stabel , S. H. Zhao , C. K. Tuggle , S. M. D. Bearson , submitted ) . 
Seven genes increased and two decreased their expression levels within 24 or 48 h post-infection , and were identiﬁed using suppression subtractive hybridization ( SSH ) . 
As several heat-shock protein genes were identiﬁed by SSH , an additional heat-shock gene family member ( HSPA1A ) was also tested and found to respond to infection as well ( J. J. Uthe , 
T. J. Stabel , S. H. Zhao , C. K. Tuggle , S. M. D. Bearson , submitted ) . 
65 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s and completed at 72 C for 5 min . 
Unique PCR products were conﬁrmed by 3 % agarose gel electrophoresis . 
In all cases , primers of these genes only ampli-ﬁed pig genomic DNA , and not mouse or hamster controls . 
Chromosomal localizations : All genes were physically assigned with the SCHP using software at the INRA web site ( http : / / www.toulouse.inra.fr/lgc/pig/hybrid.htm ) . 
The genes were also typed in duplicate with the IMpRH panel . 
If a discrepancy occurred between the ﬁrst and second tests , a third test was performed . 
Two-point results were calculated and multipoint radiation hybrid ( RH ) maps were built with IMpRH server ( http : / / imprh.toulouse.inra.fr / ) . 
Linkage groups were assigned using a minimum LOD score threshold of 5.0 . 
The eight genes associated with Salmonella infection were located to six porcine chromosomes . 
The known human and developed porcine positions are listed in Table 1 . 
The retention fraction for each gene in the RH panel and the locus with the highest two-point LOD score for each gene are also shown in Table 1 ; chromosomal band location listed under RH data for each gene was estimated based on closest ﬂanking markers with cytogenetic mapping information . 
The mapping data for seven genes ( HSPA1A , HSPCA , HSPH1 , CXCR4 , CXCL10 , SDCBP and ANXA5 ) were consistent between

The exception to this rule , GNB2L1 , was localized to SSC2p11 -- p13 by SCHP , but to SSC2q21 -- q24 using IMpRH typing and ﬂanking marker data . 
These two different regions are separated by just one clone in the SCHP analysis , so we favour the RH map data . 
In addition , the RH map data clariﬁed the location for two genes .

Figure 1 SDCBP and CXCL10 map near quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) for immune traits . 
At the left in each group is shown the available MARC linkage map ( http://www.marc.usda.gov/genome/genome.html ) . 
In the middle current radiation hybrid maps are shown including newly mapped genes . 
At the right , the approximate position of the immune trait QTL is shown . 
Selected loci are shown to delineate comparative maps of human chromosomes 1 ( HSA1 ) , 4 ( HSA4 ) , 8 ( HSA8 ) and pig chromosomes 4 ( SSC4 ) and 8 ( SSC8 ) . 
SSC7q12 -- q23 or SSC7q26 by SCHP . 
HSPA1A and HSPCA are 4 both positioned to two regions of SSC7 ( 7q12 -- q23 or 7q26 ) using the SCHP data . 
Based on a combination of IMpRH results and cytogenetic position of ﬂanking markers , HSPA1A is assigned on SSC7q12 -- q23 and HSPCA is located on SSC7q26 . 
Further , CXCL10 has been mapped by linkage to SSC8 between S0017 and S0086 at 64 cM . 
Our RH mapping places CXCL10 in nearly 5 the same location , but distal to S0086 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
We favour our location for CXCL10 because the calculated maximum likelihood for the multipoint order with CXCL10 in this position ( ) 147.3 ) was much higher than that calculated for the order with CXCL10 between S0017 and S0086 ( ) 155.6 ) .

Comments : Disease resistance has genetic heritability , and the mapping of genes involved in natural resistance ( innate immunity ) has been reported . 
Quantitative trait loci for 6,7 immune parameters have been identiﬁed in outbred pig populations , and studies on quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) for immune 8 capacity traits have reported stress-induced alterations in por-cine leucocyte numbers and functions . 
SDCBP may be a 9 candidate gene for a QTL controlling mitogen-induced proliferation of whole blood cells , which has been mapped at ATP1B1 on SSC4q13 -- q21 . 
On the linkage map used in the 8 QTL study , the QTL maximum at ATP1B1 was most closely ﬂanked by S0107 and GBA over a 17 cM region ; we mapped SDCBP between S0107 and SW1089 , within the QTL peak region ( Fig. 1 ) . 
An improved linkage map and RH map for SSC4 indicates this region is approximately 25 cM in size . 
Another 10 such candidate can be proposed through the localization of CXCL10 in this study near a QTL that affects the number of lymphocytes following mixing and transport of pigs ; both are 9 located on SSC8q11 -- q12 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The CXCL10 gene , which in pig was shown to increase expression after Salmonella infection ( J. J. Uthe , T. J. Stabel , S. H. Zhao , C. K. Tuggle , S. M. D. Bearson , submitted ) , could play a role in the QTL located on 
SSC8q11 -- q12 , because CXCL10 expression has been shown to increase lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen in vitro .

Source/description : The acid labile subunit ( ALS ) is an 85-kDa glycoprotein expressed primarily in the liver under growth hormone stimulation and distributed in the circulation . 
ALS , 1,2 insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs ) and IGF-binding protein ( IGFBP ) -3 or IGFBP-5 assemble into a ternary complex , which modulates the stability of IGFs and prolongs its biological half-life , and prevents cross-endothelial transport of IGFs in the circulation . 
Because of the regulatory role of IGFs in development 3 and growth , the maintenance of ALS is required for normal growth . 
ALS-and IGF-1-deﬁcient mice show retarded growth , 4 and serum ALS levels increased in girls with central precocious puberty , who are characterized as having enhanced growth velocity and early puberty . 
Furthermore , the dysfunction of 5 ALS has been implicated in a subtle impairment of linear growth , a delay in the onset and slow progress of puberty in a 17-year-old boy . 
As part of our efforts to characterize the gene 6 coding for ALS in pigs and its potential association with puberty , we mapped this gene using a porcine radiation hybrid panel . 
Primer design : A 442-bp porcine ALS mRNA ( GenBank accession no . 
AF218917 ) was used to design PCR primers ( forward : 5 cents - CAG CCT GGC GGC CCA TAC C-3 cents and reverse : 5 cents - GAG CTT GGG CGG CTT GAC G-3 cents ) amplifying a partial last exon . 
The 330-bp ampliﬁed fragment was puriﬁed with the QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and sequenced with the PCR primers using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit ( version 3.1 ) and TM an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyser ( Applied Biosystems , 
Foster City , CA , USA ) to verify its identity ( GenBank accession no . 
AF218917 ) . 
Radiation hybrid panel analyses : The porcine ALS primers were typed on the INRA/University of Minnesota porcine radiation 6 hybrid panel ( IMpRH7000 ) . 
PCR reactions were carried out with hybrid DNA ( 90 clones ) , porcine genomic DNA ( positive control ) and hamster DNA ( parallel control ) . 
A total of 13 ng genomic DNA was ampliﬁed in a total volume of 25 ll containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 1.4 mM DMSO , 100 lM of each dNTP , 10 pmol of each primer , 1.5 U Taq polymerase and 1X PCR buffer ( Sangon , Shanghai , China ) . 
PCR conditions were 
94 C for 3 min , 33 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 67.8 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s , with a ﬁnal extension at 72 C for 7 min . 
All PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining . 
Chromosomal location : The retention frequency of the ALS gene was 42 % .
