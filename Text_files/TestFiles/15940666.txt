CD1d-restricted natural killer T ( NKT ) cells belong to the innate-like lymphocytes which respond rapidly to stress and infectious challenge . 
We have studied murine CD1d-restricted NKT cells in the early immune response to virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium after oral infection . 
In the liver and spleen , neutrophil and macrophage numbers had increased several-fold by day 5 post-infection , while the frequency of B and T lymphocytes decreased . 
These cellular changes occurred independently of CD1d-restricted NKT cells , and further , CD1d-restricted T cells did not influence the bacterial load . 
However , in CD1d + mice NK1 .1 + T cells and invariant CD1d-restricted T cells were activated by the infection , as demonstrated by an increase in size , up-regulation of CD69 and production of IFN-c . 
The NK1 .1 antigen was down-modulated on these cells during the course of infection , while TCR levels were unaffected . 
While dendritic cells ( DC ) upregulated CD1d-levels upon 24 h of in vitro exposure to the bacteria , increased CD1d expression was not evident on DC in vivo during infection . 
Furthermore , in vitro re-stimulation of CD1d-restricted T cells isolated from infected mice demonstrated a significant skewing of the cytokine profile , with suppressed IL-4 and increased IFN-c production .

Introduction
CD1d-restricted natural killer T ( NKT ) cells belong to the innate lymphocytes which respond rapidly to stress and infectious challenge [ 1 ] . 
CD1d-restricted NKT cells play a role in infections with different types of pathogens including bacteria [ 2 -- 9 ] . 
Several models demonstrate an important contribution by NKT cells to the immune defense and clearance of the pathogen , while NKT cells

Thus , the role of NKT cells in infections is complex , and differs for distinct pathogens . 
Upon activation in vitro and in vivo , NKT cells rapidly produce an array of cytokines [ 10 ] and can influence both the innate and adaptive immune response [ 11 , 12 ] . 
Recent data suggest that CD1d-restricted NKT cells can be divided into two functionally different subsets , distinguished by TCR and surface markers , as well as cytokine production [ 13 -- 15 ] . 
Invariant NKT cells using the conserved TCR Va14-Ja281 rearrangement are major producers of IL-4 , and also make IFN-c , while NKT cells with diverse TCR are less efficient at secreting IL-4 but make large amounts of IFN-c . 
The former

Early cytokine secretion by NKT cells has consequences during infection . 
Absence of CD1d-restricted NKT cells resulted in the reduced recruitment of neutrophils to infected lungs hours after pathogen inoculation [ 8 , 9 ] , supporting the view that NKT cells may exert their function by prompt activation and cytokine expression . 
However , the natural activation , role and effects in vivo of NKT cells during infections is still poorly understood despite the relatively detailed knowledge on NKT cell activation and function in vitro . 
Salmonella is a facultative intracellular Gramnegative bacterium which naturally infects a host by the oral route . 
Infection with the human pathogen Salmonella typhi can result in a systemic infection , typhoid fever . 
Infection of mice with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) results in a systemic infection resembling the human disease and is used as a small animal model for typhoid fever pathogenesis [ 16 ] . 
Upon oral infection the bacteria cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and reside in the mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLN ) , liver and spleen , of which the two latter organs have significant populations of NKT cells which may contribute to the immune response against the pathogen . 
While IFN-c is central to resolving Salmonella infection , IL-4 can contribute to organ pathology in Salmonella-infected mice [ 16 ] . 
These observations suggest that NKT cells , which are potent producers of both IFN-c and IL-4 , may influence the host response to this pathogen . 
Indeed , NKT cells are activated after infection with Salmonella [ 5 , 17 , 18 ] , but their role during Salmonella infection is presently not known . 
The present study further explores the oral infection model with virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 17 ] to examine the role of CD1d-restricted NKT cells during the early stages of infection . 
Exponential growth of the bacteria also in wild-type C57BL/6 ( B6 ) mice allows the analysis of events during the first 5 -- 6 days of infection , while from around day 7 mice start to succumb to the infection , precluding the study of late events . 
We demonstrate prompt activation and IFN-c production by CD1d-restricted NKT cells in response to the infection , together with a strong skewing of the NKT cell cytokine profile . 
Dendritic cells ( DC ) up-regulated CD1d within 24 h of bacterial encounter in vitro , in contrast , a general increase of CD1d-levels on DC in vivo during infection was not observed . 
Pathogen spread correlated with the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the liver and spleen of infected animals , however , the absence of CD1d-restricted T cells did not influence these cellular changes , or alter bacterial load . 
These data suggest that , despite their activation , CD1d-restricted NKT cells do not have a major impact on the immune response during the early stages of oral infection with virulent S. typhimurium . 
Results
NKT cells and invariant CD1d-restricted T cells were activated by Salmonella infection
After infection with S. typhimurium , the frequency of NKT ( NK1 .1 + and TCRb + ) cells decreased from day 0 to day 5 in both spleen , as previously shown [ 17 ] , and liver ( Fig. 1A , white bars , and B , upper plots ) . 
NKT cells can down modulate the expression of the NK1 .1 marker upon activation [ 19 ] , suggesting that the cells in the infected mice may persist but escape detection relying on the NK1 .1 marker . 
Invariant CD1d-restricted cells can be identified using a CD1d-tetramer loaded with the synthetic ligand a-galactosylceramide ( aGalCer ) ( aGC-CD1d-tet ) [ 20 ] . 
Day 5 post-infection the frequency of aGC-CD1d-tet + cells had decreased somewhat in the liver but not in the spleen ( Fig. 1A , black bars , and B , lower plots ) , while the absolute numbers of aGC-CD1d-tet + cells remained fairly constant . 
There was a substantial down regulation of the NK1 .1 marker on aGC-CD1d-tet + cells in both tissues ( Fig. 1B , C ) , suggesting that some of the observed decrease of the NKT cell population could be caused by down regulation of this marker . 
In contrast , the TCR levels , indicated by the intensity of staining with the aGC-CD1d-tet , were not observed to decrease . 
Activation was indicated by increase in forward light scatter ( FSC ) , and up-regulation of CD69 expression on aGC-CD1d-tet + cells and NK cells in the spleen and MLN ( Fig. 1D , E ) . 
Thus , CD1d-restricted T cells were activated in MLN , spleen and liver at an early stage of oral S. typhimurium infection . 
Dendritic cells up-regulated CD1d expression upon infection with S. typhimurium in vitro but not in vivo
Up-regulation of CD1d on APC by the infection might contribute to the activation of CD1d-restricted NKT cells . 
To examine the direct effect of the bacteria on DC , bone marrow derived DC were infected in vitro with S. typhimurium and examined for CD1d-expression ( Fig. 2A , upper row ) . 
A range of DC : bacteria ratios resulted in a two - to threefold up-regulation of CD1d levels . 
Addition of higher numbers of bacteria resulted in reduced viability of the DC ( not shown ) . 
Treatment of DC with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a constitu-ent of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria which activates DC , induced a similar increase in CD1dexpression ( Fig. 2A , lower panels ) . 
IFN-c , which is produced early during the infection , did not influence CD1d levels . 
However , we did not observe a general increase in CD1d expression on splenic CD8a + or CD8a -- DC when analyzed at days 1 to 3 ( Fig. 2B ) and day 5 ( not shown ) post-infection , nor on hepatic DC on days 3 and 5 ( not shown ) .

Salmonella infection induced IFN-c production b NK , NKT and invariant CD1d-restricted cells 
To investigate cytokine production induced during infection in vivo , cells were prepared from infected mice and analyzed without further stimulation . 
At day 3 of infection , IFN-c production was seen in splenocytes from the majority of mice , and both NK and NK1 .1 + TCRb + cells containing IFN-c were readily observed ( Fig. 3A ) . 
NKT cells made up 24 16 % of total IFN-c-positive cells , while 17 4.5 % were T cells and 36 7.9 % NK cells ( n = 5 ) . 
At earlier times , days 1 and 2 post-infection , IFN-c-producing aGC-CD1d-tet + cells and NK cells were infrequently observed ( Fig. 3B ) , while positive cells of both types were present in most mice at day 3 ( Fig. 3A -- C ) . 
In mice with detectable IFN-c production , around 10 % of the positive cells were aGC-CD1d-tet + . 
IFN-c production was also clearly demonstrated in liver-derived cells in seven of eight mice at day 5 ( Fig. 3C ) . 
aGC-CD1d-tet + cells made up 16 14 % of total IFN-c containing hepatic cells ( n = 5 ) . 
IL-4 producing-NKT cells were not detected at the times tested ( not shown ) . 
CD1d-restricted T cells did not affect bacterial load in infected hosts
To determine whether the presence of CD1d-restricted T cells influenced the bacterial load , CFU were measured in MLN , spleen and liver after oral inoculation with the bacteria ( Fig. 4 ) . 
No difference in bacterial counts in these organs could be detected between B6 , CD1d + / -- and CD1d -- / -- mice , showing that CD1d-restricted NKT cells did not have a significant effect on the ability of the mice to control bacterial growth up to day 5 post-infection .

The same results were obtained at day 5 post-infection ( not shown ) . 
Data are representative of at least four mice . 
The dynamic alterations of immune cell populations in response to infection were retained in CD1d-deficient mice
CD1d-restricted T cells cause an early recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissue in response to challenge with Pseudomonas [ 8 ] or S. pneumoniae [ 9 ] . 
During oral Salmonella infection , neutrophils as well as macrophage numbers increase in the spleen [ 17 ] . 
To determine whether CD1d-restricted T cells influenced the population dynamics in response to Salmonella , frequencies of macrophages , neutrophils , NK , B and T cells were + / -- -- / -- compared between CD1d and CD1d mice after + / -- infection ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The spleen of CD1d mice had a prominent accumulation of macrophages and , in particular , neutrophils resulting in a several-fold increase in the frequency of these cells from day 0 to day 5 . 
In contrast , NK and T cell populations were reduced during this time . 
Infected CD1d-deficient mice demonstrated very similar changes in splenic cell populations . 
The changes reflect alterations in actual cell numbers as the total number of splenocytes was constant during infection . 
y 
The most dynamic cellular changes occurred in the livers of infected mice . 
In CD1d + / -- mice , the macro-phage population expanded from around 10 % to over 40 % at day 5 , while 10 -- 15 % of the cells were neutrophils at this time compared to 3 -- 4 % before infection . 
A striking reduction in the fraction of hepatic B and T cells was detected ( Fig 5 ) . 
Total cell numbers increased three fold in the liver by day 5 of infection , thus , there was little change in the actual numbers of B , T and invariant CD1d-restricted cells ( Figs. 5 and 1A ) , while the absolute numbers of neutrophils and macro-phages were increased up to 20-fold . 
The infection caused rather small relative changes in the MLN populations . 
The absence of CD1d-restricted T cells did not affect the infection-induced alterations in the analyzed cell populations , nor the total cell numbers per organ . 
Salmonella infection skewed the cytokine production of CD1d-restricted NKT cells
Despite the well-documented secretion of IL-4 by activated NKT cells in vitro and in vivo [ 10 ] , we found that NKT cells synthesized IFN-c but not IL-4 in response to the infection ( see section `` Salmonella infection induced IFN-c production ... '' ) . 
This suggested that the inflammatory environment brought about by the infection , such as exposure to IL-12 [ 21 , 22 ] , influenced the ability of NKT cells to produce cytokines . 
We tested whether the skewed cytokine profile could be reversed in vitro by activating NKT cells from infected mice with PMA and ionomycin . 
While 50 % of splenic NKT cells from uninfected CD1d + / -- mice were induced in vitro to produce IFN-c , this had increased to close to 80 % at day 5 post-infection ( Fig. 6A ) . 
In contrast , the proportion of the cells that synthesized IL-4 decreased from

In NK1 .1 + T cells from CD1d -- - / -- mice very little IL-4 was detected at any time and their ability to make IFN-c was not altered by the infection . 
In contrast , IFN-c production by NK cells was augmented in both CD1d + / -- and CD1d -- / -- mice , while T cells from both mice were unaltered in this respect . 
This suggested that the infection resulted in an altered NKT cell cytokine production profile . 
Analysis of splenic aGC-CD1d-tet + cells at day 5 of infection , demonstrated similarly a maintained ability to make IFN-c , but a severely reduced IL-4 synthesis in response to in vitro activation ( Fig. 6B ,

Thus , oral Salmonella infection skewed the cytokine production profile of NKT cells from a IFN-c + IL-4 + to a IFN-c + profile in a CD1d-dependent manner . 
Discussion
We have investigated the role of CD1d-restricted NKT cells in the early immune response to oral infection with virulent Salmonella typhimurium . 
Previous studies have reported a rapid accumulation and activation of neutrophils and macrophages in the spleen after primary oral Salmonella infection , concomitant with a decline in NKT and NK cell populations . 
Both NK and NKT cells , however , were found to produce IFN-c in response to the bacterial challenge demonstrating that they were activated by the infection [ 17 ] . 
We have further investigated the early immune response and the fate of invariant CD1d-restricted T cells in the spleen and liver the first 5 days of infection . 
Invariant CD1d-restricted T cells were activated as demonstrated by an increased cell size , elevated CD69 expression and IFN-c production . 
The absolute number of aGC-CD1d-tet + cells was maintained in liver and spleen during this time . 
This is in agreement with recently published observations in the spleen after oral Salmonella infection [ 23 ] and in both organs after the bacteria were administered i. v. [ 24 ] . 
Strikingly , we show that the proportion of invariant CD1d-restricted cells that displayed the NK1 .1 marker cells was severely reduced from 65 -- 80 % positive cells before Salmonella inoculation to 5 -- 10 % on day 5 of infection . 
This suggests that NKT cells down modulate the NK1 .1 marker in response to the infection , supporting data of Wilson et al. [ 23 ] . 
Alternatively , the cells disappear concomitant to a recruitment or proliferation of NK1 .1 -- CD1d-restricted T cells over the first 5 days of infection . 
In contrast , TCR levels were not decreased during Salmonella induced NKT cell activation ( Fig. 1C ) . 
This is different from the severely reduced TCR levels found in response to the synthetic NKT cell agonist aGalCer [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] . 
Treatment of mice with this ligand reduces dramatically the expression of both NK1 .1 and the TCR . 
Our data suggest that natural in vivo activation of CD1d-restricted T cells may lead to reduced NK1 .1 expression but not necessarily to down modulation of the TCR . 
It is not clear whether CD1d-restricted T cells are naturally activated by TCR independent signals during infection , by pathogen-derived glycolipid ligands presented on CD1d , or if the cells in the context of infection/inflammation respond to CD1d displaying endogenous ligands . 
CD1d-restricted NKT cells show a degree of autoreactivity to endogenous CD1d [ 27 , 28 ] , however , the cells are not constitutively active in vivo . 
Thus , changes such as up-regulated CD1d-expression , enhanced co-stimulation and inflammatory signals may be essential components of CD1d-restricted T cell activation . 
We investigated the levels of CD1d on potential APC in response to Salmonella infection , and found that DC up-regulated CD1d after bacterial encounter in vitro . 
LPS treatment of DC in vitro had a similar effect on CD1d expression , confirming previous reports [ 29 , 30 ] . 
These findings suggest that pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMP ) such as LPS can make a significant contribution to the induction of CD1d-restricted T cells during infection . 
This is supported by the recent demonstration of a crucial role for TLR signaling in Salmonella-induced activation of invariant NKT cells in the presence of DC in vitro [ 31 ] . 
In these cultures , NKT cell stimulation appeared to require CD1d-dependent presentation of the endogen-ous glycosphingolipid ligand iGb3 . 
While we did not find a general increase in CD1d levels on DC subsets in vivo during the infection , we can not rule out up-regulated CD1d on a fraction of the DC . 
Brigl et al. [ 24 ] demonstrated that activation of NKT cells in response to i. v. Salmonella infection required CD1d-recognition . 
They further found that IL-12 , which was detected systemically early after infection , contributed to the NKT cell derived IFN-c production , suggesting that IL-12 may potentiate CD1d-restricted activation . 
We found that the entire NKT cell population was profoundly affected by the oral infection , as the ability to produce IL-4 was impaired 5 days after infection . 
Simultaneously , IFN-c production by NKT cells had increased at day 5 post-infection to over 80 % after polyclonal activation in vitro . 
This demonstrated a strong skewing of the NKT cell cytokine profile in response to the Salmonella infection , which was not reversed in vitro with the powerful mitogenic stimuli PMA and ionomycin . 
Several reports suggest that this skewing could result from exposure to IL-12 [ 21 , 22 , 24 ] . 
In contrast , variations in the protocol for aGC administration or the lack of costimulation or cytokine signaling was not able to polarize the cytokine pattern produced by invariant NKT cells in vivo [ 32 ] . 
In this model of oral infection with virulent S. typhimurium the lack of CD1d-restricted T cells did not appear to have dramatic consequences for the immediate immune response or for the spread of the infection , despite the early and efficient activation of CD1d-restricted T cells . 
However , we can not exclude an influence by the CD1d-mutation on other or more subtle infection induced events not measured in this study . 
Studies in which mice were infected intravenously or intraperitoneally with Salmonella have demonstrated various effects by NKT cells [ 5 , 6 , 18 ] , indicating that the cells would make a difference in the response to this bacterium . 
However , the virulence of the bacteria and the route of infection may play a role for the importance of CD1d-restricted cells . 
Alternatively , CD1d-restricted NKT cells are not important for the early immune response to oral Salmonella infection , while they play a role in the immediate response to other infections [ 2 , 8 , 9 , 33 ] . 
It is also possible that CD1d-restricted T cells could influence the later adaptive immunity to primary or secondary Salmonella challenge . 
The choice of bacteria did not allow us to address this question in the present experiments , due to the virulence of the resulting infection . 
Further studies are needed to clarify these issues . 
Materials and methods
Mice
The 11 - to 17-week-old B6 and CD1d -- / -- or + / -- mice backcrossed five generations onto B6 were used for the experiments . 
CD1d-deficient mice were generously provided by Dr. C.-R . 
Wang , Chicago [ 34 ] . 
Mice were bred and housed in a clean animal facility at Lund University . 
B6 mice express a susceptibility allele of the Nramp1 locus strongly determining bacterial growth and susceptibility to infection with S. typhimurium , while 129/sv mice ( the origin of the CD1d -- / -- mice ) express a dominant resistance allele [ 35 ] . 
Nramp1 is found on chromosome 1 , while the CD1d gene is encoded on chromosome 3 , making it unlikely that the 129/sv derived Nramp1 allele is maintained in the CD1d -- / -- mice at the fifth back-cross generation to B6 . 
Further , B6 mice were compared to CD1d + / -- mice for bacterial growth at days 3 and 5 after infection and no difference was found ( see Fig. 4 ) strongly suggesting that the Nramp1 locus of the CD1d -- / -- mice at the fifth back-cross harbor the B6 susceptibility allele . 
Bacteria and oral infection of mice
The virulent S. typhimurium strain v4666 was used in these studies and has been previously described [ 17 ] . 
Overnight cultures of bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertoni broth ( LB ) and incubated at 37 C with shaking . 
The concentration of bacteria was determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm , the bacteria were re-suspended in PBS at an appropriate concentration , and administered to the mice . 
The actual bacterial dose was determined by plating serial dilutions of the inoculum , and determining the number of CFU after overnight growth . 
Twenty minutes prior to intragastric inoculation mice were treated intragastrically with 100 ll of 1 % sodium bicarbonate . 
The actual oral dose ranged from 1.1 109 to 3.5 109 bacteria/mouse . 
Spleen , MLN , and liver were removed aseptically and the bacterial load was determined in each organ by plating serial dilutions of single-cell suspensions on LB agar plates . 
For in vitro infection of DC , a wild-type strain of Salmonella typhimurium ( 14028S ) was grown on Luria agar plates . 
After an overnight incubation at 37 C , a bacterial suspension was made in PBS . 
The bacteria were quantified spectrophotometrically , washed once in PBS and resuspended 9 to 10 bacteria/ml in supplemented RPMI without antibiotics . 
Cell preparations
Spleens , MLN , and livers were homogenized between microscope slides before passing the suspension through a cell strainer . 
A fraction of the cell preparations were used to determine the bacterial load , as described above . 
Liver lymphocytes were isolated by spinning the cells on a 80 / 
40 % Percoll gradient at 1,100 g for 20 min . 
Lymphocytes were collected at the 80/40 % Percoll interphase . 
DC were isolated from spleen by incubating finely segmented spleen for 20 min at 37 C with collagenase IV ( 1.6 mg/ml ) and DNase I ( 1 % ) ( Sigma-Aldrich , Stockholm , Sweden ) in serum-free tissue culture medium . 
The digested preparation was then homogenized into a single-cell suspension . 
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and in vitro stimulation and infection
For the preparation of bone marrow-derived DC , cells were cultured from bone marrow of B6 mice as described [ 36 , 37 ] . 
DC were harvested as nonadherent cells on day 7 of culture , and stimulated with either IFN-c ( 100 U/ml ; ImmunoKontact , Bioggio , Switzerland ) or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ; LPS from Escherichia coli 055 : B5 ; Sigma-Aldrich ) or with a combination of IFN-c ( 100 U/ml ) and LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) at 37 C for 24 h. For flow cytometry MHC class IIhigh DC were gated and analyzed for CD1d expression . 
For infection with bacteria , DC were grown and harvested on day 7 of culture as described above and washed twice to remove the antibiotics . 
The cells were resuspended in supplemented RPMI without antibiotics and 6 seeded in 24-well plates at 10 cells/well . 
Bacteria at different dilutions were added to the wells and the plates were centrifuged . 
After 2 h of co-incubation at 37 C , the cultures were washed four times . 
The cells were then resuspended in supplemented RPMI containing 50 lg/ml of gentamycin ( GibcoBRL ) and incubated at 37 C for another 22 h . 
The cells were subsequently used for flow cytometry . 
Flow cytometry
Before stainings , cells were incubated with Fc-block ( 2.4 G2 ) , and 7AAD was included in all surface stainings to exclude dead cells . 
Intracellular markers were detected after surface staining and fixation in 2 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . 
The samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a permeabilization buffer ( PBS , 0.5 % saponin , 1 % BSA , 0.1 % NaN3 ) before being stained with antibodies ( diluted in permeablization buffer ) to intracellular proteins . 
A FACS Calibur ( Becton Dickinson , CA , USA ) and CELL QuestTM software were used to acquire and analyze the FACS data . 
Macrophages and neutrophils and were defined as CD68highGr-1negative / low and CD68lowGr-1high , respectively , as previously described [ 17 ] . 
Antibodies and CD1d-multimers
The following FITC - , PE - , and allophycocyanin ( APC ) - con-jugated monoclonal antibodies were used : anti-IFN-c-FITC ( XMG1 .2 ) , rat IgG1-FITC isotype control ( R3 -- 34 ) , anti-CD19-FITC ( 1D3 ) , anti-NK1 .1 - PE ( PK136 ) , anti-GR1-PE ( RB6 -- 8C5 ) , anti-TCRb-APC ( H57 -- 597 ) , anti-IL-4-APC ( 11B11 ) , and rat IgG1-APC isotype control ( R3 -- 34 ) were purchased from BD PharMingen . 
Anti-CD68-FITC ( FA-11 ) was purchased from Serotec ( Oxford , UK ) . 
Antibodies to B220 ( RA3 .2 B2 ) , MHC class II ( M5/114 ) and CD1d ( 1B1 ) were purified and conjugated to FITC ( Sigma ) or Cy5 ( Amersham Life Sciences , UK ) according to the manufacturers instructions . 
PE-labeled 
CD1d-tetramers ( kindly provided by M. Kronenberg , USA [ 20 ] ) , or CD1d-dimers ( BD PharMingen ) loaded with aGalCer ( kindly provided by Kirin Brewery Co. , Gunma , Japan ) were used to detect invariant CD1d-restricted T lymphocytes . 
Unloaded CD1d-multimers were used as background controls . 
In vitro stimulation of spleen and liver lymphocytes
Cells were stimulated in vitro with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) in the presence of brefeldin A ( 10 lg / ml ) for 4 h at 37 C. Stimulation was carried out at 1 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco BRL ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 10 mM Hepes buffer , 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 50 mM 2-ME ( Gibco BRL ) . 
For ex vivo detection of in vivo induced cytokine production , cells were incubated for 4 h in complete medium in the presence of Brefeldin A only , before analysis of intracellular cytokines . 
Statistics
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Student 's or Wilcoxon 's t-test . 
p < 0.05 ( * ) was considered statistically significant , p < 0.01 ( ** ) highly significant . 
*** ; p < 0.001 .
