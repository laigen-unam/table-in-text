Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium utilizes macrophages to disseminate from the intestine to deeper tissues within the body . 
While S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has been shown to kill its host macrophage , it can persist intracellularly beyond 18 h postinfection . 
To identify factors involved in late stages of infection , we screened a transposon library made in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium for the ability to persist in J774 mac-rophages at 24 h postinfection . 
Through this screen , we identiﬁed a gene , sciS , found to be homologous to icmF in Legionella pneumophila . 
icmF , which is required for intracellular multiplication , is conserved in several gram-negative pathogens , and its homolog appears to have been acquired horizontally in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
We found that an sciS mutant displayed increased intracellular numbers in J774 macrophages when compared to the wild-type strain at 24 h postinfection . 
sciS was maximally transcribed at 27 h postinfection and is repressed by SsrB , an activator of genes required for promoting intracellular survival . 
Finally , we demonstrate that an sciS mutant is hypervirulent in mice when administered intragastrically . 
Taken together , these data indicate a role for SciS in controlling intracellular bacterial levels at later stages of infection and attenuating virulence in a murine host 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an enteric patho-gen that causes a self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans and a systemic typhoid-like disease in mice . 
Macrophages are an essential vehicle for the pathogenesis of S. enterica serovar Typhi-murium , which utilizes them to disseminate from the intestine to the spleen and liver . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium survives inside and eventually kills its host macrophage . 
Much has been published on how S. enterica serovar Typhimurium manipulates the macrophage phagosome to facilitate survival ( 15 , 19 , 25 , 37 , 41 ) as well as how it kills macrophages ( 2 , 5 , 17 , 20 , 27 , 39 ) , but little is known about the factors that allow it to persist intracellularly beyond 24 h . 
This study provides evidence that a horizontally acquired gene , sciS , limits intracellular replication of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in macro-phages at late stages of infection . 
Pathogenicity islands , which are horizontally acquired pieces of DNA that confer virulence traits , are especially crucial for the interaction of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium with eukaryotic host cells . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium contains two highly studied pathogenicity islands on its chromosome -- Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 ( SPI1 and -2 ) -- which encode separate type III secretion systems ( TTSS ) that facilitate invasion and survival , respectively . 
In the absence of SPI1 , infected macrophages are not killed at early time points ( 1 to 6 h postinfection ) ( 23 , 39 ) . 
A second killing pathway , mediated by SPI2 , results in host cell death at 18 to 24 h postinfection ( 39 ) . 
Despite this second killing pathway , bacteria can still persist inside intact macrophages beyond 24 h. To identify factors involved in the long-term persistence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in macrophages , we isolated mutants

with enhanced survival in macrophages at 24 h postinfection . 
One of the mutants identiﬁed was sciS , a homolog of icmF that is contained in several gram-negative pathogens . 
icmF was ﬁrst studied in L. pneumophila , where it is part of the Dot/Icm cluster of genes that form a type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) required for host cell killing and intracellular multiplication ( 29 , 34 ) . 
Three recent studies have shown icmF to be critical for allowing L. pneumophila to replicate in its own modiﬁed vacuole by maintaining an intact T4SS . 
IcmF was shown to be `` partially required '' for replication in human mac-rophages and essential for intracellular growth in amoeba ( 44 ) . 
Another study showed that DotU and IcmF are required for the formation of replicative vacuoles and the translocation of the T4SS substrate , SidC ( 40 ) . 
Additionally , DotU and IcmF serve to prevent degradation of type IV secretion components , indicating a role in stabilizing the T4SS ( 35 ) . 
A conserved cluster of 15 genes surrounding icmF in Vibrio cholerae has been designated IcmF-associated homologous proteins ( IAHP ) ( 9 ) . 
Gram-negative pathogens containing the icmF homolog have from 6 to 14 of the 15 genes in this cluster , but there is some variability in the composition and arrangement between the species . 
icmF in V. cholerae is induced under in vivo conditions as measured in a rabbit ileal loop model ( 8 ) . 
An icmF insertion mutant showed a nearly twofold increase in interleukin-8 mRNA levels in V. cholerae-infected intestinal epithelial cells when compared with the wild type ( 32 ) . 
The same insertion mutant showed reduced motility , increased adherence to epithelial cells , and a higher conjugation frequency , leading to speculation that it is involved in bacterial cell surface reorganization ( 7 ) . 
The importance of icmF homologs is highlighted by their conservation in nine different gram-negative pathogenic species ( 9 ) ; however , their exact function remains unclear . 
Most bacteria that contain an icmF homolog are pathogenic and maintain close contact with eukaryotic cells . 
Therefore , it is likely that icmF homologs and associated proteins play an important role in bacterial pathogenesis . 
The icmF homolog in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , sciS , named for salmonella centisome 7 island , is located within a 44-kb genomic island , which contains 9 of the 15 IAHP genes . 
A deletion of the entire island causes a defect in the ability of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to enter Hep-2 cells ( 12 ) . 
The only individual genes studied in this island constitute the Sal-monella atypical ﬁmbrial ( saf ) operon that was not required for mouse virulence ( 11 ) . 
The remaining open reading frames in this island have not been characterized , but several encode putative proteins with homology to known virulence proteins . 
In this study , we identiﬁed sciS in a transposon mutant screen and investigated its role in the long-term persistence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium inside macrophages . 
We determined that SciS limits intracellular growth in macrophages only at late stages of infection and attenuates the lethality of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in a murine host . 
Together , these data constitute a unique example of a horizontally acquired , temporally regulated gene that controls S. enterica se-rovar Typhimurium virulence in mice .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and DNA manipulations . 
All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth overnight at 37 °C . 
Antibiotics , when added , were used at the following concentrations : choramphenicol ( Cm ) , 30 g/ml ; kanamy-cin ( Kan ) , 60 g/ml ; carbenicillin ( Carb ) , 100 g/ml ; and tetracycline ( Tet ) , 20 g/ml . 
All strains and plasmids used or constructed in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
The construction of the sciS nonpolar deletion ( DP103 ) was performed using the pMAK705 temperature-sensitive plasmid-based system ( 1 ) . 
A fragment containing the mutation in sciS , plus at least 2 kb of ﬂanking DNA on either side was cloned into suicide plasmid pMAK705 . 
The two fragments were ampliﬁed from the chromosome using primers TCTAGAGCATCCAGCTTCATGAATG TCGATGAG and CTGCAGGATACTCAACTGGTCGGCCAC for fragment 1 and primers CTGCAGCAGATCGCTTCGCTGCTGACC and AAGCTTGCA CATAGTCGCGCTGGTCCG for fragment 2 . 
Fragment 1 contains an Nterminal XbaI restriction site and a C-terminal PstI restriction site and ends 1,413 bp into the SciS open reading frame . 
Fragment 2 contains an N-termi-nal Pst1 restriction site and a C-terminal HindIII site and begins 2,959 bp into the 3,871-bp SciS open reading frame . 
These two fragments were cloned separately into pCRBlunt ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , excised , and ligated together into pMAK705 , creating a 1,545-bp deletion in sciS . 
The resulting plasmid , pMAKf12 , was transformed into 14028 at 30 °C on LB-Cam plates . 
Resulting colonies were then selected for growth on Cam plates at the nonpermissive temperature 42 °C , which forces the integration of the plasmid into the chromosome via homologous recombination . 
To select the rare double crossover event , ampicillin enrichment was used to remove those colonies that still contained the plasmid . 
Any chloramphenicol-sensitive bacteria remaining were then screened via PCR for the correct mutation . 
The resulting strain , DP103 , contains a 1,546-bp nonpolar deletion spanning bp 1413 to 2959 in the 3,870-bp sciS open reading frame . 
The sciS chromosomal lacZ fusion ( DP137 ) was also made using pMAK705 , but the resulting cointegrate was not resolved , leaving an sciS upstream fragment transcriptionally fused to lacZ and an intact sciS gene . 
A DNA fragment covering the promoter region of sciS was ampliﬁed from the chromosome via PCR using the primers GGTACCCCCTGTCAGAGGACAGACTCC and GGATCCCAG CGGCCCGACAAACCAGAC . 
The sciS promoter fragment spanning positions 1000 through 95 was ligated into the suicide plasmid pSC433 ( pMAK705 : : lacZ ) , generating plasmid pDP136 ( sciS : : lacZ ) . 
This plasmid was electroporated into 14028 , and the resulting colonies were grown at 42 °C to select for single crossovers into the chromosome . 
The resulting chromosomal construct was transferred into a new 14028 background by P22 transduction . 
The resulting strain was conﬁrmed via PCR before use in intracellular - galactosidase assays . 
Eukaryotic cells and infection procedure . 
The murine macrophage cell line , J774A0 .1 ( American Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Manassas , Va. ) , was maintained in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Gibco-BRL , Rock-ville , Md. ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco-BRL ) , 0.2 mM MEM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco-BRL ) , and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids ( Gibco-BRL ) . 
J774 macrophages in tissue culture plates were infected with over-night cultures grown rolling at 37 °C . 
Prior to infection , cultures were adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 1.0 and resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) . 
After the addition of bacteria , the plates were centrifuged at 25 °C for 5 min and placed in a 37 °C incubator with CO for 25 min . 
Cells were 2 then washed three times with PBS to remove extracellular bacteria , and fresh DMEM containing 100 g/ml gentamicin was added for 1 h at 37 °C to kill extracellular bacteria . 
The plates were washed once with PBS and then incubated with 20 g/ml gentamicin at 37 °C . 
Selection and screen for persistent mutants in J774 macrophages . 
A mutant bank was generated in DP101 ( invA : : cam ) using MudJ transposon mutagenesis with P22 ( 21 ) . 
The bank was plated on large M9 minimal media agar plates to reduce the number of auxotrophs . 
Approximately 50,000 mutants were generated on 12 separate plates . 
Each plate was scraped , and the bacteria resuspended in 2 ml of LB with 10 % glycerol and frozen at 80 °C . 
An overnight culture was grown from each pool and J774 macrophages in 6-well plates were infected ( as described above ) at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 bacterium to 10 macrophages . 
After 24 h of infection , the 12 infected wells were washed with PBS and the remaining macrophages were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma Chemical , St. Louis , MO ) . 
These lysates were used to start overnight cultures , and 12 new wells were infected . 
This process was repeated three times to enrich for mutants that remained inside the macrophage . 
Four of the 12 pools showed a sharp increase in bacterial numbers after three passages . 
Individual mutants from these pools were scored for cytotoxicity on J774 macrophages in 96-well plates . 
Three candidate mutants from each of the four pools were selected and their MudJ insertions were sequenced by inverse PCR , and the results are listed in Table 2 . 
Cytotoxicity assays . 
These assays were performed as previously described by van der Velden et al. ( 39 ) . 
Brieﬂy , J774 macrophages seeded in 96-well plates were infected with overnight stationary-phase cultures of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium at an MOI of approximately 50 . 
At the indicated time points , the supernatant was removed and used to determine the release of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . 
Cytotoxicity was determined for each strain

Microscopy . 
J774 macrophages were grown on glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates prior to infection with Salmonella strains containing the plasmid pEGFP . 
Cells were infected at an MOI of 80 or 10 . 
After 24 h of infection , cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 3.6 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 25 °C . 
The coverslips were then stained with either 4 ,6 - diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ; Sigma Chemical ) alone or with FM4-64 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) and 4N,6N-diamidino-2-phenylindole at 25 °C for 1 h. Ten ﬁelds were randomly chosen for each coverslip , and images were taken using an Applied Precision Image Restoration System ( Advanced Precision Instruments , Issaquah , WA ) . 
All images were taken at 60 . 
Image stacks of 5 steps spaced 0.2 microns apart were taken and deconvolved . 
Selected images were saved in TIFF format and imported into Adobe Photoshop to be formatted for publication . 
The number of bacteria per infected macrophage was counted double blind for each ﬁeld . 
Intracellular - galactosidase assays . 
Activity of - galactosidase was assayed as described previously ( 26 ) . 
To measure the - galactosidase activity from intracellular bacteria , macrophages were grown in 6-well plates and infected with DP137 at an MOI of 50 , as described above . 
Cells were collected from 3 wells and lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 at the indicated time points . 
Lysates were serially diluted and plated to determine the number of intracellular bacteria . 
- Galactosidase activity was expressed in Miller units per 109 bacteria . 
Screen for regulators of SciS . 
A modiﬁed tetracycline-inducible transposon ( T-POP ) was constructed by replacing the original Tn10 ends with Tn5 ends ( 30 ) . 
The T-POP transposon used the primers 5 - CAGCTGTCTCTTATACACATC TCCATTAAGGTTACCATCACGGA-3 and 5 - CAGCTGTCTCTTATACAC ATCTGTGATCTCGGGAAAAGCGTTGGTGA-3 . 
The resulting fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO ( Invitrogen ) to yield a vector containing the Tn5 T-POP . 
The transposon was excised from the vector with PvuII and pu-riﬁed . 
This Tn5 T-POP transposon was used to mutagenize the sciS : : lacZ strain ( DP137 ) . 
A complex containing the Tn5 T-POP transposon and puriﬁed transposase was electroporated into electrocompetent DP137 . 
Transposition of the transposon then occurred randomly within the bacterial chromosome . 
Bacteria containing transposon insertions were then selected by plating on tetracycline and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ( X-Gal ) plates . 
Those mutations that caused a color change from DP137 ( light blue ) were transduced into DP137 and retested for color change . 
Chromosomal DNA was puriﬁed from those colonies that retained a color change and the transposon insertion site was sequenced . 
Real-time PCR analysis . 
Total RNA from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected J774 macrophages ( MOI of 50 ) was isolated using hot phenol extraction and cleaned with an RNeasy Mini column ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) and used as a template to make cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the cDNA using primers to sciS and gyrB as a control . 
rpoD was initially used as a control in our real-time PCR assays , as this gene has been established as a steadily transcribed housekeeping gene for use as an internal control ( 33 ) . 
However , the primers to this gene seem to cross-react with eukaryotic cDNA , so rpoD could not be used as an internal control for real-time PCR performed on cDNA from infected macrophages . 
gyrB was suggested as a housekeeping gene to use as an internal control ( personal communication with Ferric Fang ) . 
Primers to gyrB were tested in real-time PCR experiments on cDNA from bacterial cultures in parallel with rpoD primers and both genes were transcribed equally in all conditions tested . 
Each real-time PCR was run in quadruplicate and values were expressed as fold induction to gyrB . 
The fold induction of wild-type-infected macrophages at 5 h was set to 1 . 
Values are the average of three separate experiments . 
Mouse studies . 
Mice were inoculated intragastrically with 200 l of an over-night culture of either 14028 or sciS that was resuspended and diluted in PBS . 
The following doses were given to groups of 4 mice : 3.1 104 , 3.1 105 , 3.1 106 for 14028 and 3.3 104 , 3.3 105 , 3.3 106 for sciS . 
This experiment was repeated with groups of 8 mice with the following doses : 3.64 104 , 3.64 105 , 3.64 106 for 14028 and 3.70 104 , 3.70 105 , 3.70 106 for sciS . 
Mice were monitored for 28 days for survival , and 50 % lethal dose ( LD50 ) values were calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench ( 31 ) .

RESULTS
A selection and screen for mutants that persist in macro-phages identiﬁed sciS . 
To investigate the contribution of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium genes at late stages of infection , MudJ transposon mutants that survived in J774 macrophages for 24 h without causing host cell lysis were selected . 
The bacteria used to infect the macrophages were from a bank of 50,000 MudJ transposon mutants divided into 12 separate pools . 
To prevent early killing of the macrophages , mutants were generated in a strain deleted for invA . 
The SPI1 TTSS has been shown to induce rapid apoptosis in macrophages , and InvA is required for its formation ( 24 , 38 ) . 
J774 macrophages were infected at an MOI of 0.1 , and at 25 min postinfection gentamicin was added to the extracellular media to eliminate those bacteria that did n't invade or escaped their host cell via lysis . 
By infecting at an MOI of 0.1 , the majority of infected macrophages would contain a homogeneous population of rep licating bacteria derived from a single progenitor . 
Following 24 h of infection , the remaining macrophages were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 and the intracellular bacteria were recovered , used to start an overnight culture and infect new macrophages . 
This process of serial passaging was repeated three times , enriching the pools for persistent mutants . 
Four of the original 12 pools showed an increase in bacteria recovered from infected macrophages after three passages . 
Individual mutant from each of these four `` enriched '' pools were then isolated and screened in J774 macrophages for persistence . 
Three MudJ insertions from each pool were sequenced giving a total of 12 individual sequences ( Table 2 ) . 
These sequences included sciS as well as genes involved in DNA repair and pro-panediol metabolism . 
Based on its homology to a known virulence gene in L. pneumophila and its location in a genomic island , sciS was chosen for further characterization . 
An sciS mutant is more numerous in J774 macrophages at 24 h postinfection . 
Surprisingly , none of the mutants isolated had measurable defects in cytotoxicity on J774 macrophages ( data not shown ) as measured by LDH release and crystal violet staining ( 39 ) . 
Because the mutants were cytolytically normal , their persistence suggested that they had differences in intracellular numbers that led to their selection . 
Mutations that caused reduced intracellular replication could lead to an inability to break out of the phagosome , thus leading to a persistent state that would allow their selection . 
Conversely , mutations that cause overgrowth could be preferentially selected due to a higher representation of this population . 
To determine the effect of an sciS mutation on intracellular bacterial numbers we constructed a nonpolar deletion of sciS ( DP103 ) and infected J774 macrophages to determine its effect on intracellular replication . 
We used two methods to enumerate intracellular bacteria : ( i ) quantitation of intracellular bacteria and ( ii ) visual inspection of bacteria per infected macrophage via microscopy . 
The ﬁrst method is standard for measuring intracellular replication and involves lysing macrophages at 24 h postinfection and plating intracellular bacteria . 
The wildtype strain and DP103 had similar intracellular numbers of viable bacteria at 6 h postinfection . 
However , Salmonella 14028-infected macrophages contained two - to threefold less CFU than DP103-infected macrophages past 24 h postinfection ( Fig. 1A ) . 
DP103 was also retested for cytotoxicity on J774 macrophages and showed no signiﬁcant difference from wild type at 6 or 24 h postinfection ( Fig. 1B ) . 
To more directly visualize what was occurring in individual host cells , wide-ﬁeld deconvolution ﬂuorescence microscopy was used to enumerate intracellular bacteria . 
For these studies , 14028 and DP103 were transformed with the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - containing plasmid pEGFP , resulting in strains DP148 and DP114 , respectively . 
J774 macrophages were infected with either DP148 or DP114 for 24 h , ﬁxed , and then stained with DAPI ( DNA ; blue ) and FM4-64 ( membrane ; red ) . 
Microscopy experiments were then performed using MOIs of 10 and 80 ( Fig. 2A to D ) . 
In each experiment , the number of bacteria per infected cell was determined double blind for each strain in 10 separate ﬁelds ( Fig. 2E ) . 
The results show that macrophages infected with an sciS mutation at an MOI of 10 had 63 % more intracellular bacteria than the wild type at 24 h postinfection , while an MOI of 80 showed a 94 % increase . 
All experimental MOIs in this study fall within the range of 10 to 80 established with the microscopy results . 
Differences in intracellular bacterial numbers were not evident between the strains at 6 h post-infection , as macrophages infected with an sciS mutation showed 7.9 bacteria per infected cell versus 8.4 for wild type at an MOI of 80 ( data not shown ) . 
However , the sciS mutant had signiﬁcantly increased intracellular bacterial numbers when measured at 24 h postinfection , correlating well with the selection procedure . 
sciS is maximally expressed in host macrophages at 27 h postinfection . 
The difference in intracellular numbers at late but not early time points suggested that sciS might not be expressed until late during the infection process . 
To investigate the temporal expression of sciS inside cells , we constructed an sciS promoter fusion to lacZ ( DP137 ) . 
Macrophages were infected with DP137 and - galactosidase activity was measured at seven time points between 10 and 34 h postinfection ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In vitro , sciS was transcribed at undetectable levels above background ; it was also minimally transcribed inside macrophages before 10 h postinfection ( data not shown ) . 
sciS induction is markedly different than that of SPI2 genes as expression levels for seven SPI2 genes encoding effectors or structural proteins have either peaked or leveled off at 8 h postinfection ( 6 ) . 
We found that sciS was maximally transcribed inside macrophages at 27 h postinfection . 
The timing of sciS transcription correlates well with the ﬁnding that an sciS mutant selected at 24 h postinfection shows increased intracellular numbers at the same time but not at 6 h postinfection . 
To verify this ﬁnding , we isolated total RNA from 14028-infected macrophages at 5 and 24 h postinfection . 
We measured sciS mRNA levels using quantitative real-time PCR . 
We found that sciS mRNA levels were sevenfold higher at 24 h than at 5 h postinfection , in agreement with our previous observations ( Fig. 4 ) . 
SsrB negatively regulates SciS . 
The late transcription of sciS in host cells raised questions as to how it was regulated . 
To identify genes that affected expression of sciS , DP137 ( sciS : : lacZ promoter fusion ) was mutagenized with a modiﬁed T-POP transposon . 
The 6,000 colonies from the mutagenesis procedure were screened for differences in transcription of sciS from the parental strain . 
The parental strain ( DP137 ) appears light blue on an LB plate containing X-Gal , so those colonies that were white or dark blue were selected for further analysis . 
A dark blue colony was isolated containing a transposon insertion within ssrB . 
It was predicted to be a negative regulator of sciS , as the transposon insertion within ssrB lead to increased expression of sciS . 
To verify this , real-time PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from macrophages infected with either an ssrB mutant or wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium at 5 h postinfection . 
There were not sufﬁcient numbers of intracellular bacteria at 24 h postinfection to provide the RNA necessary to do real-time PCR , as an ssrAB mutation impairs intracellular replication in macrophages ( 6 ) . 
Real-time PCR showed a ﬁvefold increase in sciS transcription in an ssrB mutant when compared to wild type at 5 h postinfection , conﬁrming that SsrB negatively regulates sciS ( Fig. 4 ) . 
However , it is not known if SsrB directly or indirectly regulates sciS . 
A sciS mutant is hypervirulent in mice . 
Having shown that sciS is important in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis of tissue culture macrophages , we tested its contribution to S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence in an in vivo mouse model . 
Groups of eight BALB/c mice were injected intragastrically with either 14028 or DP103 ( sciS ) and monitored for survival over a 28-day period . 
Mice began dying at approximately the same day , regardless of the inoculating strain ; however , only half of the wild-type inoculated mice had died by day 9 while all of the DP103 inoculated mice died by day 11 ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The LD50 calculated for DP103 was eightfold lower than that of 14028 , indicating that the mutant was hypervirulent . 
This experiment was also done with groups of 4 mice , showing a ninefold reduction in LD50 for DP103 ( data not shown ) . 
This was an unexpected result , given that only two other mutations in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( grvA , pcgL ) have shown an increase in virulence ( 18 , 28 ) .

DISCUSSION
To identify genes associated with the later stages of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of macrophages , mutants were selected that persisted inside macrophages at 24 h postinfection . 
This selection isolated a gene , sciS , which limits rep-lication in host macrophages and decreases virulence in mice . 
The increase in bacterial numbers seen with an sciS mutant at 24 h postinfection was not observed in macrophages at 6 h postinfection or in epithelial cells at any time . 
In addition to sciS , several other genes were identiﬁed in this study that were primarily involved in DNA repair and propanediol metabo-lism . 
These genes were most likely selected because the mutations attenuated bacterial growth , preventing them from ly-sing their host cells . 
There are homologs of sciS in several other gram-negative pathogens , but the ﬁrst identiﬁed and best characterized is icmF in L. pneumophila . 
Recently , icmF was isolated in a screen for mutants that have a growth defect because of an inability to lyse out of their host macrophage at the end of an infection cycle ( 40 ) . 
It is interesting that icmF was isolated in much the same way that sciS was identiﬁed by enriching pools of mutagenized bacteria in macrophages with gentamicin in the extracellular media . 
Previous studies have implicated icmF as being partially required for survival in human macrophages , which would seem to contradict the phenotype for sciS reported in this study . 
However , differences in the way the multiplication assays are performed can explain this discrepancy . 
Multiplication assays performed in L. pneumophila typically measure numbers of bacteria in the supernatant , while replication assays in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium typically measure only the bacteria residing intracellularly . 
A delay or inability of bacteria to escape their host phagosome would result in a decreased bacterial load in the supernatant . 
It is tempting to speculate that sciS could play this role in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , and this would help explain the increased bacterial loads in infected macrophages . 
While there is an abundance of studies on S. enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced host cell killing , egress of the bacteria from the phagosome and events during the latter stages of infection of macrophages have not been studied extensively . 
sciS was induced only in host cells and its expression peaked at 27 h postinfection , correlating well with the selection procedure and the increased bacterial loads seen only at 24 h of infection . 
Interestingly , sciS transcription is negatively regulated by SsrB , a two-component regulator that activates salmo-nella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) genes and additional genes outside of SPI2 that are primarily involved in promoting systemic infection of the host ( 4 , 6 , 13 , 41 , 43 ) . 
Soon after uptake of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in macrophages , SsrB is expressed and induces several proteins that facilitate intracellular replication ( 10 , 36 , 42 ) . 
ssrB RNA levels are reduced later during infection of macrophages ( J. Rue , unpublished data ) , leading to the derepression of sciS at 24 h postinfection . 
The early expression of SsrB and its subsequent downregulation possibly could help explain the delayed expression of SciS . 
Previously reported SsrB-regulated genes are activated , making this the ﬁrst evidence for SsrB-mediated repression . 
However , it is n't clear if repression of sciS by SsrB is direct or if there are intermediate factors involved . 
SsrB facilitates S. enterica serovar Typhimurium survival and replication inside macrophages following uptake , and perhaps its subsequent downregulation allows sciS to be expressed , limiting the bacteria from overgrowing their host cell or allowing for escape from the vacuole . 
To our knowledge , sciS is the ﬁrst example of a gene involved in limiting intracellular replication of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in macrophages . 
Previously , several genes were identiﬁed that prevent overgrowth of S. enterica serovar Typhi-murium in ﬁbroblasts ( 3 ) . 
The master regulator PhoP-PhoQ had the most profound effect on controlling replication , which was unexpected because in other cell types , PhoP-PhoQ is associated with promoting survival and replication . 
These differences in replication were measured at 24 h postinfection , paralleling what was seen with sciS in macrophages . 
While S. enterica serovar Typhimurium replicates more efﬁciently in macrophages than in ﬁbroblasts , our results provide evidence that sciS is involved in attenuating bacterial growth in host macrophages at later stages of infection . 
It is important for pathogens to limit their effects upon the cells they infect in order to achieve a balance with their host . 
An example of this phenomenon on a cellular level of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis is demonstrated with its invasion process . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium injects SopE and SopE2 into epithelial cells to activate Cdc42 and Rac1 which induces rufﬂing and promotes uptake of the bacteria into host cells ( 16 ) . 
Another secreted protein , SptP , reverses these effects to restore a normal actin cytoskeleton once the bacterium is inside of the cell ( 14 ) . 
These proteins are delivered simultaneously in equal amounts ; however , the SptP protein is degraded much more slowly than SopE , allowing it to reverse the effects of SopE ( 22 ) . 
It is interesting that this process is temporally regulated , as a process set in motion by the bacterium can be purposely modulated at a later time . 
This is a recurring theme in pathogenesis and one that is further illustrated with sciS . 
The attenuation of deleterious effects upon a host cell can be further extended to an animal model , as a sciS deletion showed an eightfold increase in lethality with a mouse model . 
This hypervirulent phenotype in mice was initially a surprise , given that almost all known S. enterica serovar Typhimurium mutations reduce virulence . 
Only two other S. enterica serovar Typhimurium mutations have been shown to increase virulence in mice ( 18 , 28 ) . 
A null mutation in grvA increased virulence , as measured by competitive index experiments in mouse spleens and small intestine . 
Interestingly , grvA is carried on the lamdoid phage Gifsy-2 near srfH , which was shown to be activated by the SsrAB regulon ( 42 ) . 
However , it is not known whether SsrB regulates GrvA . 
Another study determined that inactivation of the dipeptidase pcgL led to an accumulation of D-Ala-D-Ala , which caused an increase in bacterial numbers in mouse liver and spleen 24 h postinoculation . 
The occurrence of the phenotype within 24 h of inoculation suggested that the accumulation of D-Ala-D-Ala somehow compromised the innate immune system leading to faster bacterial growth in host tissues . 
Both of these studies demonstrate that it is possible for an inactivated gene to lead to an increase in bacterial numbers in host tissues . 
Increased bacterial loads in a murine host would likely lead to more rapid sepsis and toxic shock , thus increasing lethality . 
The increased intracellular numbers observed in an sciS mutant appear to be consistent with this idea , as an sciS mutant is hypervirulent in orally infected mice . 
Most studies in bacterial pathogenesis are directed toward ﬁnding genes that promote virulence in the host . 
sciS is a unique example of a horizontally acquired gene that is temporally regulated and limits S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence .
