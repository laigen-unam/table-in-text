Abstract 
Salmonella infection of chickens that leads to potential human foodborne salmonellosis continues to be a concern . 
Changes in the pH of poultry gastrointestinal tract could inﬂuence Salmonella growth and virulence response . 
In the current study , growth responses of a chicken isolate Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( ST ) to three incremental pH-shifts ( 6.17 -- 7.35 ) in continuous cultures ( CC ) were evaluated . 
The expression of rpoS and hilA was determined by real time-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) as well . 
Increases in pH resulted in higher cell protein concentrations , glucose disappearance , and glucose and ATP yields . 
Although with some inconsistency between the two trials , the data indicated that the ammonia release into media was favored by low pH. The pH shifts did not signiﬁcantly affect acetate biosynthesis . 
No consistent trends of pH inﬂuence on propionate and butyrate production could be detected . 
In all three pH shifts , relative expression of hilA was dominant at 0 h which represented CC steady state . 
In pH shift 7.35 -- 6.86 ( Trial 1 ) , the relative expression of rpoS at time 0 and 1 h were over ﬁve-fold higher than after 3 and 6 h of growth . 
Overall , the results suggest that ST physiology is altered by changes in pH , which could be determinant factors for ST survival in the poultry gastrointestinal ecosystems .

1. Introduction
Foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella have the capability to survive various environmental stresses including extreme pH , nutrient deprivation , oxygen stress , osmotic shock and heat [ 1 ] . 
The in vitro invasion of serovar Typhimurium ( ST ) into cultured mammalian epithelial cells is complex and involves genetic loci and host factors [ 2,3 ] . 
Genes are required for the intestinal phase of ST invasion and are located on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI 1 ) located at centisome 63 on the chromosome [ 4 ] .

regulate the expression of invasion genes in response to environmental conditions including pH , osmolarity , oxygen tension and low nutrients [ 5 ] . 
It is encoded on SPI 1 and directly activates the type III secretion systems ( TTSS ) genes [ 6 -- 9 ] . 
The hilA encoding protein is believed to be a requirement for Salmonella invasion due to its transcriptional properties [ 5,7 ] . 
rpoS encodes an RNA polymerase sigma factor ( dS or d38 ) known to regulate at least 60 genes in response to environmental signals including various stress conditions , nutrient limitation , osmotic challenge , acid shock , heat shock , oxidative damage , redox potential , and steady and stationary growth phase [ 10 -- 15 ] . 
rpoS expression is related to several low pH inducible acid defense systems that expand the limit of pH tolerance of ST and are referred to collectively as acid tolerance response ( ATR ) [ 16 -- 18 ] . 
Continuous culture ( CC ) techniques have provided a representative in vitro model to study microbial metabolism under GI tract conditions [ 19 -- 24 ] . 
The growth of bacteri in CC in chemostat provides growth conditions that are more closely related to the in vivo ecosystem [ 24 ] . 
CC techniques have been used to simulate the GI tract microenvironment of the human [ 21,22 ] and various animal species including chickens [ 23,24 ] and ruminants [ 19,20 ] . 
This study utilized CC to evaluate the growth and the pathogenesis of ST during pH shifts . 
Monitoring cell parameters in CC including cell protein concentration , ammonia utilization , glucose and ATP yield can be useful for predicting and modulating bacterial behavior under changing environmental conditions such as those occurring in gastrointestinal tracts [ 19,24,25 ] . 
The typical pH of chicken gastrointestinal tract ranges from 5.7 to 6.4 [ 26 ] but pH ﬂuctuations can occur due to a variety of reasons including pathogen proliferation and management practices such as feed withdrawal [ 27 ] . 
Goldstein [ 28 ] reported chicken cecal pH ranging from 6.7 to 7.8 . 
Similar conditions favor Salmonella growth , which is considered optimal in the pH from 6.5 to 7.5 [ 29,30 ] . 
According to Apajalahti et al. [ 31 ] , small changes in pH , diets , and environmental conditions may change the bacterial habitat and species distribution along chicken intestines . 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate physiological cell parameters , short-chain fatty acid productions , and virulence genes responses ( hilA and rpoS ) of ST in rather small , frequently encountered pH ﬂuctuations in the chicken GI tract which , however , can still be important modulators of ST proliferation and behavior .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strain and media preparation
ST strain was selected for resistance to novobiocin and nalidixic acid ( NO : NA ) and has been previously described by Ziprin et al. [ 32 ] . 
Maintenance and conﬁrmation of bacterial culture integrity was described previously [ 33 ] . 
The strain was grown in Luria Bertani ( LB ) medium containing ( w/v ) : 1 % bacto tryptose ( Difco Labora-tm tories , Detroit , MI ) , 0.5 % yeast extract ( Difco ) , and 0.1 % glucose . 
The pH ( 6.5 -- 8 ) of media was adjusted accordingly with NaOH ( 0.2 M ) and HCl ( 37 % ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St Louis , MO ) . 
2.2. Preparation of Salmonella typhimurium inoculum
ST was streaked on an LB agar plate and incubated ( Precison Scientiﬁc , Winchester , VA ) overnight at 39 1C . 
After incubation , colonies were used to inoculate 3 mL of LB broth in 15-mL borosilicate tubes . 
Tubes were incubated at 39 1C for 18 h . 
The inocula were vortexed and introduced into the CC system growth vessels . 
2.3. Apparatus and CC systems
The CC systems were established in 1.0-l volume Bio-Flo 110 chemostat/fermentors ( New Brunswick Scientiﬁc 
Company , Edison , NJ ) . 
The chemostats were prepared and calibrated according to New Brunswick Scientiﬁc Company Handbook ( New Brunswick Scientiﬁc Company ) . 
LB broth medium ( described in the previous section ) and the chemostats were sterilized ( 40 min at 21 psi pressure and at 121 1C ) , with 500 mL media volumes . 
The chemostats were maintained anaerobically with a constant stream of O2-free CO2 [ 36 ] , at 39 1C and agitated at 100 rpm . 
LB media in chemostat vessels and diluent bottles were initiated at pH 6.5 and a constant dilution rate of 0.05 h . 
Samples were taken ( 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 , and 96 h ) after 1 which diluent bottles were subsequently changed for the pH shifts ; each cycle initiated at steady states ( obtained after four turnovers or 96 h ) . 
The chemostats were monitored by determining the pH ( Corning 430 , Corning , NY ) and OD ( A600 ) with a UV -- vis light spectrophoto-meter ( Spectronic 20 D ; Thermo Spectronic Corporation , Buffalo , NY ) . 
2.4. Sample collection
For each sample 8 mL aliquot of culture was collected from chemostats at designated periods using a sterile pipette ( Drummond Scientiﬁc Co. , Bromall , PA ) . 
The pH and OD readings ( OD600 ) were determined . 
Aliquots ( 400 mL ) of the culture were preserved immediately in 800 mL of RNA protect ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and stored at 20 1C ( Kenmore ; Sears Corp. , Chicago , IL ) . 
These were used for analyses of gene expression ( hilA , rpoS and 16S rRNA ) . 
Three milliliters of the sample was centrifuged ( Labnet , Hermle Z180M , Burladingen , Germany ) at 6000 g for 6 min . 
The supernatant was aspirated from the cells with a syringe and was ﬁlter sterilized through a 0.45-mm pore size membrane ﬁlter ( Pall Corporation , Ann Arbor , MI ) . 
Supernatants were stored at 20 1C for glucose , ammonia and SCFA analyses , while cells were resuspended in 150 mL of 0.9 % NaCl solution for protein determination . 
2.5. Protein determination
Protein from NaOH-hydrolyzed cells ( 0.2 N NaOH , 100 1C , 15 min ) was assayed using the method described by Lowry et al. [ 34 ] . 
Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ; Sigma ) was used to generate a standard curve . 
2.6. Ammonia determination
Ammonia concentrations from the supernatants were measured by a modiﬁed colorimetric method described by Chaney and Marbach [ 35 ] . 
Ammonia concentrations in unused LB medium were determined in order to be able to calculate the net production of ammonia in the chemostat . 
2.7. Glucose and Yglc determination
Glucose determination was performed according to the NADH-linked enzyme assay of Bergmeyer and Klotsc 
[ 36 ] . 
Background levels of glucose in LB medium were measured in order to determine the net amount of glucose disappearance in the chemostat . 
Optical densities were read at 340 nm on a Gilford 520 spectrophotometer ( Gilford Instrument Laboratories , Sandusky , OH ) . 
Glucose yield ( Yglc ) was calculated from the milligrams cell protein per millimole of glucose that disappeared [ 37 ] . 
2.8. SCFA concentration and YATP determination
VFA concentrations were determined by gas chromato-graphy , as previously described by Corrier et al. [ 38 ] . 
The analyses were conducted with a gas chromatograph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector ( Shimadzu Corp. , Columbia , MD ) . 
ATP yield ( YATP ) was calculated based on the amount of cell protein ( mg ) produced per mmol ATP generated , in the form of fermentation endproducts . 
The amount of YATP per fermentation product was assigned as follows : acetate , 3 mmol ATP ; propionate , 3 mmol ATP ; and butyrate , 1 mmol ATP per mmol glucose that disappeared [ 25,39 ] . 
2.9. RNA extraction and primer design
RNA was extracted from ST cultures according to the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . 
Primers were designed by using primer express 1.0 Software ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Bio-systems , Foster City , CA ) and the DNA sequences for hilA , rpoS and 16S rRNA genes obtained from genBank website . 
Primer sequences were subsequently blasted on the NCBI website to determine if they were compatible with any other species of bacteria . 
The primers are listed in Table 1 . 
2.10. Reverse transcriptase reaction
To obtain cDNA for real time , reverse transcription reactions were performed using the reagents from the TaqMan OneStep real time-polymerase chain reaction s ( RT-PCR ) Kit . 
Each 20 mL reaction contained 10X RTPCR Buffer , 500 mM of dNTPs Mix , 20 U/reaction RNase Inhibitor , 25 mM MgCl2 , 200 ng of RNA , 2.0 mL of each Primer ( 2.5 mM ) , MultiScribeTM RT 1.25 / U mL and RNase-free water to a ﬁnal volume of 20 mL . 
A positive RT reaction was conducted to ensure the procedure was functioning correctly . 
The positive ( + ) reaction contained all of the same components except that a DNA template was used instead of a RNA template . 
To determine if RNA samples were contaminated with DNA , two negative ( ) RT reactions were run on each RNA sample . 
One ( ) RT reaction contained the same components as the positive ( + ) RT reactions , except it lacked the RNA sample template and contained more water to ensure that the ﬁnal concentration of the remaining components remained the same . 
The other ( ) RT reaction did not contain the RT enzyme to ensure that there was no DNA contamination . 
All one step RT reactions were performed on a Gene Amp PCR System from Perkin -- Elmer ( Wellesley , MA ) under the following conditions : incubation at 10 min at 25 1C , reverse transcriptase at 30 min at 45 1C , reverse transcriptase inactivation for 5 min at 95 1C , three-step cycling 1 min at 94 1C , 1 min at 53 1C and 1 min at 72 1C for 40 cycles . 
The samples were then held at 4 1C until the samples could be removed . 
2.11. RT-PCR reaction
RT-PCR reactions were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems ) . 
Each 20 mL SYBR Green PCR reaction contained 2 mL RNA , 0.2 mL ( mM ) of each primer , 10 mL 1X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Perkin-Elmer s Applied Biosystems ) , 0.1 mL MultiScribed Reverse Transcriptase ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem ) , 0.4 mL RNase Inhibitor ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem ) , and water . 
Thermal cycling conditions were as follows : 48 1C for 30 min , 95 1C for 10 min , and 40 repeats of 95 1C for 15 s and 60 1C for 1 min . 
2.12. Gene analysis and expression
RT-PCR reactions [ 40 -- 43 ] were run to determine the expression of three genes ; each gene was analyzed as triplicates for each sample . 
Data was analyzed using the relative quantiﬁcation method ( 2 DDCT [ 42 ] ) , which describes the change in expression of the target gene ( rpoS and hilA ) relative to a reference gene ( 16S rRNA ) from an untreated ST control sample ( steady state ) . 
Data was analyzed by averaging the CT value ( cycle at which each sample ampliﬁcation curve crosses a speciﬁc threshold ) for each triplicate sample . 
The resulting DCT values of the target genes were ( rpoS and hilA ) normalized by subtracting the DCT values of 16S rRNA control gene from the target genes ( rpoS and hilA ) . 
These samples were subsequently subtracted from the 16S rRNA gene from the untreated ST control sample , according to Fey et al. [ 44 ] . 
The resulting DDCT was used to calculate relative expression using the formula 2 DDCT [ 42 -- 46 ] .

Data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA subjected to linear regression using PC-SAS version 9 . 
[ 47 ] . 
Differences between means were determined using least-square means and Tukey 's honest signiﬁcance test . 
Statistical variation was also estimated by the standard deviation of the mean . 
All statistical analyses were considered signiﬁcant at ( Pp0 .05 ) . 
Correlations between pH and the means of other parameters were conducted by Kaleidagraph version 3.5 [ 48 ] . 
In our studies , ST grown in CC was subjected to three different pH shifts from diluents entering the chemostat with a constant dilution rate of 0.05 h . 
Samples were 1 taken at determined hours ( 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 , and 96 h ) starting after each change of diluent bottles was performed to reach a certain pH shift . 
Although the typical pH of chicken gastrointestinal tract is from 5.7 to 6.4 [ 26 ] , the range of 6.17 -- 7.35 in our study was chosen because of pH ﬂuctuations that may occur due to pathogen proliferation or feed withdrawal . 
Goldstein [ 28 ] reported chicken cecal pH levels ranging from 6.7 to 7.8 . 
The modiﬁed LB medium used in the experiments was considered equivalent in nutritional composition to a typical corn soybean-based poultry feed and was formulated to simulate the poultry feed [ 49 ] and the cecal microenvironment of poultry when nutrients are limiting . 
Cell protein concentrations in both trials exhibited similar trends ( Table 2 ) . 
Cell protein increased with the increase of pH , as the maximum levels were achieved at time 0 of pH 7.35 . 
Correlation between pH and cell protein equaled 61 % and 75 % for Trials 1 and 2 , respectively . 
Cell protein concentrations are usually determined on the basis of the depletion of energy source , however , the estimation of energy source utilization does not take into consideration the energy source that is incorporated into cell materials [ 50,51 ] . 
Yglc and glucose disappearance were inﬂuenced by pH shifts in a similar manner , achieving their maximum and minimum values in correspondence to maximum and minimum pH set of the medium in the chemostat ( Table 2 ) . 
These observations are not unexpected for Salmonella growth , which is considered optimal in the pH range from 6.5 to 7.5 [ 29,30 ] . 
In the current study , YATP was estimated on the basis of cell protein ( mg ) per mmol ATP [ 25,39 ] ( Table 2 ) . 
YATP of ST grown in different pH exhibited a similar pattern to the cell protein concentration and Yglc responses . 
In both trials , YATP ranged from 2.9 to 16.95 mg cell protein/mmol ATP corresponding to the lowest and highest values of media pH. Based on our results YATP appeared to be inﬂuenced by pH. It may be also inﬂuenced by the metabolism and growth physiology of ST under these conditions . 
The estimation of energy source utilization for cell biosynthesis does not take into consideration the energy source that is incorporated into cell materials [ 50,51 ] . 
If the ATP production from catabolism is minimal then most of the energy source will be used for energy . 
Conversely , the fraction of energy source used for carbon can be signiﬁcant , if ATP production is high [ 52 ]

Results and discussion 
3.1 . 
Cell characterization in CC during pH shifts 
Ammonia could be considered a fermentative by-product of proteins as well as a substrate for microbial growth [ 25,53 ] . 
Background analysis indicated that approximately 40 mg/L ammonia was found in the LB medium . 
However , as the pH shift continued , net accumulation of ammonia was observed during ST growth ( Table 2 ) . 
Although some inconsistency between the two trials occurred , the data indicated that the ammonia accumulation into media was favored by low pH. The increased ammonia concentrations may be due to more limited conversion of ammonia into bacterial cell protein as indicated by our data ( Table 2 ) . 
In addition , stress conditions favor the biosynthesis of abnormal or misfolded proteins which are subsequently degraded by intracellular proteases [ 54 ] . 
The increased intracellular levels of ammonia may slow down the ammonia uptake which is driven by unmediated diffusion [ 55,56 ] . 
ST production of SCFA in CC at various pH shifts is shown in Table 3 . 
Acetate was the predominant SCFA with an average production of 150 mmol/mL . 
The pH shifts , however , did not signiﬁcantly affect acetate biosynthesis . 
Changes in the absolute values of other SCFA including propionate and butyrate were also detected but no consistent trends of pH inﬂuence on their production were observed . 
Based on cells undergoing pH shifts from 6.17 to 6.90 , it appeared that the lowest pH in the chemostat medium corresponded to the lowest level of glucose utilization and SCFA production . 
Low pH is known to inhibit the colonization of ST by competitive exclusion of native microﬂora in the GI tract [ 57 -- 60 ] . 
The acetate : propionate ratio of ST was inconsistent for both trials ( Table 3 ) . 
Trial 1 showed signiﬁcantly ( Pp0 .05 ) lower acetate : propionate ratios in shifts 7.35 to 6.17 , while in Trial 2 , the lowest ration was obtained in the pH shift from 6.17 to 6.90 . 
According to Russell and Cook [ 52 ] , low acetate : - propionate ratio is an indicator for an efﬁcient turnover of bacterial cell . 
The low acetate : propionate in this pH shift in Trial 1 expectantly corresponded to the high levels of cell protein concentration within the same pH range . 
The relative expression of rpoS and hilA genes is shown in Table 4 . 
In the pH shift 7.35 -- 6.86 ( Trial 1 ) , the relative expression of rpoS at time 0 was over ﬁve - and two-fold higher than after 6 h of growth in Trials 1 and 2 , respectively . 
The overwhelming relative expression at 0 h in pH shift 7.35 -- 6.86 demonstrated that rpoS expression is inﬂuenced by the particular steady state prior to the pH shift and glucose utilization . 
However , it appeared that speciﬁc pH of the chemostat medium did not inﬂuence rpoS expression ( Table 4 ) . 
Previously , rpoS has been shown to be essential for the adaptive response of Salmonella to acid stress , including stationary phase physiology and stress responses [ 61 ] . 
In a recent study [ 62 ] , the utilization of an ex vivo swine stomach content demonstrated that rpoS among other genes were involved in ST survival against reduced pH and could be induced by lactic acid in gastric ﬂuid in simulated swine stomach . 
In our study although pH shifts in the chemostat were conducted , the pH range was probably not low enough to inﬂuence rpoS expression during growth of ST. Instead , pH shifts were grouped around optimal pH for growth to determine if ST would respond to subtle ﬂuctuations that occur in the GI tract . 
Stress conditions and dietary shifts in poultry can modulate the virulence of bacterial habitat of GI tract microenvironment [ 63 ] . 
Overall , the expression of hilA at time 0 in each pH shift was signiﬁcantly higher than at time 6 ( Table 3 ) . 
These results indicate that the expression of hilA gene was inﬂuenced by growth conditions prior to pH shift . 
The overall pH in the chemostat ranged from 7.35 to 6.17 and was not consistent with expected hilA expression . 
This suggested that lowering of immediate pH limited the inﬂuence on hilA expression . 
In both trials , at pH shifts 7.35 -- 6.86 and 6.17 -- 6.54 , the signiﬁcantly high levels of hilA and rpoS expression ( Table 4 ) were at 0 h. . 
These observations suggest that hilA and rpoS were already at maximum expression under these conditions prior to the shift in pH. Overall , both rpoS and hilA responded to pH shifts of the media in a similar manner resulting in 90 % correlation of their expression values when compared to each other .

4. Conclusions
Our studies revealed that cell protein concentration , glucose consumption and yield , and YATP of ST in CC were inﬂuenced by pH shifts ( 6.17 -- 7.35 ) . 
These parameters increased or decreased consistently with the corresponding alternation in pH. Data suggested that as pH decreased , ST consumption of glucose was reduced which implies reduced physiological capacity of ST at low pH. The observations in our study suggest that pH even in a fairly narrow range could be an important component of microenvironmental stimuli that regulate Salmonella growth physiology .
