A mutant gyrA allele resulting in an A271E substitution in the DNA gyrase protein generated a strain unable to grow on the C4-dicarboxylates succinate , malate , and fumarate . 
Bacteria harboring gyrA751 displayed decreased negative supercoiling in cells . 
Expression of the dctA gene , which encodes the C4-dicarboxylate transporter , was reduced in a gyrA751 mutant , providing the ﬁrst evidence that dctA expression is supercoiling sensitive and uncovering a simple metabolic screen for lesions in gyrase that reduce negative supercoiling . 
DNA supercoiling is implicated in genome dynamics affecting processes such as DNA replication , gene expression , and phage genome integration ( 4 , 20 ) . 
DNA gyrase , an ATP-de-pendent enzyme encoded by the essential genes gyrA and gyrB , is the only known bacterial topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils ( 13 ) . 
Perturbing DNA gyrase via mutations or antibiotics results in reduced growth rates and altered gene expression and can lead to cell death as a result of aberrant DNA supercoiling ( 15 , 27 , 28 ) . 
Many studies on gyrA have identiﬁed mutant alleles that confer resistance to speciﬁc antibiotics but few alleles with easily screened metabolic phenotypes . 
This work reports the identiﬁcation of an allele of gyrA in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that results in a mutant gyrase ( A271E ) and generates a strong metabolic phenotype . 
Strains carrying the mutant gyrase ( A271E ) are defective in C4-dicarboxylate transport mediated by DctA . 
The dctA gene encodes the aerobically expressed transporter for succinate , malate , and fumarate and is catabolite ( cyclic AMP receptor protein ) and anaerobically ( ArcA ) repressed ( 9 ) . 
This is the ﬁrst report of the strong inﬂuence of DNA supercoiling on dctA expression sufﬁcient to generate a clear metabolic defect and provides a means to identify mutant strains with decreased negative supercoiling . 
An allele of gyrA prevents growth on succinate , malate , and fumarate . 
In the course of other work , a mutant strain unable to utilize succinate ( Fig. 1 ) as a sole carbon source for growth was isolated following mutagenesis by diethyl sulfate ( 11 ) . 
Representative growth data are shown in Fig. 1 . 
An otherwise wild-type strain carrying the causative lesion ( gyrA751 , as described below ) was surveyed for growth on a variety of carbon sources . 
Nearly wild-type growth of the mutant strain was observed on the majority of carbon sources tested , including glucose , gluconate , galactose , glycerol , fructose , mannitol , acetate , and citrate ( data not shown ) . 
However , similar to succinate , neither malate nor fumarate supported growth at 30 , 37 , or 42 °C .

cycle intermediates ( e.g. , citrate and acetate ) indicated that the causative lesion was not in a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme . 
A Tn10d ( Tc ) insertion mutation linked by P22 to the caus-ative mutation was identiﬁed with standard techniques ( 18 ) . 
In a transductional cross using a donor pool of Tn10d ( Tc ) insertions , 36 of 18,000 Tcr transductants had gained the ability to grow on succinate . 
The linkage of these insertions to the caus-ative mutation was determined . 
The location of one insertion [ rcsC71 : : Tn10d ( Tc ) ] , subsequently shown to be 56 % linked to the succinate-negative phenotype , was identiﬁed by degenerate sequencing ( 5 ) . 
A genetic map of the region surrounding rcsC is shown in Fig. 2A . 
When used as donors in transduction crosses , strains with insertions in rcsB , yojN , apbE , ompC , STM2273 , STM2274 , or STM2275 generated two phenotypic classes ( Suc and Suc ) when the succinate-negative mutant was the recipient . 
Since sequence analyses determined that the relevant insertions were located internal to open reading frames ( ORFs ) , they were assumed to eliminate gene function . 
Because these insertions neither eliminated nor caused the succinate-negative phenotype , it was concluded that the caus-ative mutation was not an allele of the eight genes mentioned above . 
Because of its location in the relevant region , the gyrA gene was PCR ampliﬁed and sequenced from strains isogenic for the causative lesion ( i.e. , phenotypically Suc or Suc ) . 
Compared to the wild-type sequence , the mutant strain carried a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 811 of the gyrA gene . 
This mutation resulted in the substitution of a glutamic acid for an alanine at residue 271 ( A271E ) in the gyrase protein . 
This residue is conserved in 26/41 gyrase homologs from diverse bacteria analyzed by standard BLAST analyses ( 1 ) . 
The A271E form of gyrase results in reduced negative supercoiling but not quinolone resistance . 
The majority of alleles of gyrA that have been described were identiﬁed because they resulted in resistance to the quinolone class of antibiotics , such as nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid , though a few gyrA alleles ( hisW ) were isolated as regulatory mutants of the his operon ( 2 , 26 ) . 
Numerous mutations in gyrA resulting in quinolone resistance have been sequenced , and a well-described quino-lone resistance-determining region spans residues 51 to 106 ( 12 , 29 ) . 
Residue 271 does not fall in this region ( Fig. 2B ) , so the demonstration that the gyrA751 allele did not affect sensitivity to nalidixic acid or oxolinic acid was not surprising ( data not shown ) . 
In fact , residue 271 is in a region of the gyrase protein where no previous mutations have been reported . 
The expression of a number of genes is affected by supercoiling , and therefore , aberrant expression of these genes occurs when DNA supercoiling has been altered by a gyr mutation ( s ) or by addition of various drugs , in particular quinolones and coumarins ( 15 , 28 ) . 
Transcriptional fusions in a number of genes ( hisD9953 : : MudJ , trp-3615 : : MudJ , and ilvD2654 : : MudJ ) were moved by P22 transduction into strains with and without the gyrA751 allele . 
The resulting pairs of strains were assayed for - galactosidase activity , and the results are shown in Table 1 . 
The gyrA751 mutation increased expression of the his operon fourfold under repressing conditions ( e.g. , Luria broth ) and prevented the normal sevenfold derepression of the ilv operon under inducing conditions ( deﬁned medium with limiting , branched-chain amino acids ) . 
Conversely , no effect on expression of the trp operon was observed under growth conditions expected to either induce or repress the operon . 
Deregulation of the his and ilv operons , but not the trp operon , has been reported for cells with reduced negative supercoiling ( e.g. , the hisW class of alleles ) ( 8 , 10 , 27 ) . 
As predicted from the derepression of the his operon , strain DM8306 ( gyrA751 ) formed wrinkled colonies on medium with 2 % glucose and was resistant to the histidine analog amino triazole ( 22 , 27 ) . 
Both of these phenotypes are reported for hisW and hisU ( alleles of gyrB that result in similar consequences ) alleles ( 27 ) . 
Together , these results suggest that the A271E substitution in GyrA , similar to the hisW allele class , decreases negative supercoiling and that the decreased supercoiling alters the transcription of the expected loci . 
The gyrA751 mutant strain is deﬁcient in extrachromosomal DNA maintenance and supercoiling . 
Plasmid DNA ( pSU19 ) ( 3 ) was isolated with a commercial product ( Promega , Madison , WI ) from 109 CFU of strains isogenic for the gyrA751 or gyrA alleles . 
The yield of plasmid DNA was consistently lower from the gyrA751 mutant than from the wild-type strain ( 1.1 0.32 versus 5.1 0.75 g , respectively ) , though both strains were grown in the same medium . 
The plasmid DNA isolated from a gyrA751 mutant was transformed into a wild-type strain . 
Subsequent isolation of the plasmid DNA conﬁrmed that the

Repressing conditions represent growth in Luria broth , while inducing conditions indicate growth in no-carbon E medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose , 1 mM MgSO4 , and relevant amino acids at the following concentrations : Ile , Leu , Val , 60 M each ; Trp , 50 M . 
The last column displays the ratio of transcription found in the mutant to that of the wild-type genetic background . 
plasmid had reestablished itself to wild-type levels , indicating that the gyrA751 mutant inefﬁciently maintained episomal DNA . 
Although it was formally possible that the gyrA751 mutant was unable to maintain only pSU19 , a similar result was obtained when pBR322 was isolated from isogenic strains . 
Since plasmids pSU19 and pBR322 have different origins of replication , it was concluded that the gyrA751 mutant was in general unable to efﬁciently maintain plasmids . 
In a different study , gyrase inhibitors such as novobiocin were shown to promote plasmid curing , implicating a role for supercoiling in plasmid maintenance , which would be consistent with the interpretation of the data above ( 14 ) . 
To measure directly the extent of plasmid supercoiling , the pSU19 topoisomers were separated by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel containing chloroquine ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The topoisomer mobility of plasmid DNA isolated from the gyrA751 mutant was visibly decreased , con-ﬁrming that the gyrA751 mutant strain maintained a lower level of DNA supercoiling . 
Decreased dctA expression is responsible for the succinate-negative phenotype of gyrA751 . 
Since the gyrA751 allele caused multiple transcriptional changes , it was hypothesized that the inability of the gyrA751 mutant to grow on C4-dicarboxylates was due to reduced expression of a gene ( s ) required for C4-dicarboxylate utilization . 
Similar to the gyrA751 mutant , strains lacking dctA are unable to grow with malate , fumarate , or succinate as a carbon source ( 17 ) . 
DctA is an inner membrane permease responsible for transporting these three dicarboxylic acids during aerobic growth conditions ( 19 , 25 ) . 
To determine whether the growth behavior of a gyrA751 mutant was consistent with a reduction in DctA activity , transport assays were performed . 
Cells were harvested from media containing 24 mM glycerol ( as a carbon source ) and 16 mM succinate ( to induce transport ) , and the rates of [ 2,3-14C ] succinic acid transport in a pair of strains isogenic for the gyrA or gyrA751 allele are shown in Fig. 4 . 
The rate of succinate uptake by the gyrA751 mutant was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the wildtype strain and in fact was not signiﬁcantly higher than that of a dctA mutant . 
That the gyrA751 mutant was strongly deﬁcient in DctA activity was consistent with the succinate-negative growth phenotype . 
To determine whether the transcriptional expression of the dctA gene was reduced in a gyrA751 mutant background , a lacZ operon fusion ( MudJ ) in dctA was isolated from a pool of random MudJ insertions . 
The dctA81 : : MudJ insertion was transduced into strains with or without the gyrA751 mutation , and the resulting strains were assayed for - galactosidase activity . 
Expression of dctA was twofold lower in the gyr mutant than in the wild-type strain ( 163 5 versus 358 22 Miller units , respectively ) , indicating that the dctA promoter is sensitive to supercoiling . 
The relatively small effect on transcription was surprising given the large effect of the gyrA751 mutation on both the phenotype and DctA-dependent transport . 
It had previously been noted that inactivation of dctA with a lacZ fusion caused constitutive expression of dctA and suggested that DctA might be autoregulatory ( 9 ) , thus complicating the interpretation of the fusion data . 
Total cellular RNA was isolated ( RNeasy ; QIAGEN ) from gyrA751 or gyrA isogenic strains cultured in 24 mM glycerol , 16 mM fumarate in midlogarithmic phase , and reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described ( 7 ) . 
The levels of dctA mRNA were determined in at least two isolates of isogenic strains and were normalized to trp mRNA levels as a control . 
The amount of dctA mRNA was 13-fold lower in the gyrA751 strain than in the wild-type strain ( 2,896 4,007 versus 38,298 2,922 arbitrary units , respectively ) , demonstrating that dctA expression is strongly regulated by the extent of DNA supercoiling . 
Conclusion . 
The data herein identify dctA as a locus whose transcription is sensitive to levels of DNA supercoiling . 
Further , a temperature-insensitive allele of the essential gyrA gene that decreased supercoiling yet did not inﬂuence the sensitivity of the strain to growth inhibition by quinolones was identiﬁed . 
Visualization of the relevant A271 residue in the crystal structure of the breakage-reunion domain of GyrA ( GyrA59 ) ( 21 ) reveals that this residue is in the 11 helix that is proximal to , but not in , the quinolone resistance-determining region and catalytic tyrosine region . 
To the best of our knowledge , no mutations in the 11 helix have been reported , and the importance of the 11 helix for protein function remains to be determined biochemically . 
The proximity of the 11 helix to the catalytic site might suggest that the A271 residue has a role in DNA recognition or catalysis . 
This work has identiﬁed a simple metabolic screen ( the inability to grow on succinate ) for the isolation of alleles and other genes that result in gyrA reduced supercoiling .
