ABSTRACT 
A phage replication -- competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( PR-cELISA ) was developed for the detection of multiple antibiotic -- resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 . 
In the PR-cELISA procedure , a phage , BP1 , was inoculated into a log-phase bacterial culture at a ratio of 1:100 . 
After a 3-h incubation of the mixture , BP1 replication was measured by cELISA based on the competitive binding between BP1 and biotinylated BP1 to Salmonella Typhimurium smooth lipopoly-saccharide . 
Among the 84 Salmonella strains and 9 non-Salmonella strains that were tested by PR-cELISA , BP1 detected 39 of 40 Salmonella Typhimurium strains , 2 of 10 Salmonella non-Typhimurium somatic group B strains , and 5 of 18 Salmonella somatic group D1 strains . 
With the addition of chloramphenicol to the culture medium , PR-cELISA detected all 27 multiple antibiotic -- resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and none of the other Salmonella strains or non-Salmonella strains tested . 
The results demonstrated that PR-cELISA has potential applications for the detection of multiple antibiotic -- resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 . 
Multiple antibiotic -- resistant Salmonella enterica sero-var Typhimurium deﬁnitive type 104 ( MAR DT104 ) emerged as a world health problem in the mid-1980s , and over the last two decades the incidence of its infection in humans and animals continuously increased in Europe and North America ( 1 , 6 , 15 ) . 
Most of MAR DT104 isolates demonstrated resistance to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfonamides , and tetracycline ( R-type ACSSuT ) and were widely distributed in humans , most meat-producing animals , exotic birds , and various foods , including meat , dairy products , and salad ingredients ( 14 ) . 
Rapid detection methods speciﬁc for this pathogen are critical in any strategies to control its spread . 
Recently , phages ( also called bacteriophages ) have been used as biological agents for rapid detection of bacteria due to their speciﬁc host range of adsorption and rep-lication . 
Target bacteria were detected based on the adsorption of ﬂuorescent-labelled phages by microscopy or cytometry ( 5 , 11 ) or based on the phage replication . 
The rep-lication-based methods involve enumerating phage by plaque assay ( 12 ) or mass spectrometry ( 9 ) , measuring enzymatic activities released from bacteria by phage lytic action ( 2 , 10 , 13 , 16 ) , or monitoring the expression of reporter genes introduced into the target bacteria by phages ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) . 
The aim of the present study was to develop an assay for the detection of MAR Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 using a lytic phage BP1 that was isolated from swine fecal samples . 
BP1 replication was more speciﬁc than its adsorption for detection of Salmonella Typhimurium , and a BP1 replication-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( cELISA ) was developed . 
The cELISA provided a high-throughput platform for measuring BP1 replication based on the competition of BP1 and biotinylated BP1 for binding to Salmonella Typhimurium smooth lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
With the addition of chloramphenicol into the culture medium for BP1 replication , phage replication ( PR ) -- cELISA was found to be speciﬁc for the MAR DT104 strains tested .

this study are shown in Table 1 and include strains from the culture collection of the Ottawa Laboratory Fallowﬁeld and the Ottawa Laboratory Carling of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) , and the Health Canada Laboratory ( Guelph , Ontario , Canada ) . 
Phage BP1 was isolated by Biophage Pharma Inc. ( Montreal , Québec , Canada ) from a swine farm in the province of Québec . 
BP1 had a 63-nm head , a tail measuring 111 by 7 nm with terminal spikes , and a double-stranded DNA genome .

The membrane ﬁlters were then examined at a magniﬁcation of 31,250 using an Olympus BX 51 epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a green ﬂuorescent protein ﬁlter set ( Olympus , Melville , N.Y. ) . 
More than 10 ﬁelds in each ﬁlter were examined . 
Each bacterial strain was tested twice , and controls containing only the immunomagnetic beads and no bacteria were included . 
monella Typhimurium DT104 strain SA 97-0963 was used as the bacterial host to replicate BP1 . 
Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( 250 ml ; Fisher Scientiﬁc , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) containing SA 97-0963 at 5 3 107 CFU/ml and BP1 at 5 3 105 PFU/ml was incubated overnight at 378C with 250 rpm shaking . 
Extraction , concentration , and puriﬁcation of BP1 were performed as described by Goodridge et al. ( 5 ) . 
The puriﬁed BP1 was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ; 0.32 g/liter NaH2PO4 , 1.1 g/liter Na2HPO4 , 8.5 g/liter NaCl , pH 7.2 ) and was biotinylated with a Biotin Labeling Kit ( Roche Diagnostics Canada , Laval , Québec , Canada ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
In brief , 1 ml of BP1 suspension ( 5.0 3 1011 PFU/ml ) was mixed with 10 ml of the biotin stock ( 20 mg/ml ) . 
The mixture was stirred gently at room temperature for 2 h and then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column . 
After the column was washed with 1.5 ml PBS , biotinylated BP1 ( B-BP1 ) was eluted with 3.5 ml PBS . 
The fractions with optical density at 280 nm ( OD280 ) values higher than 0.4 were collected , pooled , and stored at 48C . 
The concentration of B-BP1 was determined with the traditional double-layer plaque-forming assay . 
PR-cELISA . 
Single colonies from cultures of various bacterial strains were inoculated in LB broth and grown to log phase in 2 h . 
The cultures were standardzed to an OD600 of 0.5 by dilution with LB broth as necessary . 
Bacteria ( 5 3 106 CFU ) and BP1 ( 5 3 104 PFU ) were inoculated into 1 ml of fresh LB broth with or without supplement of 32 mg/ml chloramphenicol . 
Controls containing only bacteria and no BP1 were included . 
The mixture was incubated at 378C for 3 h with 200 rpm shaking . 
The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 5 min to remove the bacterial debris , and the supernatant was subjected to plaqueforming assay and cELISA as described below . 
Salmonella Typhimurium smooth LPS ( 1.0 mg/ml ; cat . 
no . 
L6511 , Sigma , St. Louis , Mo. ) in 100 ml 13 coating solution ( cat . 
no. 50-84-01 , Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories [ KPL ] , Gaithersburg , Md. ) was used to coat microtitration plates ( Maxisorp , cat . 
no. 446612 , Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) overnight at 48C . 
The plates were then blocked with 100 ml 13 blocking solution ( cat . 
no. 50-61-01 , KPL ) for 1 h at room temperature , and then washed three times using 13 wash solution ( cat . 
no. 50-63-01 , KPL ) . 
Culture supernatant ( 100 ml ) of each bacterial strain with or with out BP1 was added to duplicate plate wells . 
Positive ( BP1 at 2.5 3 109 PFU/ml in LB broth ) and negative ( uninoculated LB broth ) controls were added to quadruplicate plate wells . 
The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times . 
B-BP1 suspension ( 100 ml , 2.5 3 109 PFU/ml ) in 13 diluent solution ( cat . 
no. 50-61-01 , KPL ) was added to the plate wells . 
The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature , and then washed three times . 
To monitor the competitive binding between BP1 and B-BP1 to Salmonella Typhimurium smooth LPS , 100 ml of streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate ( 25 mU/ml , Roche Diagnostics Canada ) in 13 diluent solution was added to the wells . 
Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature , the plates were washed three times , and 100 ml 3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) peroxidase substrate ( cat . 
no. 52-00-00 , KPL ) was added to the wells . 
The plates were then incubated 15 min in the dark at room temperature , and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 ml of TMB stop solution ( cat . 
no. 50-85-05 , KPL ) . 
The OD450 was read by ELISA plate reader ( Multiskan , ThermoLabSystems , Helsinki , Finland ) . 
Plates were considered valid if the negative control wells had an average OD of .0.700 , and the positive 450 control wells had an average OD of 0.300 to 0.500 . 
A per-450 centage of inhibition value was calculated using the following equation for each sample : % Inhibition where OD of the sample is the mean value of two wells , and OD of the negative control is the mean value of four wells .

RESULTS
sorption assay , 47 of 50 somatic group B strains , 18 of 18 group D1 strains , and the single group A strain were positive . 
All nine non-Salmonella strains and all 15 Salmonella strains from somatic groups E4 , E1 , C1 , C2 -- C3 , and D2 were negative ( Table 1 ) . 
Based on BP1 adsorption to somatic receptors of Sal-monella Typhimurium , both smooth and rough Salmonella Typhimurium LPS were evaluated as a BP1 receptor by ELISA . 
As BP1 adsorbed to the smooth LPS but not to the rough LPS ( data not presented ) , smooth Salmonella Typhi-murium LPS was used as a BP1 capture reagent to coat the microtitration plates for developing a cELISA to measure BP1 replication level . 
Various concentrations of the smooth LPS and B-BP1 were tested for production of an OD great-er than 1.2 with minimum B-BP1 , and 1.0 mg/ml of the smooth LPS and 2.5 3 109 PFU/ml of the B-BP1 were chosen for the cELISA . 
When this cELISA condition was 8 used , BP1 at a concentration of 5 3 10 PFU/ml or higher competed strongly with B-BP1 and produced an average inhibition greater than 50 % . 
When the BP1 concentration was reduced to 5.0 3 107 PFU/ml or lower , the inhibition decreased to 14.2 % or lower ( Fig. 2 ) . 
BP1 showed excellent replication capabilities at 378C as well as at room temperature ( data not presented ) . 
A strong inhibition in the c-ELISA was observed after a 3-h or longer incubation of 5 3 104 PFU/ml BP1 in a log-phase Salmonella Typhimu-rium culture at 5 3 106 CFU/ml ( Fig. 3 ) , and the increase of inhibition in the cELISA corresponded to BP1 replication ( data not presented ) . 
A 3-h incubation of 5.0 3 106 CFU/ml of each test bacterium and 5.0 3 104 PFU/ml of BP1 were used in PR-cELISA for screening of 93 bacterial strains , and the screening results were veriﬁed by the plaque-forming assay . 
BP1 replicated in 39 of 40 Typhimurium strains , 2 of 10 non-Typhimurium somatic group B strains , and 5 of 18 group D1 strains tested by PR-cELISA ( Table 1 ) . 
None of the other Salmonella strains or non-Salmonella strains tested were positive . 
The positive strains produced an average inhibition of 68.5 % ( 66.6 % ) , and the average inhibition o the negative strains was 4.5 % ( 63.9 % ) in RP-cELISA . 
To improve the speciﬁcity of the assay for detection of MAR DT104 , chloramphenicol was added to the culture to inhibit the growth of nonresistant strains , and only the MAR DT104 strains with the R-type ACSSuT pattern were positive using PR-cELISA ( Table 1 ) .

DISCUSSION
The use of Salmonella Typhimurium smooth LPS as a BP1 capture reagent in the cELISA resulted in little interference of the test culture with the assay and allowed direct testing of culture supernatant without further treatment . 
Based on the competitive binding between BP1 and B-BP1 to the smooth LPS , the cELISA provides a high-throughput platform for measuring BP1 replication level . 
Because the concentration of BP1 used as the inoculum was well below the cELISA detection level , the percent inhibition results could clearly distinguish positive and negative strains by measuring the BP1 replication after a 3-h incubation of the test culture . 
BP1 recognition of Salmonella Typhimurium LPS O antigen was demonstrated by both the ﬂuorescent phage adsorption assay and the PR-cELISA . 
The PR-c-ELISA detected 39 of 40 Typhimurium strains and 7 of 44 non-Typhimurium Salmonella strains . 
In comparison , the phage adsorption assay detected 40 of 40 Typhimurium strains and 26 of 44 non-Typhimurium Salmonella strains . 
PR-cELISA provided more speciﬁc detection of Typhimu-rium strains than the adsorption assay , as more sophisticated interactions with the host were required for phage rep-lication than for phage adsorption ( 3 ) . 
Addition of chlor-amphenicol to the culture medium allowed PR-cELISA to identify chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella Typhimu-rium strains . 
However , most of such strains isolated in the last two decades were indeed MAR DT104 strains with the R-type ACSSuT pattern ( 6 ) . 
Thus , in combination with selective bacterial enrichment , the PR-cELISA would have potential diagnostic applications for the detection of mul-tidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 in food and environmental samples .
