Abstract : The use of biosafety level 3 pathogens is an essential element of education and training at medical schools . 
We previously reported on invasion-defective strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , GTC 3P408 ( invA , sipB ) and GTC 3P409 ( invA , sipB , and viaB ) , as candidates for use in educational programs . 
Vi negative strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi became extremely sensitive to complement attack but showed increased invasiveness . 
Therefore , this study was conducted to construct two virulence-defective strains , GTC 3P460 ( invA , sipB , and rpoS ) and GTC 3P461 ( invA , sipB , viaB , and rpoS ) , of S. enterica serovar Typhi by deleting rpoS from the GTC 3P409 and GTC 3P408 strains . 
Stress tests demonstrated that GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 are sensitive to conditions of starvation , acid stress and oxidative stress . 
These results suggest that these virulence-defective strains have difﬁculty surviving in the gastric environment and in macrophages , characteristics that make them ideal candidates for education at level 2 facilities . 
Colony morphology and conventional biochemical features of these strains are identical to the parent strain S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU 10007 .

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , a typical enteropathogen that can cause systemic infections in humans , is classiﬁed as a biosafety level 3 pathogen ( 1 ) . 
A recent investigation of educational microbiological experiments in Japan revealed that S. enterica serovar Typhi is not commonly used in most medical schools due to a lack of level 3 facilities . 
In a previous study , we prepared virulence-defective mutants of S. enterica serovar Typhi as candidates for educational purposes ( 16 ) . 
This report details the construction of virulence-defective strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi with enhanced safety features for use in a teaching environment . 
RpoS is a sigma subunit of RNA polymerase that has been identiﬁed in Escherichia , Salmonella , and other enteric and related pathogens ( 7 ) . 
Recent studies have shown that rpoS and RpoS-dependent genes are

E-mail : tezaki@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp induced not only in stationary phase but also in many different stress conditions ; a response that provides cells with the ability to survive the actual stressor ( 2 , 5 , 6 , 15 ) . 
A number of virulence factors are included in the large regulatory network of more than 70 genes controlled by RpoS ( 11 ) . 
The Vi capsular polysaccharide of S. enterica serovar Typhi is a virulence factor that enables evasion of phagocytosis and inhibition of complement activity . 
However , mutants with a deletion of the Vi antigen are more invasive than the wild strain ( 13 , 18 ) . 
Two inva-sion-defective strains , GTC 3P409 ( invA , sipB ) and GTC 3P408 ( invA , sipB , and viaB ) , were created by deleting the invA and sipB invasion genes from the wild strain GTC 3P91 ( GIFU 10007 ) and the Vi-nega-tive strain GTC 3P99 ( GIFU 10388 ) ( 16 ) . 
In this study , rpoS is deleted from the invasion-defective strains ( GTC 3P409 and GTC 3P408 ) to decrease their pathogenicity . 
Since these new mutants retain the features and biochemical traits of the parental strain , they are suitable candidates for use in educational experiments .

Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains . 
A wild strain of S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU 10007 and a Vi-negative mutant strain GIFU 10388 ( 4 ) , recorded as GTC 3P91 and GTC 3P99 ( viaB ) respectively , were used in this study . 
The inva-sion-defective strains derived from GTC 3P91 and GTC 3P99 , GTC 3P408 ( invA , sipB ) and GTC 3P409 ( invA , sipB , and viaB ) , were used for the construction of rpoS-deleted , virulence-defective strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
E. coli SY372λpir was used to clone the pGMB151 suicide plasmid , which contained the homologous rpoS-defective DNA fragment used to inactivate the rpoS gene of target strains . 
Construction of virulence-defective rpoS deletion strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
An 800-bp homologous rpoS-defective fragment was prepared as previously described ( 12 ) , in which 559 bp of the rpoS gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi were deleted before insertion into the pGBM151 suicide plasmid . 
The plasmid was then transformed into competent GTC 3P408 and GTC 3P409 cells by electroporation . 
After selection on LB plates with ampicillin and streptomycin , bacteria were selected by incubation on LB plates ( 15 ) with 5 % sucrose . 
Bacterial recombination was conﬁrmed by PCR with rpoS speciﬁc primers ( 12 ) . 
Finally , complete recombinants were veriﬁed as rpoS deletion mutants by sequencing the rpoS gene . 
The rpoS mutant strain of GTC 3P408 , named GTC 3P460 , is a triple mutant that is negative for the invA , sipB , and rpoS genes . 
The GTC 3P461 strain derived from GTC 3P408 is a quadruple mutant that is negative for invA , sipB , viaB and rpoS . 
Starvation test . 
The GTC 3P91 , GTC 3P99 , GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 strains were incubated in LB medium ( pH 7.0 ) at 37 C for 24 hr to stationary phase . 
The cells were then harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in M9 medium ( 15 ) , and continually incubated at 37 C. Each day a small volume of bacterial solution was removed , diluted with M9 medium and incubated on LB plates . 
Bacterial clones on the plates were counted for the calculation of survival rates . 
Oxidative stress test . 
Two methods were used in the examination of oxidative stress . 
In the ﬁrst , 100 ml of stationary phase bacteria that had been preincubated in LB medium were harvested by centrifugation , washed with saline buffer and equally separated into four tubes . 
The bacterial cells were then suspended in LB medium with 0.9 mM , 3 mM , 9 mM , and 30 mM of H2O2 . 
Survival was checked after a 10 min incubation at 37 C . 
In the second method , the pre-incubated bacteria were harvested by centrifugation , washed with saline buffer , resuspended in LB broth with 10 mM of H2O2 and continually incubated at 37 C. Samples were collected at 5 min , 10 min , 15 min and 20 min time points during incubation . 
Survival rates were assessed by diluting the bacterial solutions 103 - to 105-fold with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7.4 ) , plating on LB plates and incubating for 24 hr . 
Bacterial clones on the plates were counted for the calculation of survival rates . 
Acid tolerance test . 
Stationary phase bacteria were resuspended in citrate buffer ( pH 3.0 ) and continually incubated at 37 C. Samples were collected at 15 min , 30 min , 45 min and 60 min time points during incubation . 
Survival was checked by diluting with a 100-fold volume of PBS ( pH 7.4 ) , plating on LB and incubating at 37 C for 24 hr . 
The survival rates of bacteria were calculated based on the number of clones on the plates .

Results
Strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 Were Sensitive to Starvation The results of the starvation assay are shown in Fig. 1 . 
Due to the absence of the Vi capsular antigen , GTC 3P99 was much more sensitive to starvation conditions than the wild strain GTC 3P91 . 
Survival declined by approximately 80 % during the ﬁrst day in starvation conditions . 
The susceptibility to starvation of GTC 3P461 was higher than in the other three strains , but only slightly higher than that of GTC 3P99 . 
Susceptibility of the GTC 3P460 strain was also higher than in wild strain cells , though lower than the susceptibility of the Vi-negative strain GTC 3P99 . 
These data show that the deletion of rpoS led to an increase in susceptibility to starvation in virulence-defective strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
Fig. 2 . 
Survival of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi under oxidative stress . 
Bacterial strains were incubated in LB broth ( pH 7.0 ) overnight . 
Oxidative stress was induced by the addition of H2O2 . 
Survival was assessed by incubation of the bacterial culture on LB plates after 103 -- 105-fold dilutions with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) . 
A. Strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi were incubated in LB broth ( pH 7.0 ) with 0.9 mM , 3 mM , 9 mM , and 30 mM H2O2 at 37 C for 10 min . 
B. Bacterial strains were incubated in LB broth ( pH 7.0 ) with 10 mM H2O2 within 20 min and survival of the bacteria was monitored at 5 min intervals 
Strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 Were Sensitive to Oxidative Stress The results of the oxidative stress tests are shown in Fig. 2 . 
After incubation with different concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min , the survival rate of GTC 3P91 , the wild strain , was not signiﬁcantly decreased by concentrations of H2O2 of less than 9.0 mM . 
The survival rate of GTC 3P99 was greatly decreased upon incubation with concentrations of H2O2 over 3.0 mM . 
The survival rates of GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 were greatly reduced by H2O2 concentrations over 0.9 mM ( Fig. 2A ) . 
After incubation in LB broth with 10 mM H2O2 , the survival rate of the wild strain GTC 3P91 cells mildly decreased within 20 min . 
However , the survival rates of GTC 3P99 , GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 sharply declined after 5 min ( Fig. 2B ) . 
These results suggest that the virulence-defective strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 are sensitive to conditions of oxidative stress . 
Strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 Were Sensitive to Acid Stress Incubation in citrate buffer ( pH 4.0 ) for 60 min did not obviously affect the survival rates of GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 when compared with the wild strain GTC 3P91 ( data not shown ) . 
However , when incubation occurred in citrate buffer ( pH 3.0 ) for 60 min , the survival rates of GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 were much less than that of GTC 3P91 ( Fig. 3 ) , which was at 90 % after 15 min and remained at over 50 % at 60 min . 
The survival rates of GTC 3P99 , GTC 3P460 , and GTC 3P461 dropped below 50 % within 15 min , and were less than 10 % at 60 min . 
These results suggest that S. enterica serovar Typhi strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 are sensitive to acidic conditions at pH 3.0 , and that their ability to adapt to the gastric environment of the host would be compromised . 
Discussion
Strains GTC 3P408 and GTC 3P409 are invasiondefective strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in which the invA and sipB genes have been deleted ( 18 ) . 
RpoS is a sigma factor that regulates the expression of many other genes . 
At least 70 genes are known to be regulated by RpoS , with many more probably still to be found ( 6 , 11 ) . 
Moreover , the functions of RpoS and the known RpoS-regulated genes are not completely understood ( 11 ) . 
Though the rpoS-deleted strain of S. enterica serovar Typhi exhibited low cytotoxicity in our previous work ( 12 ) , the safety of rpoS-deleted virulence-defective strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 was checked in this work to ensure their suitability for use in a teaching laboratory . 
The starvation test results indicate that the susceptibilities of strains GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 are higher than the susceptibility of wild strain . 
The oxidative stress tests showed that Vi-negative strains are more susceptible than Vi-positive strains , and that the rpoS deletion increases the vulnerability in S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
In addition , the acid stress test showed that the GTC 3P460 and GTC 3P461 strains are sensitive to an acidic environment of pH 3.0 and can not adapt to the gastric acid environment . 
The cytotoxic activity of these two strains was also checked , and revealed an absence of cytotoxic activity to human blood macrophages after inoculation in culture medium ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , the results demonstrate that these virulence-defective , rpoS-deletion strains are much safer than wild strain S. enterica serovar Typhi due to an impairment of their ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells , less capable of surviving in the starvation and gastric environments and in the active macrophages of the host . 
The Vi antigen of S. enterica serovar Typhi is a monopolymer of a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) formed from N-acetyl-galactosamine and uronic acid . 
This LPS covers the cell surface and is important for survival in macrophages ( 6 , 9 , 12 , 14 ) . 
InvA and SipB , whose genes are located on the Salmonella pathogenic island-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhi , are important for invasion of intestinal epithelial cells ( 3 , 8 ) . 
Because Vi-negative strains are hyperinvasive , invA and sipB were inactivated in the GTC 3P409 strain ( 18 ) . 
In the present study , the rpoS gene was deleted from GTC 3P409 to form the virulence-defective GTC 3P461 strain , which has proved to be much safer than GTC 3P409 , and can be used in a variety of microbiological experiments . 
For example , because the viaB deletion leads to high ﬂagellar expression , this strain can be used for the H antigen test , the mortality test , the staining of ﬂagella and molecular tests of ﬂagellin . 
It can also be used for morphological studies , colony observations on SS agar plates and biochemical tests . 
The Vi antigen is the distinguishing characteristic of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
Therefore , GTC 3P460 was constructed using an invasion-defective strain and an rpoS deletion for investigations that use the Vi antigen in staining and serological tests . 
From the results of this study , though the GTC 3P460 strain is deemed less safe than GTC 3P461 , it is far safer than the wild strain S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU 10007 , and can be considered a candidate for use in serological testing of the Vi antigen and for Vi capsule staining . 
The genotypes and characteristics and the applicability of each mutant for use in a particular assay is summarized in Table 1 . 
All of these strains are presented as possible resources for some use in laboratory instruction . 
Selective use of these organisms will greatly increase the safety of using S. enterica serovar Typhi in educational experiments .
