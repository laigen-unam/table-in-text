The 5 - untranslated region ( 5 UTR ) of the ﬂiC ﬂagellin gene of Salmonella contains sequences critical for efﬁcient ﬂiC mRNA translation coupled to assembly . 
In a previous study we used targeted mutagenesis of the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene to isolate single base changes defective in ﬂiC gene translation . 
This identiﬁed a predicted stem-loop structure , SL2 , as an effector of normal ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
A single base change ( 38C : U ) in the ﬂiC 5 UTR resulted in a mutant that is defective in ﬂiC mRNA translation and was chosen for this study . 
Motile ( Mot ) revertants of the 38C : T mutant were isolated and characterized , yielding several unexpected results . 
Second-site suppressors that restored ﬂiC translation and motility included mutations that disrupt a RNA duplex stem formed between RNA sequences in the ﬂiC 5 UTR SL2 region ( including a precise deletion of SL2 ) and bases early within the ﬂiC-coding region . 
A stop codon mutation at position 80 of ﬂgM also suppressed the 38C : T motility defect , while ﬂgM mutants defective in anti- 28 activity had no effect on ﬂiC translation . 
One remarkable mutation in the ﬂiC 5 UTR ( 15G : A ) results in a translation defect by itself but , in combination with the 38C : U mutation , restores normal translation . 
These results suggests signals intrinsic to the ﬂiC mRNA that have both positive and negative effects on ﬂiC translation involving both RNA structure and interacting proteins . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possess 5 to 10 peritrichous ﬂagella that are utilized for motility ( 19 ) . 
The bacterial ﬂagellum is composed of three main substructures : ( i ) a basal body that transverses the cell membranes and acts a proton-driven rotary motor enabling the ﬂagellum to rotate and propel the bacterium through a liquid environment and across surfaces ; ( ii ) a hook that acts as ﬂexible coupling between the external ﬁlament and the basal body ; and ( iii ) a rigid , helical ﬁlament that typically extends up to 10 m from the cell surface and acts as a propeller . 
Flagellum assembly begins with the basal body , proceeds through the hook , and is completed by the ﬁlament ( 20 ) . 
The assembly of extracellular structures such as the ﬁlament and the hook involves the transport of the component proteins through a central channel within the growing ﬂagellum . 
The cost of the maintenance of a ﬂagellar motility system is high due to the large number of genes and protein subunits and the energy required for ﬂagellum synthesis and functioning , which is ca. 2 % of biosynthetic energy expenditure of the cell ( 19 ) . 
As a result , the ﬂagellar system of Salmonella is highly regulated at multiple levels , including responses to environmental cues and the developmental stages of the organelle ( 4 ) . 
The ﬂagellar biosynthetic and chemotaxis systems require more than 60 genes that are arranged into a transcriptional hierarchy of three promoter classes ( class 1 , class 2 , and class 3 ) whose expression corresponds to when their products are needed for assembly ( 16 ) . 
The class 1 ﬂhDC operon is the master control operon . 
Transcription from this promoter is inﬂuenced by a number of global regulatory signals

in a manner that is not fully understood ( 14 ) . 
The FlhD and FlhC proteins form a heterotetrameric complex that is required for the transcription of class 2 promoters upstream of the Middle genes ( 18 ) . 
Class 2 promoters mediate the transcription of genes necessary for the assembly and structure of the hook-basal body ( HBB ) complex in addition to the transcriptional regulators FlgM and FliA ( 28 ) . 
Class 3 promoters require 28-RNA polymerase for their transcription ( 23 ) . 
FlgM is an inhibitor of 28 and prevents class 3 transcription prior to completion of the HBB structure ( 13 , 15 ) . 
Upon HBB completion , FlgM is secreted outside of the cell resulting in a 28-dependent transcription from the class 3 promoters ( 13 ) . 
Class 3 promoters direct transcription of the ﬂgKL operon that encodes the hook-ﬁlament junction proteins , the ﬂiDST operon that encodes the ﬁlament cap ( FliD ) and the secretion chaperones FliS ( FliC chaperone ) and FliT ( FliD chaperone ) , the ﬂgMN operon encoding the anti- 28 factor FlgM and the secretion chaperone FlgN ( FlgK and FlgL chaperone ) , the ﬂagellin operons ﬂiC and ﬂjBA , the ﬂiAZY operon that encodes 28 ( ﬂiA ) , a regulator of class 2 transcription ( ﬂiZ ) , and a gene of unknown function ( ﬂiY ) ( 11 ) . 
In addition , class 3 promoters direct transcription of genes whose products are required for chemotaxis and ﬂagellar rotation . 
In Salmonella , little is known regarding the translational control mechanisms in ﬂagellin biosynthesis . 
The best-studied system is in the Caulobacter crescentus ﬂagellar system , where the FlbT protein has been discovered as a regulator of ﬂagellin gene translation translational . 
FlbT acts by directly binding the 5 untranslated region ( 5 UTR ) of ﬂagellin mRNA to inhibit its translation ( 2 ) . 
Recently , we found that transcription of the chromosomal ﬂiC gene without the ﬂiC 5 UTR region are nonmotile , suggesting an important role for the ﬂiC 5 UTR in normal ﬂiC mRNA expression associated with ﬁlament assembly ( 1 ) . 
The 5 end of the ﬂiC gene was analyzed , and regions essential for transcriptional and translational control were de-ﬁned . 
A stem-loop region , SL2 , of the ﬂiC 5 UTR was discovered that when mutated was defective in ﬂiC translation ( 1 ) . 
In the present study we isolated and characterized motile ( Mot ) revertants of a translation-defective mutant within a putative stem-loop structure , SL2 , of the ﬂiC 5 UTR ( 38C : U relative to the AUG start codon ) . 
This analysis led to the unexpected discovery that SL2 is an inhibitor of ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
In addition , suppressors identiﬁed the C-terminal 17 amino acids of FlgM and a region in the ﬂiC structural gene that codes for amino acids 13 and 14 that act to facilitate regulation of ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
A model is presented that suggests an interaction between the SL2 of the ﬂiC 5 UTR and the ﬂiC coding region , including the 3 base of amino acid codon 11 through the initial base of amino acid codon 15 . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth medium conditions . 
The bacterial strains used in the present study are listed in Table 1 . 
Strains were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium with aeration as described by Davis et al. ( 6 ) . 
Motility assay was performed in motility agar plates that consisted of 10 g of tryptone , 5 g of NaCl , and 0.3 % ( wt/vol ) agar per liter ( pH 7.4 ) . 
Plates were incubated at 37 °C . 
Minimal E salts medium supplemented with 0.2 % glucose was used as a minimal medium ( 28 ) . 
Indicator media included X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galacto-pyranoside ) , MacConkey-lactose ( Difco ) , and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) - lactose ( 17 ) . 
Green plates were made up as described previously ( 27 ) and used to isolate phage-free bacteria after transductions . 
Selection of tetracy-cline-sensitive ( Tcs ) clones was done on zinc-fusaric acid selection plates ( 21 ) . 
Strain construction . 
Markers were mobilized between Salmonella strains by generalized transduction using the mutant P22 bacteriophage HT105/int -201 ( 26 ) . 
The following antibiotics were used for resistance marker selections ( ﬁnal concentrations ) : ampicillin , 30 g/ml for chromosomal resistant gene expression or 100 g/ml for plasmid-encoded resistant gene expression ; chloramphenicol , 12.5 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 g/ml ; and tetracycline , 15 g/ml ( 21 ) . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
- Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate as described previously ( 21 ) . 
Cells were grown to a net Klett reading of 100 ( optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 ) prior to the assay . 
FliC immunoblotting . 
Immunoblots were performed in triplicate as described previously ( 12 ) . 
Samples were subjected to 10 % Tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . 
Blots were probed using an anti-FliC polyclonal antibody ( Difco ) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Nonradioactive ECL Plus Kit ( Amersham Biosciences ) was used for blot detection . 
Quantiﬁcation was performed with ImageQuant for the Macintosh ( IQ v1 .2 ; Molecular Dynamics ) . 
Protein levels were calculated as a percentage of the total protein at time t divided by the amount of protein at time zero and multiplied by 100 . 
Predicted RNA secondary structures . 
RNA secondary structures were predicted by using the M-FOLD program , which is available online ( 22 ) . 
We analyzed two different partial RNA secondary structures . 
One structure included the ﬂiC 1 translational start site and 12 nucleotides ( nt ) downstream the ATG start codon . 
The second structure included the ﬂiC 1 translational start site , the full length of the 5 UTR ( 62 nt ) and 42 nt downstream the ATG initiation codon . 
In the wild-type strain , TH6232 , the examined RNA total length was 77 nt for the ﬁrst structure and 108 nt for the second one . 
M-FOLD analyses were conducted at the ﬁxed temperature of 37 °C . 
In some cases more than one global folding pattern were displayed with an increase in the available free energy . 
Construction of transcriptional and translational fusions . 
Transcriptional and translational fusions of the ﬂiC gene to the lac operon and lacZ gene , respectively , were constructed in strains TH6232 , TH7293 , and TH7317 using the - Red system of Datsenko and Wanner ( 5 ) . 
A segment of DNA including the entire ﬂiC 5 UTR sequence from TH6232 , TH7293 , and TH7317 was transformed into strains TH6305 and TH6307 , which contain the MudJ and MudK lac transcriptional and translational fusion vectors in the ﬂiC coding region . 
The UTR sequence was ampliﬁed with primers carrying extensions ( between 36 and 40 nt ) homologous to the last portion of the targeted sequence ( forward primer ) and to a region downstream from it ( reverse primer ) to allow transfer of the sequence by recombination into the chromosome . 
Primers were engineered to insert ﬂiC promoter-down mutations to facilitate the measurement of - galac-tosidase levels . 
Primers used to introduce promoter-down mutations ( a A residue between the 10 and 35 promoter regions that is 23 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site or a C : T in the 10 region that is 13 bp upstream of the transcriptional start-site ) were as follows : 5 promoter 13-bp ﬂiC2 ( 5 - GAA GTG AAA AAT TTT CTA AAG TTC GAA ATT CAG GTG CTG ATA CAA GG-3 ) , 5 promoter TH7044 ( 5 - GGA AGT GAA AAA TTT TCT AAA GTT CGA ATT CAG G-3 ) , and 3 ﬂiC 39R ( 5 - CAG CGA CAG GCT GTT TG-3 ) . 
Both recipient strains TH6305 and TH6307 have a tetRA cassette insertion that removed a region of DNA , including the 10 sequence of ﬂiC promoter through 10 bases before the ATG start codon , and are in the ﬂiCON orientation . 
TH6305 has a ﬂiC-lac transcriptional fusion where transcription of the lac operon is dependent on the ﬂiC promoter , whereas lacZ is independently translated . 
TH6307 has the ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion , where both transcription and translation of lacZ are dependent on the ﬂiC promoter and the mRNA translation initiation region . 
Competent cells were concentrated 250-fold and transformed with 100 ng of PCR product . 
Recombinant colonies were selected by plating transformed cells on Tcs plates at 42 °C . 
Loss of the plasmid pKD46 was conﬁrmed by screening Tcs colonies for growth on L-Ap plates at 37 °C . 
Constructs were conﬁrmed by PCR using the primers 5 ﬂiC13 ( 5 - CTT TGT CAG GTC TGT C-3 ) , which contains homology to the upstream DNA immediately adjacent to ﬂiC ( 75 bp from ATG of ﬂiD reverse ) , and 3 ﬂiC 39R . 
Sequencing of the PCR products obtained was performed at the Biochemistry DNA Sequence Facility , University of Washington , Seattle . 
Construction of ﬂiC : : Mud-lac transcriptional and translational fusion to the ﬂiC gene in Mot revertant strains with promoter-down mutations . 
A tetRA cassette insertion was introduced in the ﬂiC gene between codons 12 and 13 in strains TH8856 , TH8862 , TH8868 , and TH8874 . 
The primers were as follows : FliC cod 12-13 tetR ( 5 - G ATC ATG GCA CAA GTC ATT AAT ACA AAC AGC CTG TCG CTG TTAAGACCCACTTTCACATT-3 ) and FliC cod 12-13 tetA ( 5 - C CAG AGC GGA CTG GGA TTT GTT CAG GTT ATT CTG GGT CAA CTAAGCACTTGTCTCCTG-3 ) . 
The tetRA cassette was replaced with a PCR product ( 253 bp in length ) from TH7312 , TH7314 , and TH7318 containing the respective Mot revertant ﬂiC coding sequence mutation . 
The ﬂiC sequence was ampliﬁed with the primers ﬂiC reverse CELI ( 5 - ATG GAG ATA CCG TCG-3 ) and ﬂiC-29 ( 5 - CAA GTT GTA ATT GAT AA-3 ) . 
Constructs were sequenced by using the primer ﬂiC13 ( 5 - CTT TGT CAG GTC TGT C-3 ) to conﬁrm the ﬂiC 5 UTR 38C : T , the ﬂiC promoter , and the ﬂiC coding sequence mutations . 
Construction of double mutants . 
Double mutants containing both the ﬂiC 5 UTR motile revertant deletion of SL2 [ ﬂiC 5 UTR ( 47 through 36 relative to AUG start codon ) ] from TH7317 and , respectively , the ﬂiC coding motile revertant mutations from strains TH7312 ( 41C : G ) , TH7314 ( 41 C : A ) , and TH7318 ( 37 T : C ) were constructed by using - Red ( 5 ) . 
A tetRA cassette was introduced into strains TH7312 , TH7314 , and TH7318 in the ﬂiC 5 UTR region , 40 bases upstream of the ﬂiC AUG start codon . 
The primers were as follows : FLICUTR ( 40BP ) tetR ( 5 - CTT TTC CTT ATC AAT TAC AAC TTG ATG TTA TTG GAC T TTAAGACCCACTTTCACATT-3 ) and FLICUTR ( 40BP ) tetA ( 5 - GCC GAT ACA AGG GTT ACG GTG AGA AAC CGT GGG CAAC CTAAGCACTTGTCTCCTG-3 ) . 
The tetRA cassette was replaced with a DNA fragment containing the TH7317 ﬂiC 5 UTR deletion . 
The PCR product of 113 bp was obtained by using the primers ﬂiC 39R ( 5 - CAG CGA CAG GCT GTT TG-3 ) and UTR ( 5 - TTC GAA ATT CAG GTG-3 ) . 
Strain constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing using the primer ﬂiC 39R . 
The strains with different ﬂgM alleles in strains with the ﬂiC-lac transcriptional reporter fusion ( ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ) were constructed as follows . 
Strain TH4107 enx ( pyrC691 : : Tn10 ﬂgM5222 : : MudCm ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ﬂjB vh2 ) was transduced to pyrC with P22 transducing phage lysates prepared on strains TH4572 ( ﬂgM5224 [ R5C ] ) , TH4576 ( ﬂgM5228 [ I82T ] ) , TH4577 ( ﬂgM5229 [ E89-Stop ] ) , TH5139 ( ﬂgM5628 : : FRT ) , TH8891 ( ﬂgM6318 [ G80-Stop ] ) , and LT2 selecting for growth on minimal glucose medium and screening for Tcs and Cms . 
PyrC transductants become Tcs due to the loss of the pyrC691 : : Tn10 allele , and transductants that also replace the pyrC-linked ﬂgM5222 : : MudCm allele with the ﬂgM allele of the donor strain are Cms . 
The resulting set of strains were then transduced to ampicillin resistance using a P22 transducing lysate prepared on strain TH6595 ( ﬂiC5469 : : MudB ) and screened for Kms . 
This resulted in replacement of the ﬂiC-lac transcriptional reporter with a ﬂiC-lac translational reporter , allowing assay of the effect of the ﬂgM alleles on ﬂiC-lac transcription and translation . 
The set of strains with the different ﬂgM alleles in strains with the ﬂiC5969 ( 38C : T allele ) and either the ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ or ﬂiC5469 : : MudK re porter fusions were constructed as follows . 
P22 transducing phage lysates prepared on strains TH6293 ( hin-5717 : : FRT ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ) and TH6295 ( hin-5717 : : FRT ﬂiC5469 : : MudK ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ) were used to separately transduce strains TH9408 , TH9409 , TH9410 , TH9411 , TH9412 , and TH9413 to Kmr and screened for a Tcs phenotype . 
Because the ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA Tcr allele is a replacement of the region including the ﬂiC 5 UTR through the 10 ﬂiC promoter region with the tetRA genes from transposon Tn10 , the Kmr , Tcs transductants would have inherited the ﬂiC : : MudJ or ﬂiC : : MudK reporter but retained the ﬂiC 5 UTR region of the recipient strains . 
The set of strains with the different ﬂgM alleles in the HBB mutant background ( ﬂgG-L ) used to measure FlgM anti- 28 activity using a class 3 transcriptional reporter fusion ( motA5461 : : MudJ ) were constructed as follows . 
A P22 transducing lysate grown on strain TH10067 ( pyrC : : FKF ﬂgM5222 : : MudCm ﬂgBC : : tetRA ﬂjBenx vh2 ) was used to transduce strain SJW1518 ( ﬂgG-L2157 ﬂjBenx vh2 ) to Kmr , which selects for the linked pyrC : : FKF allele and screened for Cmr and Tcs , which includes Kmr transductants that also brought in the linked ﬂgM5222 : : MudCm and retained the ﬂgG-L2157 allele because in order to be Cmr and Tcs , a recombination even had to occur between the ﬂgM and ﬂgB genes . 
This resulted in the creation of strain TH10218 . 
TH10067 was also used to transduce strains TH9408 , TH9409 , TH9410 , TH9411 , TH9412 , and TH9413 to Tcr , followed by a screen for Kms and Cms transductants to place the ﬂgBC : : tetRA adjacent to the six ﬂgM alleles . 
P22 transducing lysates were grown on these six strains and used to transduce TH10218 to pyrC , followed by a screen for Tcs and Cms , which resulted in the placement of the ﬂgG-L2157 allele adjacent to the six ﬂgM alleles . 
These six strains were then transduced to Kmr with P22 lysate grown on strain TH3933 ( motA5461 : : MudJ ) to generate strains TH10231 through TH10236 . 
Isolation of the ﬂiC coding sequence mutations from the ﬂiC 5 UTR ( 38C : T ) mutant . 
Constructs were obtained by using - Red ( 5 ) . 
As a recipient strain we used TH8670 that has a Tn10dTc insertion in the ﬂiC gene , after coding base 71 . 
Synthesis of the double-stranded DNA to be used for Tn10dTc replacement was performed by an in vitro polymerization reaction ( ﬁll-in ) using two primers of different lengths . 
Long primers ( 91 bases ) carried the ﬂiC coding sequence second-site suppressor of the motility defect in the ﬂiC 5 UTR 38C : T mutant . 
The primers were as follows : Mot # 4 ﬂiCutr ( 5 - G TCG CTG TTG AGC CAG AAT AAC CTG AAC AAA TCC CAG TCC GCT CTG GGC ACC GCT ATC GAG CGT CTG TCT TCC GGT CTG CGT ATC AAC AGC-3 ) carrying the TH7312 mutation ( 41 C : G ) , Mot # 6 ﬂiCutr ( 5 - G TCG CTG TTG AAC CAG AAT AAC CTG AAC AAA TCC CAG TCC GCT CTG GGC ACC GCT ATC GAG CGT CTG TCT TCC GGT CTG CGT ATC AAC AGC-3 ) carrying the TH7314 mutation ( 41 C : A ) , Mot # 10 ﬂiCutr ( 5 - G TCG CTG CTG ACC CAG AAT AAC CTG AAC AAA TCC CAG TCC GCT CTG GGC ACC GCT ATC GAG CGT CTG TCT TCC GGT CTG CGT ATC AAC AGC-3 ) carrying the TH7318 ( 37 T : C ) mutation , and Mot 3 Fillin ( 5 - GTT GAT ACG CAG ACC-3 ) complementary to the 3 ends of the latter primers and used to provide a free 3 - hydroxyl group for initiation of synthesis . 
Construction of ﬂgM alleles into strain TH7293 . 
A ﬂgM : : tetRA insertiondeletion was introduced in strain TH7293 by using - Red ( 5 ) . 
The primers used were as follows : ﬂgM TAA tetA ( 5 - C ATC TGG TCA AGT ATT TCT GAC AAA CGA GTC ATA CGC TTA CTAAGCACTTGTCTCCTG-3 ) and ﬂgM AUG tetR ( 5 - A GCT GGC CGC TAC AAC GTA ACC CTC GAT GAG GAT AAA TAA-3 ) . 
PCR veriﬁcation was performed to conﬁrm the correct structure with the primers T1Test ( 5 - AGG AGA GAT TTC ACC GC-3 ) , which is 750 bases upstream of the tetA stop codon reading out of tetA , and ﬂgM3 ( 5 - CTG GTC AAG TAT TTC-3 ) . 
The tetRA cassette was then replaced with the ﬂgM gene from the TH7293 motile revertant strain TH8891 ( ﬂgM G80Stop ) . 
The ﬂgM gene was ampliﬁed with the primers ﬂgM3 ( 5 - CTG GTC AAG TAT TTC-3 ) and FLGMAUG-40 ( 5 - TGG CCG CTA CAA CGT AA-3 ) . 
Flagellum staining . 
Cells were grown in LB to an optical density at 600 nm of ca. 0.6 to 0.8 . 
A 0.5-ml volume of bacterial culture was gently mixed with 0.1 ml of fresh ﬁxative solution ( 1 ml of 16 % paraformaldehyde , 1.5 l of glutaraldehyde ) and 20 l of 1 M NaPO4 buffer ( pH 7.4 ) . 
A 10 - l volume of sample was added into each well of a poly-L-lysine ( Sigma ) multitest slide by using a widebore Eppendorf tip . 
Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature . 
Fixed bacteria were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ; pH 7.4 ) and allowed to dry completely . 
A 10 - l volume of blocking solution ( 2 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] in PBS ) was added to each well , and the slides were incubated for 10 min at room temperature ( 9 , 25 ) . 
Cells were then treated with 10 l of the anti-FliC antibody ( Difco Salmonella H antiserum ) puriﬁed by serum afﬁnity chromatography as described previously ( 10 ) at a 1:200 dilution in BSA-PBS overnight at 4 °C . 
Slides were placed on wetted 3MM paper in a petri dish and wrapped with Paraﬁlm to prevent evaporation . 
Samples were washed 10 times with PBS and treated with 10 l of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody ( 1:200 dilution in BSA-PBS ) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark . 
Samples were washed eight times with PBS and equilibrated with 1 drop of SlowFade Light Antifade Equilibration Buffer ( Molecular Probes ) . 
Cell membranes and DNA were stained with 1 l of FM4-64 ( 1 mg/ml ; Molecular Probes ) ( 24 ) and 2 l of DAPI ( 4 ,6 - diamidino-2-phenylin-dole ; 2 ng/ml ; Molecular Probes ) . 
Slides were mounted in SlowFade glycerol ( Molecular Probes ) . 
Samples were observed with a Zeiss Axioscope 2 MOT microscope equipped with a 100 objective lens and photographed with an Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera . 
Cells were illuminated with a 100 Mercury arc with the following cubes set ( Chroma Technology ) : 41028 yellow green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) BP for FITC , 31058 FM4-64 for the FM4-64 probe , and 31041 blue GFP II for DAPI . 
Individual ﬂuorescent channels and images were merged by using Open Lab modular software ( Scientiﬁc Imagin ) to create the ﬁnal picture . 
RNA isolation . 
Strains were grown in LB broth at 37 °C to logarithmic phase ( optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 ) . 
Transcription was inhibited by rifampin ( Sigma ) treatment at a concentration of 500 g/ml . 
A 1.5-ml volume of culture was added to a guanidine ( GuSCN ) - phenol solution ( 7.5 M guanidine thiocya-nate , 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM sodium acetate [ pH 4.0 ] ) at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , and 4 min after the addition of rifampin . 
Total RNA was prepared as described previously ( 8 ) . 
RNA samples were analyzed by aga-rose gel electrophoresis to ensure RNA quality . 
Probe construction . 
A [ 32P ] UTP radiolabeled RNA probe used to detect the ﬂiC transcript was synthesized by using an in vitro transcription reaction ( Ambion MAXIscript ) . 
Template DNA for the transcription reaction was ampliﬁed using the following primers : T7 ﬂiC 3 ( 5 - TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GA CAC ATT CAG CGT ATC CAG AC-3 ) and 5 Vitrotran ﬂiC ( 5 - TGC GCA GAC CAC TGA AG-3 ) . 
T7 ﬂiC 3 has the T7 promoter sequence ( 19 bp ) at the 5 end . 
Ampliﬁcation of the target DNA yielded a PCR product that contained the T7 promoter upstream of the sequence of interest . 
The probe was complementary to the sequence of the ﬂiC transcript located between 217 to 504 bases downstream of the ﬂiC ATG start codon . 
The PCR product was examined on agarose gel to verify that the product was unique and of the expected size . 
A tota of 0.1 g of double-stranded DNA was used as a template in the in vitro transcription reaction . 
RESULTS
Isolation and characterization of motile revertants of the ﬂiC 5 UTR 38C : T allele . 
In an accompanying study , the 5 end of the ﬂiC gene was mutagenized , and motility-defective mutants were isolated and characterized for defects in transcription , translation , and ﬁlament assembly ( 1 ) . 
A stem-loop structure , SL2 , within the ﬂiC 5 UTR was identiﬁed that appeared to be critical for ﬂiC translation because mutants defective in stem formation showed reduced ﬂiC mRNA translation and motility . 
For example , the single mutants 45G : C and 38C : G in SL2 reduced translation and possessed a mo-tility defect , while the 45G : C 38C : G double mutant had wild-type levels of ﬂiC mRNA translation and was motile . 
We sought to characterize the role of SL2 in ﬂiC mRNA translation through the isolation and characterization of motile revertants of one of the SL2 translation-speciﬁc mutants ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Strain TH7293 carries a ﬂiC-5 UTR single base mutation in SL2 ( 38C : U ) that is defective in ﬂiC mRNA translation , resulting in a motility-defective phenotype ( Mot ) . 
Mot revertants of the 38C : T mutant were isolated and characterized . 
The Mot revertants were ﬁrst screened for linkage to the ﬂiC gene , and ca. 99 % of the Mot revertants were linked to the ﬂiC gene . 
Linkage was determined by growing a P22 transducing lysate on the Mot revertants strains , and the lysate was used to transduce strain TH7952 [ hin-5717 : : FRT ON ( ﬂiC ) ﬂiC5532 : : tetRA ] to Tcs . 
Strain TH7952 has a segment of DNA containing the 10 of the ﬂiC promoter through base 10 from the ﬂiC ATG start codon deleted and replaced s by a tetRA cassette ( 1 ) . 
Transduction to Tc will replace the s tetRA cassette with the ﬂiC 5 end from the donor strain . 
Tc transductants were tested directly for motility onto motility plates for linkage of the Mot revertants in the donor strain to the ﬂiC region . 
We performed , as a control , the same genetic cross using as donor a P22 lysate grown on the parent strain TH7293 . 
Selection was done for Tcs colonies . 
As expected , all transductant colonies ( 100 of 100 ) from the control cross were Mot . 
DNA sequence analysis of ﬂiC-linked motile revertants of the ﬂiC 38C : T 5 UTR allele . 
Initially , 14 independent motil 
( Mot ) revertants of strain TH7293 were isolated , and all were linked to ﬂiC . 
DNA sequence analysis resulted in two catego-ries of mutations ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Ten Mot revertants had mutations in the 5 UTR , including single base changes at positions 15 , 39 , 41 , and 46 ( relative to the ATG start codon ) ; a single base deletion at 45 ; a duplication of bases 7 through 1 ; a deletion of the entire SL2 and a double mutant with a single base insertion of A at the original 40 position ; and a large duplication from 37 through 22 . 
In addition to the 5 UTR mutants , four mutants were obtained with single base changes in the ﬂiC-coding region at amino acids 13 and 14 . 
One of these , obtained twice , was a silent mutation at amino acid 13 ( L13L ) , and the other two were at amino acid 14 ( T14S and T14N ) . 
We found the revertant resulting from a complete deletion of SL2 to be remarkable . 
Prior to the isolation of this mutant , we thought the fact that the 38C : T ﬂiC 5 UTR mutant was defective in ﬂiC mRNA translation meant that this region was required for translation . 
The fact that the entire SL2 could be deleted to restore translation is strong evidence that SL2 is a translational inhibitory domain of the 5 UTR , and the 38C : T allele resulted in an increase in the translational inhibitory activity of the domain . 
A rare , unlinked motile revertant of the ﬂiC 38C : T 5 UTR allele is in ﬂgM . 
In an independent set of experiments , 160 independent Mot revertants of strain TH7293 were isolated and checked for linkage to ﬂiC . 
All but one was linked . 
The unlinked Mot revertant was mapped through the isolation of a linked Tn10dTc transposon . 
One insertion that was 67 % linked to Mot by P22-mediated transduction was determined by DNA sequence analysis to be in the mviM gene that encodes for a putative Salmonella virulence factor . 
The mviM gene is closely linked to the ﬂagellar ﬂg genes . 
Three-factor mapping analysis was performed using the mviM : : Tn10dTc and a pyrC : : Cm allele to localize the ﬂiC-unlinked Mot mutation to a small enough region of the chromosome that could be analyzed by DNA sequence analysis . 
The three-factor cross analysis placed the Mot allele clockwise of both mviM and pyrC on the standard Salmonella linkage map in the vicinity of the ﬂgAMN genes . 
Further DNA sequence analysis revealed the Mot allele to be a single-base-change mutation in the ﬂgM gene ( 238 G : T ) 53bases upstream the ﬂgM gene stop codon that resulted in a TGA stop codon at the G80 amino acid codon position of ﬂgM [ GGA ( Gly ) 80 : TGA ( Stop ) ] . 
Effect of ﬂiC-linked 38C : T motile revertants on ﬂiC expression . 
To investigate the contribution of the 38C : T mutation on ﬂiC expression , ﬂiC-lac transcriptional and translational fusions in ﬂiC were introduced into strains that had either a wild-type ﬂiC 5 UTR , the , 38C : T allele ( ﬂiC5969 ) , or the deletion the ﬂiC 5 UTR SL2 region ( SL2 ) . 
Initial assays showed ﬂiC expression of the translational reporter fusion to be elevated by the SL2 deletion ( Table 2 , compare TH6235 [ row 1 ] to TH8905 [ row 3 ] ) , although the standard deviation was too high in these assays to be conclusive . 
In order to get a more accurate measure on the effect of SL2 on ﬂiC translation , we introduced mutations in the ﬂiC promoter region that had been isolated in our lab to downregulate ﬂiC gene transcription ( 1 ) . 
The purpose of using promoter-down mutations was twofold . 
First , the ﬂiC gene has a strong promoter , and - galactosidase activities are easier to measure when ﬂiC-lac a The numbers are - galactosidase activity units in nmol/min/optical density at 650 nm ml . 
The levels of ﬂiC transcription and translation were assayed using either a ﬂiC : : MudJ ( lac transcriptional ) or ﬂiC : : MudK ( lac translational ) reporter fusions ( 3 ) . 
All strains are locked in the ﬂiCON orientation ( hin-5717 : : FRT ) . 
These assays were performed in the presence or absence of a ﬂiC promoter down mutation ( A between the 10 and 35 promoter regions [ 23 relative to the transcription start site ] ) . 
This was done to show that regulation was independent of ﬂiC promoter strength and allows future Lac revertant selections to be done with the promoter-down mutant backgrounds . 
The following strains were used ( listed in order of MudJ then MudK ) : wild type , wild-type promoter-down , TH8860 and TH8872 ; ﬂiC5969 ( 38C : T ) promoterdown , TH8862 and TH8874 ; SL2 motile revertant promoter-down , TH8864 and TH8876 . 
TH6232 was used as the background ( no-Mud ) control . 
fusions are expressed at lower levels . 
Second , the 38C : T mutant is Lac on selective media with the normal ﬂiC promoter , but Lac with the promoter-down mutation , which facilitates the isolation of revertants using Lac selections . 
The promoter-down mutation was a single base deletion in the spacer region between the 10 and 35 promoter sequences ( 23 A relative to 1 of the translation ) . 
We obtained statistically signiﬁcant results with the promoter-down allele . 
The effect of the SL2 mutation was to increase ﬂiC-lacZ translation ca. 30 % over the wild type ( Table 2 , compare strains TH8872 [ row 4 ] and TH8876 [ row 6 ] ) . 
Transcriptional assays of strains with either a wild-type ﬂiC 5 UTR region , the 38C : T , or the SL2 allele all showed similar - galactosidase levels , with or without the ﬂiC promoterdown allele , indicating that the 38C : T and SL2 mutations in the ﬂiC 5 UTR had no apparent effect on ﬂiC transcription or mRNA stability ( Table 2 ) . 
These results were conﬁrmed by RNase protection assays ( data not shown ) . 
In contrast a ﬁve - to sevenfold decrease in - galactosidase activity was observed with the ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion with the 38C : T 5 UTR mutation ( Table 2 , compare TH6235 [ row 1 ] and TH 8904 [ row 2 ] and compare TH8872 [ row 4 ] with TH8874 [ row 5 ] ) . 
As mentioned above , deletion of SL2 restored ﬂiC translation to a level greater than that observed with the wild-type ﬂiC 5 UTR . 
To determine whether the SL2 deletion results in increased ﬂiC mRNA translation compared to ﬂiC mRNA with the wild-type 5 - UTR , FliC protein levels were measured in wildtype ( TH6232 ) , 38C : T ( TH7293 ) , and SL2 ( TH7317 ) strains . 
A ﬁvefold decrease in FliC protein levels due to the 38C : T mutation and a 50 % increase in FliC protein levels due to the SL2 mutation over the wild-type levels were observed by Western blot analysis ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The results presented above indicate that SL2 is a negativ regulator of ﬂiC mRNA translation and suggest that the 38C : T substitution enhanced this inhibitory role . 
Four Mot revertants of the 38C : T allele had the second site mutation in the ﬂiC coding sequence : TH7312 ( 41C : G ) , TH7314 ( 41C : A ) , TH7318 , and TH7321 ( 37T : C ) . 
The fact that one of these Mot revertant mutations ( in both TH7318 and TH7321 ) resulted in a change of a nonrare leucine codon to another nonrare leucine codon suggested that the effect of these mutations was due to the changes in mRNA sequence independent of the amino acid codon change . 
The FliC protein was assayed for the ﬂiC-coding Mot revertants in the 38C : T background ( TH7312 , TH7314 , and TH7318 ) ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The 41C : A allele of strain TH7314 restored FliC levels to those seen in the wild-type strain TH6232 . 
The other two coding revertant alleles , 37T : C ( TH7318 ) and 41C : G ( TH7312 ) , had 50 % higher FliC levels comparable to the SL2 deletion revertant strain ( TH7317 ) . 
The ﬂiC-coding Mot revertant alleles were separated from the original 38C : T mutation . 
When separated from the 38C : T mutation , the FliC levels were at best 30 % higher for 37 T : C ( TH8882 ) and 41 C : A 
( TH8879 ) and the same for the 41 C : G allele ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Consistent with the FliC levels observed , the ﬂiC-coding Mot revertant alleles exhibited a wild-type motility phenotype ( data not shown ) . 
Potential interaction of the ﬂiC 5 UTR SL2 region with ﬂiC coding sequences . 
The isolation of 38C : T motile suppressors in the ﬂiC coding region at positions 37 and 41 suggested that these regions might interact . 
When these sequences were aligned , we found a remarkably strong potential stem structure that could form by base pairing between the SL2 region of the 5 UTR and a region of ﬂiC coding sequence from positions 32 through 43 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
According to this model , a stretch of 11 bases in the SL2 region of the ﬂiC 5 UTR can base pair with a stretch of 12 bases in the ﬂiC coding sequence , leaving a single A residue unpaired . 
We decided to insert a base in the ﬂiC 5 UTR between the 44C and 45G residues that could have the potential of base pairing with the unpaired A residue in the ﬂiC coding sequence . 
An insertion of A , C , or G resulted in a motility phenotype similar to that of the wild type , whereas the insertion of a T residue resulted in a nonmotile phenotype ( results not shown ) . 
This suggests that strengthening of the interaction of SL2 with the ﬂiC coding region has an inhibitory effect on ﬂiC translation . 
The insertion of A , C , or G was not expected to enhance the interaction between the SL2 region , and the resulting motile phenotypes are in agreement with this result . 
Effect of ﬂgM alleles on suppression of the 38C : T translation defect . 
Strain TH8891 [ hin-5717 : : FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC596 
( 38C : T ) ﬂgM6318 ( G80Stop ) ] harbors the ﬂiC-unlinked Mot revertant of 38C : T that resulted in stop codon mutation at amino acid 80 of FlgM . 
To verify that this single base change at codon 80 was responsible for the Mot revertants phenotype , the ﬂgM region from TH8891 was ampliﬁed by PCR , and the resulting DNA fragment was used to replace the ﬂgM : : tetRA allele introduced into the parent strain TH7293 [ hin-5717 : : FRT ( ﬂiCON ) ﬂiC5969 ( 38C : T ) ] using selection for Tcs in the presence of the - Red functions . 
The new strain , TH9213 , acquired the Mot revertant phenotype of the donor strain , indicating that the ﬂgM6318 ( G80Stop ) allele could suppress the motility defect caused by decreased ﬂiC mRNA translation of the 38C : T mutation . 
This was quite unexpected . 
FlgM inhibits ﬂiC transcription as an anti- 28 factor , but the 38C : T mutation does not affect ﬂiC transcription ( Table 2 ) . 
However , increased ﬂiC transcription could compensate for reduced ﬂiC mRNA translation if an overall increase in ﬂiC transcript led to more FliC gene product . 
However , why was the ﬂgM6318 ( G80Stop ) suppressor of the 38C : T motility-defective mutation such a rare occurrence ( 1 % of motile revertants ) ? 
To determine whether the loss of FlgM resulted in suppression of the 38C : T-dependent motility-defective phenotype , a set of ﬂgM alleles isolated as having reduced or no anti- 28 activity was transduced into the TH7293 ﬂgM : : tetRA strain selecting for Tcs . 
The set included ﬂgM and a complete nonpolar deletion ( ﬂgM5628 : : FRT ) of ﬂgM , two point mutants -- ﬂgM5524 ( R5C ) and ﬂgM5528 ( I82T ) -- that are defective in interacting with 28 , and ﬂgM5529 , which has a stop codon mutation at amino acid 89 of ﬂgM . 
A gradient of motility suppression was observed ( Fig. 4 ) . 
A slight increase in motility was observed with the single amino acid substitution mutants , a little more with 89-Stop mutant , and even more with the complete ﬂgM deletion . 
However , the ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) allele clearly suppressed the motility defect over all other ﬂgM alleles . 
This suggests that truncated FlgM , missing its last 18 amino acids but not missing its last 9 amino acids , has an active role in suppressing the translation defect of the ﬂiC 38C : T mutation independent of its anti- 28 activity . 
Effect of ﬂgM alleles on 28-dependent transcription . 
The ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) suppressor was tested for its effect on ﬂiC transcription and translation compared to the other ﬂgM alleles by using lac transcriptional and translational reporter constructs ( Table 3 ) ( 3 ) . 
Both the ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) suppressor allele and the ﬂgM allele with the entire ﬂgM coding region deleted ( ﬂgM5628 : : FRT ) exhibited a comparable in

The other ﬂgM alleles -- ﬂgM5524 ( R5C ) , ﬂgM5528 ( I82T ) , and ﬂgM5529 ( E89-Stop ) -- had only a small effect on ﬂiC-lac expression ( compare row 1 [ ﬂgM ] to rows 2 , 3 , and 4 in Table 3 ) . 
The ﬂiC-lac transcriptional and translational assays were repeated in the presence of the ﬂiC 38C : T mutation ( ﬂiC5969 ) . 
The ﬂiC5969 showed reduced ﬂiC-lac transcription of ca. 25 % and reduced ﬂiC-lac transcription and translation of ca. 95 % ( Table 3 , compare row 1 with row 7 ) . 
Again , both the ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) and the ﬂgM5628 alleles exhibited comparable increases in - galactosidase activity in the lac transcriptional and translational fusion constructs compared to the ﬂgM allele ( Table 3 , compare row 7 with rows 11 and 12 ) , whereas the other ﬂgM alleles had smaller effects ( Table 3 , compare row 7 with rows 8 , 9 , and 10 ) . 
These results demonstrate that the ﬂgM motile revertant of the ﬂiC 38C : T 5 UTR mutant allele , ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) , did not exhibit signiﬁcant differences in its effect on ﬂiC transcription and translation in the presence or absence of the 38C : T 5 UTR mutant allele compared to the complete deletion allele of ﬂgM ( ﬂgM5628 ) . 
Finally , we tested the effect of the ﬂgM alleles on the expression of a lac transcriptional reporter to another 28-de-pendent promoter , the motA promoter , in a strain defective in HBB formation ( ﬂgG-L ) . 
The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether FlgM ( G80-Stop ) was able to bind a The numbers are - galactosidase activity units in nmol/min/optical density at 28 650 nm ml .

28 and show anti- 28 activity . 
The ﬂgG-L mutation prevents FlgM secretion from the cell and 28-dependent transcription is completely inhibited ( 10 ) . 
In this assay , the ﬂgM5524 ( R5C ) , ﬂgM5528 ( I82T ) , and ﬂgM5529 ( E89-Stop ) alleles show signiﬁcant anti- 28 activity ( Table 4 , compare ﬂgM [ row 1 ] with rows 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , whereas the ﬂgM5529 ( E89-Stop ) allele showed only a small decrease in motA-lac expression compared to the ﬂgM5628 allele [ Table 4 , compare ﬂgM ( row 1 ) with ﬂgM5628 ( row 5 ) and with ﬂgM5529 ( E89-Stop ) ( row 6 ) ] . 
These results demonstrate that the ﬂgM6318 ( G80-Stop ) allele did not exhibit signiﬁcant differences in its effect on anti- 28 activity compared to the complete deletion allele of ﬂgM ( ﬂgM5628 ) . 
Effect of the ﬂiC 38C : T allele and motile revertant alleles on ﬂagellum production . 
The effect of the ﬂiC 38C : T 5 UTR allele on ﬂagellum production was examined by microscopy . 
Immunomicroscopy was performed with strains TH6232 ( ﬂiC ) , TH7293 ( 38C : T ) , and TH7317 ( SL2 ) . 
The cells were treated with the live membrane stain FM4-64 ( red ) and DAPI ( blue DNA stain ) . 
Flagellar ﬁlaments ( FliC ) were colored green by using a polyclonal anti-FliC antibody followed by the addition of anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody as described in Materials and Methods ( Fig. 5 ) . 
TH6232 ( ﬂiC ) cells showed an average of ﬁve to six ﬂagella per surface area , while TH7293 ( ﬂiC-5 UTR 38C : T ) had an average of one or two short ﬂagella per cell . 
TH7317 ( SL2 ) exhibited at least as many ﬂagella as the TH6232 ( ﬂiC ) control . 
The results are consistent with a reduction of ﬂiC mRNA translation by the ﬂiC 38C : T 5 UTR allele and normal or slightly elevated ( 50 % ) ﬂiC mRNA translation with the ﬂiC SL2 5 UTR de-letion mutant . 
DISCUSSION
We discovered a region of the ﬂiC 5 UTR that is involved in the inhibition of ﬂiC translation . 
A stem-loop region within the 5 UTR , called SL2 , was identiﬁed as having a number of base substitutions that were defective in expression of a ﬂiC-lacZ translational fusion reporter but did not affect the expression of a ﬂiC-lac transcriptional fusion reporter ( 1 ) . 
The mutant with decreased translation all destabilized the stem of SL2 . 
One pair of mutations that were in the different bases within a presumed SL2 base pair , 38C : G and 45G : C , individually resulted in defective ﬂiC mRNA translation , but the combination of the two resulted in wild-type translation levels . 
In the present study , motile revertants were analyzed for one trans-lation-defective mutant of the SL2 stem , TH7293 , that harbors the 38C : T mutation . 
The analysis of motile revertants led to several surprising discoveries . 
One surprising result from the DNA sequence analysis of motile revertants was that one motile revertant had SL2 completely and precisely deleted . 
This demonstrated that SL2 was not required for normal ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
In fact , there was a slight increase in ﬂiC mRNA translation in the SL2 deletion mutant . 
We can only conclude that SL2 does not function to facilitate ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
The fact that translation-defective mutants arise from single base substitutions that disrupt the stem of SL2 suggests that SL2 has a role in the inhibition of ﬂiC mRNA translation under some as-yet-unidentiﬁed condition . 
Mutations that disrupt the stem lead to the loss of controlled inhibition by SL2 so that SL2 inhibitory activity is constitutive . 
We suspect that ﬂiC transcription is localized to the base of the ﬂagellum to couple ﬂiC mRNA translation to assembly . 
It is possible that SL2 has a role in preventing unwanted ﬂiC mRNA translation in the cytoplasm where translation is not coupled to secretion and assembly . 
However , since cells deleted for the SL2 are perfectly motile , it can not be essential for ﬂiC translation and assembly . 
The SL2 segment probably contributes to the efﬁciency of the assembly process . 
A second unexpected ﬁnding was that a number of suppressors of the translation-defective 38C : T allele were in the ﬂiC coding region . 
These suppressors were at positions 37 and 41 relative to the beginning of the ATG start codon . 
The ﬁnding that one suppressor did not change the amino acid codon is consistent with a translation-speciﬁc effect . 
This intriguing set of mutants is reminiscent of the signal recognition particle pathway in gram-negative bacteria involved in the cotranslation assembly of inner membrane proteins . 
The N-ter-minal 50 amino acids of the FliC protein ( 1-MAQVINTNSL SLLTQNNLNK SQSALGTAIE RLSSGLRINS AKDDAAG QAI-50 ) include the secretion signal and are not visible in the ﬁnal crystal structure ( 29 ) but could be visualized by using electron cyromicroscopy and image analysis ( 30 ) . 
The N terminus of a peptide can affect the location of translation in the cell . 
The signal recognition particle pathway recognizes the nascent N-terminal peptide of proteins destined for the cytoplasmic membrane or for the Sec type II secretion pathway and facilitates the localized translation of these proteins ( 7 ) . 
It may be that there are regions in the ﬂiC mRNA sequence that cause ribosome stalling to prevent ﬂiC mRNA translation when it is not coupled to secretion . 
Two such regions would be SL2 and the sequence around the amino acid 13,14 coding region . 
When these sequences are aligned , there is a remarkably strong stem structure that forms ( Fig. 3 ) . 
All of the motile revertants of the 38C : U translation defect that were due to sequence changes in either SL2 or the 37/41 coding region disrupt this stem structure . 
Strengthening the interaction between the SL2 region of the ﬂiC 5 UTR and the ﬂiC coding region by insertion of a T residue at position 45 relative t the ATG start codon resulted in a nonmotile phenotype , whereas insertion of A , G , or C , which are not predicted to strengthen this interaction , had no effect on motility . 
This supports the model that interaction between these regions plays an important role in the regulation of ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
It is not clear how the duplication revertants affect this stem-loop structure since additional sequence could easily affect the secondary and tertiary conformations of the ﬂiC 5 mRNA structure . 
A third unexpected result was the isolation of the 15G : A substitution resulting in suppression of the motility defect of the strain with a 38C : T translation defective mutation . 
This is because that exact same mutation , the 15G : A transition in the ﬂiC 5 UTR sequence , was among the single base substitution mutations in the original ﬂiC translation-defective mutants ( 1 ) . 
Somehow the 15 position can inﬂuence the SL2 region in both a positive and a negative manner , depending on what base is located at the 38 position ( relative to the AUG start codon ) of the ﬂiC 5 UTR . 
The isolation and characterization of motile revertants of the 15G : A in a strain with the `` C '' base at the 38 position ( the wild-type base at this position ) should result in the isolation of 38C : T mutants along with other suppressors that might lead to a better understanding of how the 15 position functions in the regulation of ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
The ﬁnal unexpected result was the isolation of a motile suppressor in the ﬂgM gene . 
This rare suppressor ( 1 % of motile suppressors of TH7293 ) was unusual because the degree of suppression was dependent on the loss of the last 18 amino acids of FlgM and not on an FlgM-null phenotype . 
Mutants isolated as defective in anti- 28 activity did not suppress the ﬂiC mRNA translation defect caused by the 38C : T mutation . 
This result leads us to conclude that the very C terminus of FlgM is involved in regulation of ﬂiC mRNA translation . 
It ﬁts with the position of single amino acid substitution mutations in FlgM that are defective in anti- 28 activity . 
These all reside in the region from amino acid 57 through amino acid 82 . 
We have isolated a stop codon mutant at amino acid codon 89 of ﬂgM with reduced anti- 28 activity , but it retains the translation defect caused by the 38C : T mutation in the ﬂiC 5 UTR . 
The fact that no single amino acid substitutions in FlgM relieved the ﬂiC mRNA translation inhibitory activity suggests that there are multiple amino acids in the C terminus of FlgM that contribute to this activity . 
A good future experiment would be a targeted mutagenesis of the C-terminal 18-amino-acid coding region of ﬂgM , followed by a screen for increased or decreased translation of ﬂiC mRNA .
