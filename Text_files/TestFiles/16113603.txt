Summary : Transformed attenuated Salmonella typhimurium ( ST ) have been suggested as an efﬁcient means of tumor vaccination . 
However , ST themselves might be immunosuppressive , and the question has arisen as to whether this impedes vaccination efﬁcacy even if ST are transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector such that `` tumor antigen '' will be transcribed by the host . 
The question was evaluated using a mutant SL7207 , where the yej operon , which interferes with MHC I-mediated presentation , had been inactivated ( SL7207DyejE ) . 
Mice were vaccinated with SL7207 or SL7207DyejE transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector carrying the lacZ or the gp100 gene and later received lacZ-transfected RENCA or YC8 or gp100-expressing B16F1 tumor cells . 
In vaccinated mice , tumor growth started with a delay and some animals remained tumor-free ; however , the tumor growth rate remained unaltered . 
No signiﬁcant difference was seen between SL7207DyejE versus SL7207 vaccinated mice . 
The latter ﬁnding contrasted with ex vivo analyses where vaccination with SL7207DyejE , compared with SL7207 , induced a signiﬁcantly stronger response , including nonadaptive defense mechanisms . 
The failure to detect a superior vaccination efﬁcacy of 
( J Immunother 2005 ; 28:467 -- 479 ) 
SL7207DyejE in vivo could be attributed to a stronger effect of the yej operon on MHC-mediated antigen presentation when driven by a prokaryotic promoter . 
Also , additional Salmonella genes apparently interfere with maintenance of a sustained immune response . 
Thus , the immunosuppressive yej operon affects innate and adaptive immunity . 
However , when ST are carriers for eukaryotic-expressed tumor antigens , yej does not severely hamper induction of an immune response .

Key Words : tumor vaccination , Salmonella typhimurium , immunosuppression he molecular identiﬁcation of tumor antigens has led to T a revival of active immunization as a mode of cancer therapy .1 So far a wide range of different vaccination schedules have been explored , including DNA , RNA , proteins , and peptides , as well as carrier-mediated and carrier-free systems .2 -- 4 Every system has advantages but also disadvantages . 
DNA , RNA , and protein vaccination have the advantages of allowing the presentation of multiple epitopes and a systeminherent presentation by the individual patient 's matching MHC . 
However , whole proteins are frequently difﬁcult to create in large quantities . 
Carrier-free systems of DNA and RNA application may be burdened by insufﬁcient transcription and translation .5 Thus , the transfer of ex vivo loaded or transfected/infected dendritic cells as the most potent antigenpresenting cells is generally agreed to be one of the methods of choice .6 However , the ex vivo generation of dendritic cells is very time-consuming and cost-intensive and also depends at least in part on the health of the patient , and there is an urgent need for easier-to-handle vaccines . 
Vaccination with transformed attenuated Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes could well represent such an alternative .7 -- 10 Salmonella typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen whose capacity to cause systemic disease depends upon its ability to survive and replicate within macrophages .11 -- 14 The bacteria can cross the epithelial barrier of the gut and will be taken up by macrophages ( Mf ) and other mucosa-associated phagocytes .12 -- 15 In fact , the generation of several attenuated forms of these bacteria , which still pass the epithelial barrier and are taken up by Mf but survive for only a limited number of cell cycles , has opened new and promising pathways of vaccination .7,16 -- 19 This accounts for vaccination against the pathogen 7,16,17 itself as well as for using the attenuated bacteria as 7,16 -- 21 a DNA vehicle . 
Depending on whether the DNA is inserted into a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic expression vector , the DNA will be transcribed by the Salmonella or by the host 's Mf after digestion of the attenuated bacteria .8,16,20,22 -- 24 Vaccination of tumor-bearing mice with attenuated SL , which had been transformed with a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic expression vector , has been explored in several animal models and has provided promising results .25 -- 31 Mf are equipped with efﬁcient natural killing mechanisms .32 Thus , intraphagosomal bacteria can be expected to evolve mechanisms withstanding or suppressing the killing activities of Mf .7,33,34 While immunosuppressive mechanisms exploited by viruses are well known ,35 much less is known about immune escape mechanisms and immunosuppressive features of intracellular bacteria . 
Thus , some Salmonella typhimurium ( ST ) strains have evolved mechanisms to limit bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of reactive nitrogen intermediates and reactive oxygen species .36 The Salmonella protein SpiC is exported into the host cell cytosol and interferes with intracellular trafﬁcking and lysosomal fusion with the Salmonella-containing vacuoles .37,38 Considering bacterial genes that interfere with Mf-mediated antigen presentation required for the induction of a T-cell-mediated immune response , it has been shown that MHC class II presentation is enhanced in Mf infected with PhoP-mutant Salmonella .39 Also , Chlamydia secretes a factor that suppresses MHC class I and class II antigen expression .40 Salmonella can induce alternative splicing of HLA-B27 pre-mRNA such that due to misfolding of the molecule peptide presentation is impaired .41 In addition , we recently performed a systemic search for ST genes that interfere with the MHC class I presentation pathway .42 Besides the already known gene PhoP , the yej operon in ST has been shown to interfere with peptide presentation on MHC class I molecules . 
A mutant in yejE was used as vaccine vector in mice using ovalbumin 257-265 as model antigen . 
Though invasiveness was comparable to nonmutated ST , the mutant did inﬂuence presentation of ovalbumin , but only when the bacteria had been transformed with the ovalbumin gene . 
The data were interpreted in the sense that the yejE gene acts spe-ciﬁcally in the phagosome .42 We have described before that vaccination with attenuated ST transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector carrying full-length cDNA of an ( artiﬁcial ) tumor-associated antigen like the lacZ gene or the murine gp100 cDNA sufﬁces for induction of a T-cell response , particularly of CD8 + CTL .28,43 Thus it became of interest whether a mutant Salmonella strain enhancing MHC class I-mediated presentation would have a positive impact on antigen presentation even if Salmonella are transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector , which implies that the `` tumor-antigen '' DNA is transcribed by the host Mf . 
As a model system we used the naturally occurring gp100 tumor antigen and b-galactosidase as an artiﬁcial tumor antigen . 
Both cDNAs , inserted in a eukaryotic expression vector , were used for transforming SL7207 and SL7207DyejE . 
Although ex vivo analysis conﬁrmed a superiority of SL7207DyejE compared with SL7207 in immune response induction , this effect did not become obvious in the tumorbearing host .

Mice and Tumors
METHODS
C57BL6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from WIGA ( Sulzfeld , Germany ) . 
Animals were kept under speciﬁc pathogenfree conditions . 
They were fed sterilized food and water ad libitum . 
Animals were used for experiments at the age of 8 to 10 weeks . 
The C57BL6-derived melanoma line B16F144 was used for cloning of the murine gp100 cDNA as described .28 The BALB/c-derived renal cell carcinoma line RENCA45 and the BALB/c-derived leukemia line YC846 were co-transfected with the lacZ cDNA containing plasmid pVAX ( Invitrogen ) and the pcDNA3 vector containing the neomycin resistance gene ( RENCA-ßGal , YC8-ßGal ) by electroporation ( 1050 mF , 260 V ) . 
Transfected cells were selected by growth in G418-containing medium ( 500 mg/mL ) . 
Surviving cells were cloned by limiting dilution . 
Expression was tested by X-Gal staining .43 For in vivo experiments B16F1 , RENCA-ßGal , and YC8-ßGal were used throughout . 
For in vitro experiments B16F1 , RENCA , RENCA-ßGal , YC8 , YC8-ßGal , and the NK target YAC were used . 
All lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS . 
When conﬂuent , adherent growing lines ( B16F1 , RENCA , RENCA-ßGal ) were trypsinized and cultures were split 1:3 . 
Monoclonal Antibodies and Flow Cytometry
The following mAbs were used : YTA 3.1.2 ( anti-CD4 ) , YTS169 .4.2.1 ( anti-CD8 ) , YBM 6.1.10 ( anti-Mac-1 ) , and 33D1 ( anti-DC ) . 
The hybridomas have been obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures ( Salisbury , England ) . 
Anti-CD25 , anti-CD28 , anti-CD16 / CD32 , biotinylated anti-IL2 , anti-IL4 , anti-IL6 , anti-IL10 , anti-IL12 , anti-IFNg , anti-TNFa and secondary , dye-labeled ( FITC or PE ) antibodies were obtained commercially ( Pharmingen , Hamburg , Germany ) . 
For ﬂow cytometry 3 to 5 3 105 cells were stained according to standard protocols . 
When assaying cytokineexpressing cells , lymphocytes were ﬁxed with formaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS/1 % Tween-20 . 
Fluorescence was determined using a FACStar ( Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) . 
Lymphocyte Preparation
Lymph nodes and spleen were prepared aseptically and collected in PBS . 
Peritoneal exudate cells were collected by ﬂushing the peritoneal cavity with 3 mL PBS containing 20 U heparin . 
Spleen and lymph nodes were meshed through ﬁne gauze , spleen cells and lymph node cells were washed twice in PBS and were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics , 10 % fetal calf serum , glutamine , 10 mM HEPES buffer , and 5 3 1025 M 2-mercaptoethanol ( RPMI-s ) . 
Transformation of Salmonella typhimurium aroA (SL7207 and SL7207DyejE)
The attenuated Salmonella typhimurium aroA strains SL7207 ( SL ) and SL7207-yejE ( SLDyejE ) have been described previously .47 The yejE gene has been described to interfere with MHC class I presentation . 
The gene has been deleted in SL-yejE by a one-step gene inactivation method .48 SL and SLDyejE were grown in LB medium . 
Competent bacteria were transformed with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVAX1 ( SL-mock , SLDyejE-mock ) or with pVAXmgp100 ( SL-gp100 , SLDyejE-gp100 ) or with pVAX containing the lacZ gene cDNA ( Invitrogen ) ( SL-lacZ , SLDyejE-lacZ ) by electroporation ( 2,500 V , 25 mF ) . 
Transformation was controlled by selection with kanamycin . 
After 1 hour at 37 C in 
LB medium , cells were cultured overnight on agar plates containing 50 mg/mL kanamycin . 
In Vitro Assays
Proliferative activity of lymph node cells was evaluated by culturing titrated numbers of cells ( 2 3 105 to 2.5 3 104/well ) in the absence or presence of 100 mg/mL gp100 peptide mix ( H2-Kb motif : GSQSYVPL , TWGKYWQV , VLYRYGSF , QRRSFLPV , H2-Db motif : EGSRNQDWL , GLGENSPLL , LRVINDGPTL , HFLRNHPLI ) or 100 mg/mL b-galactosidase ( ßGal ) or with lysates of C57BL6 or BALB/C lymph node cells or lysates of B16F1 cells , RENCA cells , RENCA-ßGal cells , YC8 cells , YC8-ßGal cells ( lysate of 1 3 106 cells/mL ) in 96-well round-bottom plates . 
Cells were cultured for 3 days , with 3H-thymidine ( 10 mCi/mL ) added during the last 16 hours of culture . 
Plates were harvested using an automatic harvester and 3H-thymidine incorporation was evaluated in a b-counter . 
For the activation of lymphokine-activated killer cells , spleen cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of 50 U/ml IL-2 . 
Macrophage activity ( Mf ) was determined after seeding peritoneal exudate cells in 96-well ﬂat-bottom plates and washing out nonadherent cells after 2 hours of incubation at 37 C , 5 % CO2 in air . 
Cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) activity was determined after culturing lymph node cells for 10 days in the presence of 10 U/mL IL-2 plus either the gp100 peptide mix or ßGal or cell lysates ( as described above ) . 
Cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer cells , Mf , and CTLs was performed according to the protocol described by Matzinger .49 In brief , target cells were labeled overnight with 3H-thymidine ( 10 mCi/mL ) and were seeded ( 104 cells/well ) after washing on titrated numbers ( 10 3 105 to 6 3 104 ) of effector cells in 96-well microtiter plates . 
After incubation for 4 to 6 hours ( Mf , 8 hours ) at 37 C , plates were harvested and the remaining radioactivity was determined in a b-counter . 
Cytotoxicity is presented as % cytotoxicity = 100 3 ( counts in control wells 2 counts in test wells ) : ( counts in control wells ) . 
The spontaneous release of B16F1 , YC8 , YC8-ßGal , RENCA , RENCA-ßGal , and YAC cells was in the range of 6 % to 12 % ; the spontaneous release of lymphoblasts ( lymph node cells cultured for 48 hours in the presence of 1 mg/mL ConA ) was in the range of 12 % to 20 % . 
SDs of triplicate cultures were in the range of 3 % to 5 % . 
Vaccination and Tumor Growth
For oral vaccination , transformed SL and SLDyejE were cultured overnight in LB medium containing 2 % NaCl and 50 mg/mL kanamycin at 37 C . 
After determination of OD600 ( OD600 1 roughly corresponds to 1 3 108 SL or SLDyejE/mL ) , bacteria were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm and washed twice with PBS . 
Bacteria were resuspended in PBS ( containing 10 % bicarbonate , pH 9.6 ) , pH 8.3 to 8.5 , to neutralize the acid pH of the stomach . 
Mice received 1 to 2 3 108 bacteria in 100 ml via probing . 
Vaccination was performed in 3-week time intervals . 
Mice were vaccinated twice in advance of tumor cell application and received the third vaccination at the time of tumor cell application . 
The vaccination schedule was maintained after tumor cell application . 
C57BL6 mice received a subcutaneous ( s.c. ) or intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of 1 3 104 B16F1 cells . 
BALB/C mice received an s.c. or i.p. injection of 5 3 103 RENCA-ßGal cells or an intravenous ( i.v. ) or i.p. injection of 1 3 103 YC8-ßGal cells . 
Subcutaneous tumor growth was controlled by measuring the mean diameter twice per week . 
Intraperitoneal tumor growth was controlled by palpation of the abdomen and estimation of the intraperitoneal tumor mass twice per week . 
Mice were killed when the i.p. tumor mass reached a mean diameter of 2.5 cm or when animals became anemic , cachetic , or short of breath after i.v. tumor cell application . 
These time points were deﬁned as survival time . 
Statistical Analysis
Signiﬁcance of differences was calculated according to the Student t test ( in vitro assays ) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test ( in vivo assays ) . 
P , 0.01 was considered signiﬁcant . 
RESULTS
Monocyte and T-Cell Activation After Vaccination With SL Versus SLDyejE
Salmonella typhimurium transverse the intestinal epi-7 ,13 thelium and invade macrophages as their natural host . 
Thus , attenuated strains with a limited survival time appear well suited as a vaccine carrier . 
Because bacteria , similar to viruses , can develop immune escape mechanisms ,32,33 knowledge of immune evasive genes is important to improve the vaccination efﬁcacy . 
We explored whether a mutant of the yejE operon , which somehow appears to protect Salmonella in the phagosome 42 from degradation by the host cell , can increase the efﬁcacy of tumor vaccination . 
We ﬁrst tested the impact of SL vaccination on immune cell activation in the tumor-free mouse to see whether deletion of the yejE operon results in improved responsiveness . 
Mice received two oral applications of either SL or SLDyejE , which had been transformed with the empty vector or with the same vector containing the lacZ gene or the murine gp100 gene . 
Spleen cells , lymph node cells , and peritoneal exudate cells were collected 1 week after the second vaccination to evaluate expression of activation markers and inﬂammatory cytokines as well as proliferative and cytotoxic activity . 
Expression of the T-cell activation markers CD25 and CD28 was upregulated in spleen cells , lymph node cells , and peritoneal exudate cells irrespective of whether the mice received SL or SLDyejE and whether the vector contained a `` tumor antigen '' cDNA . 
Thus , SL by themselves induce T-cell activation . 
However , mainly in the spleen , activation marker expression was strikingly upregulated when mice received SLDyejE compared with SL ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Further evidence for immune activation by SL vaccination was obtained by evaluating intracellular cytokine expression in peritoneal exudate cells . 
The analysis of IL-12 , a proinﬂammatory cytokine mainly secreted by Mf , revealed upregulation by vaccination with SL/SLDyejE , which was further increased by vaccination with lacZ or gp100 cDNA carrying SLDyejE . 
A similar expression proﬁle was seen for the inﬂammatory cytokine IFN-g , secreted by Mf as well as T cells . 
FIGURE 1 . 
T-cell activation and cytokine expression by vaccination with Salmonella typhimurium : comparison between SL7207 and SL7207DyejE . 
BALB/c mice received two oral applications at a 3-week interval of either PBS or 2 3 108 SL or SLDyejE or SL-lacZ or SLDyejE-lacZ ; C57BL6 mice received either PBS or 2 3 108 SL or SLDyejE or SL-gp100 or SLDyejE-gp100 ( as there were no signiﬁcant differences between BALB/c and C57BL6 mice , only the latter two groups of the C57BL6 mice are shown ) . 
Mice were killed 10 days after the second vaccination . 
The percentage of ( A ) CD25 + and CD28 + spleen cells , lymph node cells , and peritoneal exudate cells and ( B ) IL-10 + , IL-12 + , and IFN-g + - expressing peritoneal exudate cells is shown . 
Signiﬁcant differences ( P , 0.01 ) in the mean 6 SD of 3 mice/group are indicated by s ( vaccinated vs. nonvaccinated ) or an asterisk ( SLDyejE vs. SL ) . 
There was a tendency toward higher expression in mice vaccinated with SL/SLDyejE carrying tumor antigen cDNA . 
Expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 also appeared to be of interest . 
IL-10 expression was increased in vaccinated mice ; however , the presence of tumor antigen cDNA obviously exerted no major effect ( see Fig. 1B ) . 
With the exception of a relative increase in the percentage of Mf in the peritoneal cavity , the distribution between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , B cells , NK cells , and Mf was unchanged in lymphoid organs ( data not shown ) . 
These ﬁndings provided a ﬁrst indication for T-cell activation by oral SL/SLDyejE application . 
The higher level of CD25 + / CD28 + spleen cells in SL/SLDyejE-lacZ or - gp100 vaccinated mice could be indicative for induction of a tumor-antigen-speciﬁc response ; the higher level in SLDyejE vaccinated mice might indicate SLDyejE to be more immunogenic/less immunosuppressive than SL . 
We next assessed the functional activity of the activated T cells ( i.e. , for proliferative and cytotoxic activity ) . 
The oral application of SL or SLDyejE exerted no signiﬁcant effect on the overall proliferative activity of spleen cells ( data not shown ) and lymph node cells , as evaluated by 3H-thymidine incorporation after stimulation with autologous lymphocytes . 
Also , empty vector-transformed SL had a weak or no measurable impact on the proliferative response toward ßGal or gp100 peptides . 
However , the proliferative response toward ßGal and gp100 peptides was signiﬁcantly increased when mice had been vaccinated with lacZ or gp100 cDNA transformed SL/SLDyejE . 
Deletion of the yejE gene exerted no effect ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This ﬁrst evidence toward an efﬁcient `` antigen-speciﬁc '' vaccination by SL and SLDyejE was conﬁrmed when evaluating CTL activity after 1 week of in vitro ( re ) stimulation . 
To exclude a major contribution of NK cells , all CTL assays were performed in the presence of a ﬁve-fold excess of unlabeled YAC cells as cold target NK inhibitors . 
Target cells have been ßGal expressing YC8 and RENCA cells ; mock-transfected YC8 and RENCA cells served as controls . 
For evaluating the gp100 response , gp100 expressing B16F1 cells served as target and C57BL6 lymphoblasts as control . 
Three observations should be particularly noted . 
First , nonspeciﬁc bystander cytotoxic activity was increased in SLDyejE compared with PBS or SL vaccinated mice . 
Second , YC8-ßGal , RENCA-ßGal , and B16F1 cells were more efﬁciently lysed compared with control cells ; in other words , vaccination with transformed SL and SLDyejE apparently sufﬁced for the activation of antigen-speciﬁc CTLs . 
Third , vaccination with transformed SLDyejE compared with SL apparently was slightly more efﬁcient in activating antigen-speciﬁc CTLs ( see Fig. 2B ) . 
Thus , a tumor antigen introduced via SL carrying a eukaryotic expression vector induced an efﬁcient proliferative and cytotoxic T-cell response with only a minor advantage of the yejE operon deletion . 
As Mf are the prime host of SL , it was also important to explore the impact of SL vaccination on Mf activity . 
Mf from vaccinated mice exerted a higher cytotoxic activity than Mf from nonvaccinated mice . 
Irrespective of whether SL were transformed with an empty vector or a tumor antigen cDNA carrying vector , vaccination with SLDyejE induced a signiﬁcantly higher cytolytic Mf response than vaccination with SL ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The latter effect , although less pronounced , accounted also for NK activity , which was evaluated after overnight incubation of spleen cells in IL-2-containing medium using YAC as target cells ( see Fig. 3B ) . 
These ﬁndings indicated that SLDyejE induced T-cell , NK-cell , and Mf activation more efﬁciently than SL in most instances . 
However , when the antigen cDNA had been inserted in a eukaryotic expression vector , differences in `` antigenspeciﬁc '' responses after vaccination with SL versus SLDyejE were nonexistent or minor . 
This implies that presentation of the eukaryotically transcribed antigen by Mf is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the yejE operon deletion . 
FIGURE 2 .

A , Proliferative activity of lymph node cells from control and vaccinated mice ( as described in Fig. 1 ) in response to autologous irradiated lymph node cells , ßGal ( 100 mg/mL ) , or a mixture of gp100 peptides ( 100 mg/mL ) is shown .

B , Lymph node cells of vaccinated mice ( as described in Fig. 1 ) were cultured in the presence of 10 U IL-2 / mL plus either ßGal ( 100 mg/mL ) or a mixture of gp100 peptides ( 100 mg/mL ) . 
Cytotoxic activity was evaluated in a 6-hour assay with the indicated 3H-thymidine-labeled target cells and a 5-fold excess of YAC as cold target cells . 
Mean 6 SD of triplicates at an E : T ratio of 50:1 . 
A , B , Signiﬁcant differences ( P , 0.01 ) are indicated by s ( vaccinated vs. nonvaccinated ) or an asterisk ( SLDyejE vs. SL ) or a ﬁlled asterisk ( SL/SLDyejE vs. SL-lacZ/gp100/SLDyejE-lacZ / gp100 ) . 
All experiments were repeated three times . 
Representative examples are shown . 
To see whether there are major differences between a solid tumor and a leukemia , the efﬁcacy of SL vaccination was tested using lacZ cDNA transfected YC8 and RENCA cells . 
Because bGal is a xenoantigen , which we used as a surrogate tumor antigen , we included as a third model the B16F1 melanoma line that expresses gp100 , a low immunogenic tumor-associated antigen . 
Mice received two vaccinations before tumor cell application . 
Tumors were applied intraperitoneally to control for local response induction , and particularly for the efﬁcacy of the innate immune system , taking into account the abundant presence of Mf at this site . 
In a parallel setting the tumor cells were deposited s.c. or , in case of the leukemia , i.v. to mimic more closely the clinical situation of vaccination in patients with cancer and to control whether SL vaccination sufﬁces for inducing a systemic response . 
In all settings the potential beneﬁt of a deletion of the yejE operon was evaluated ( Fig. 4 , Table 1 ) . 
First , vaccination with transformed SL or SLDyejE was of beneﬁt for tumor-challenged mice . 
This accounted for the renal cell carcinoma , the malignant melanoma , and the leukemia . 
The rate of persistently tumor-free mice was highest after the application of RENCA-ßGal ; the most pronounced prolongation of the survival time was seen in YC8-ßGal-bearing mice . 
Second , the therapeutic effect was at least partially `` tumor antigen-speciﬁc . '' 
Vaccination with SL/SLDyejE transformed with an empty vector exerted no effect on the survival of mice bearing RENCA or B16F1 , and only a minor effect on the survival of mice bearing YC8-bGal . 
Notably , in this setting SLDyejE were more efﬁcient than SL . 
Third , SL or SLDyejE vaccination obviously induced a systemic response ; that is , the survival rate was improved when the tumors were given i.p. , i.v. , or s.c. However , the increase in the survival time was less pronounced in mice with s.c. tumors or lung metastases . 
Fourth , deletion of the DyejE operon had no major impact on survival time and survival rate when SL were transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector carrying a `` tumor antigen '' cDNA . 
Fifth , in the vaccinated mice that died with the tumor , tumor growth started with delay , but later the tumor growth rate did not differ from the one in mock-vaccinated mice . 
We interpret the data as follows . 
Deletion of the yejE operon does not create a special vaccination advantage when SL are transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector . 
SL vaccination sufﬁces for induction of a systemic response , which , however , requires repeated and long-lasting vaccination schedules . 
Natural defense mechanisms such as NK cells and Mf may be more effective against leukemic than solid tumors , and the lytic machinery of NK and Mf possibly proﬁts from yejE deletion . 
All three tumors obviously exert active counterregulatory effects . 
This is deduced from the observation that tumor growth , although starting with delay in vaccinated animals , progressed rather unimpaired thereafter . 
To support these hypotheses , we evaluated the immune response proﬁle in mice bearing small tumors and in late tumor-bearing mice .

Representative examples are shown . 
Efﬁcacy of Vaccination with Transformed SL and SLDyejE on Tumor Growth in the Peritoneal Cavity , at a Subcutaneous Site , and in the Lung 
Repeated Vaccination with Transformed SL
and SLDyejE Sufﬁces for the Induction of a Systemic T-Cell Response In early tumor-bearing mice ( ie , before visible tumor growth ) , vaccination with transformed SL was accompanied by an increase in activated T cells as shown for CD25 expression ( Fig. 5A ) and a strong increase in IL-12 , IFN-g and also in IL-10 cytokine expressing lymph node cells , as shown for YC8-ßGal and B16F1 tumor-bearing mice ( see Fig. 5B ) . 
There was no consistent difference between vaccination with SL versus SLDyejE . 
Also , lymph node cell activation was observed whether the tumor was applied at the site of vaccination ( i.p. ) ( data not shown ) or at a distant site . 
Similar to vaccinated , tumor-free mice , vaccination with transformed SL or SLDyejE had a minor effect on the proliferative activity of spleen cells ( data not shown ) and lymph node cells toward tumor cells not expressing the antigen used for vaccination . 
On the contrary , a strong proliferative response was observed when lymphocytes were restimulated with tumor cells carrying the nominal antigen . 
The nominal antigen , in the absence of tumor cells , induced the most profound proliferative activity ( Fig. 6A ) . 
This was shown for the proliferative response toward YC8-ßGal and RENCA-ßGal cells versus ßGal and for B16F1 cells versus gp100 peptides . 
We also noted a signiﬁcant increase in `` antigenspeciﬁc '' CTL activity in the early YC8-ßGal , RENCA-ßGal , and B16F1 tumor-bearing hosts ( see Fig. 6B ) . 
There was a minor increase in `` bystander '' cytolytic activity after vaccination with SLDyejE-lacZ ; that is , YC8 cells were more efﬁciently lysed by lymph node cells from SLDyejE-lacZ vaccinated compared with SL vaccinated mice . 
Also , YC8-ßGal cells were more efﬁciently lysed after vaccination with SLDyejE-lacZ compared with SL-lacZ . 
No signiﬁcant difference was seen between lymph node cells from SLDyejE-lacZ/gp100 and SL-lacZ/gp100 vaccinated mice with respect to the lysis of RENCA-bGal and B16F1 . 
Finally , CTL activation was independent of whether the tumor cells were applied i.p. ( data not shown ) , s.c. , or i.v. Vaccination of tumor-free mice had provided evidence that SLDyejE may be more effective in the activation of Mf and NK cells than SL . 
This suggestion could be strengthened by the analysis of NK and Mf cytotoxicity in early tumorbearing mice . 
In particular , YC8-bGal cells were more efﬁciently lysed by Mf and NK cells from SLDyejE than from SL vaccinated mice ( see Fig. 6C , D ) . 
In addition , RENCA-bGal and B16F1 cells were also more efﬁciently lysed by Mf and NK cells from SL/SLDyejE vaccinated as compared with nonvaccinated mice . 
This accounted for i.v. or s.c. tumor cell application . 
We had pointed out repeatedly that vaccination with SL and SLDyejE induced a systemic T-cell response and that no differences could be seen in effector functions between mice carrying the tumor i.p. , i.v. , or s.c. Surprisingly , this was different for NK and Mf activity . 
After i.p. tumor cell application , NK cells and Mf of SL or SLDyejE vaccinated mice exerted no increased cytolytic activity except for a minor increase in the lysis of YC8-bGal cells ( see Fig. 6C , D ) . 
The ex vivo analysis conﬁrmed that both SL strains sufﬁced to induce a systemic T-cell response against nominal tumor antigens with a considerable contribution of NK cells and Mf . 
The latter were more efﬁciently activated by SLDyejE than by SL . 
Surprisingly , NK and Mf activity was strongly mitigated after i.p. tumor cell application . 
This locally restricted mitigation could be indicative for immunosuppressive features of the growing tumor . 
However , the obvious breakdown of the vaccination efﬁcacy in 50 % to 80 % of vaccinated mice did not depend on the tumor localization . 
Thus , an additional contribution to immunosuppression by the vaccine itself became likely . 
To control for the hypothesis , immune reactivity was evaluated in late tumor-bearing mice , which at that time had received four or ﬁve SL applications .

Nonresponsiveness of Immune Cells of Late Tumor-Bearing Mice
Mice were killed when tumors reached a mean diameter of about 1 cm ( depending on the tumor , between 4 and 8 weeks after tumor cell inoculation ) . 
At this stage , mice were not cachectic and , with the exception of RENCA-ßGal-bearing mice , increased numbers of spleen cells ( data not shown ) and lymph node cells were recovered from vaccinated mice ( Fig. 7A ) . 
However , there was a tendency toward a reduction in expression of T-cell activation markers ( CD25 and CD28 + ) ( data not shown ) . 
In nonvaccinated mice , IL-10 , IL-12 , and IFN-g cytokine expression was in the same range as in early tumorbearing mice . 
On the contrary , cytokine expression was strikingly reduced in lymph node cells from late versus early tumorbearing , vaccinated mice . 
Deletion of the yejE operon did not prevent cytokine downregulation ( see Fig. 7B ) . 
The most striking changes were seen with respect to proliferating and cytotoxic T cells . 
The proliferative activity of lymph node cells from SL and SLDyejE vaccinated mice was mostly below or in the range of lymph node cells from nonvaccinated mice cultured in the absence of a nominal antigen ( data not shown ) . 
In B16F1 and RENCA-bGal-bearing mice , T-cell cytotoxicity was largely abolished . 
It was also reduced in YC8-ßGal-bearing mice . 
In addition , bystander killing of YC8 and RENCA cells as well as of C57BL6 lymphoblasts was hardly detectable ( see Fig. 7C ) . 
Compared with early tumor-bearing mice , NK and Mf cytotoxic activity was also signiﬁcantly reduced after repeated vaccination with SL or SLDyejE . 
The only exceptions were NK cells from SLDyejE-lacZ vaccinated mice , whose activity toward YC8-bGal remained elevated ( see Fig. 7D ) . 
Taken together , both transformed SL7207 and SL7202DyejE induced a `` tumor-antigen '' speciﬁc response . 
Although SL were transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector , deletion of yejE supported the cytolytic activity of Mf , but also of NK cells and to a minor degree of CTL . 
However , although some vaccinated mice did not develop tumors , others suddenly died with rapidly growing tumors . 
The latter feature may be partly due to immunosuppressive features of the tumor itself , but it is obviously supported by the vaccine . 
This is deduced from the observation that at a late stage of tumor growth , immunoreactivity of vaccinated mice was reduced to the level or even below that of nonvaccinated mice .

DISCUSSION
Salmonella typhimurium are gram-negative bacteria that cause systemic disease by their capacity to survive and rep-licate within macrophages .7,12 As macrophages are equipped with potent bactericidal activities ,32 SL have adapted to escape their host 's defense .32,33 Although knowledge on escape mechanisms is still scarce ,8,50 vaccination protocols using live attenuated SL have been developed that induce a potent immune response and can protect from virulent bacteria .51 -- 53 Because transformed attenuated Salmonella typhimurium provide an easily accessible and applicable drug , SL-based vaccines are also considered in cancer therapy .9,19,30,31 In addition , it was thought that transforming SL with a eukaryotic expression vector might circumvent potential defects in tumor antigen presentation caused by the bacteria 's escape mechanisms .30 In this report , we intended to experimentally support this hypothesis . 
We have recently identiﬁed the yej operon to interfere with MHC class I-mediated presentation by SL-infected Mf .42 Deletion of yejE was accompanied by a signiﬁcantly increased response toward a prokaryotically expressed nominal antigen ( OVA ) that had been introduced via transformed SLDyejE .42 Here we controlled whether yejE deletion could also be advantageous when SL were transformed with a eukaryotic expression vector . 
Our ex vivo data provided evidence for induction of a stronger immune response by vaccination with SLDyejE , mainly with respect to Mf and NK cytotoxicity . 
This accounted for three tumor lines of different histology and was most pronounced for the YC8 lymphoma line . 
On the contrary , we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in survival time and survival rate depending on whether mice were vaccinated with transformed SL or SLDyejE . 
Because SL are immunogenic by themselves and SL degradation products are potent antigens ,21,54 -- 56 we ﬁrst evaluated whether the immune response toward the SL and the empty vector might not override the response against a `` tumor antigen , '' which in the present study have been ßGal and gp100 . 
Although we did not evaluate responsiveness against deﬁned SL antigens , vaccination with SL transformed with an empty vector obviously induced an immune response . 
There was a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of CD28 + and CD25 + cells , which in lymphoid organs of vaccinated mice mostly were freshly activated rather than regulatory T cells ( ie , they were CD1522 ) ( data not shown ) . 
The percentage of cytokine-expressing cells was elevated and the proliferative activity of lymph node cells was strengthened .

were repeated three 
Comparing SL with SL7207DyejE vaccinated mice , we noted in SL7207DyejE vaccinated mice a signiﬁcant increase in CTL bystander killing , a further increase in NK and Mf cytotoxicity , and elevated numbers of IL-10 , IL-12 , and IFN-g expressing peritoneal exudate cells , although the latter did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in all instances . 
These response features are in line with the recent notion that the yejE gene product and the yej operon interfere with MHC class I-mediated presentation by infected Mf42 and thus cause a reduced peptide presentation for CTLs .57 In addition , our in vitro ﬁndings indicate that the yejE gene product also has a bearing on the activation of Mf , NK , and T-helper cells . 
The mechanism whereby yejE inﬂuences activation of the latter cells remains to be explored . 
Yet the theory that Salmonella is confusing the immune system by secreting different peptides that affect various immune cells comes to mind , taking into account that the yej operon encodes for the components of an ABC-type dipeptide/oligopeptide transport system .42 Given the increased responsiveness after vaccination with SLDyejE , it became of particular interest to see whether deletion of this gene would have also an impact on the response toward a tumor antigen , if the latter is transcribed by the host rather than by the SL . 
Neither in the tumor-free nor in the early tumor-bearing host did the proliferative response toward ßGal and gp100 differ signiﬁcantly based on whether mice were vaccinated with SL or SLDyejE . 
With the exception of the lymphoid tumor YC8 , this also accounted for the CTL response . 
Thus , although being advantageous with respect to nonadaptive immune and bystander T-cell activation , yejE operon deletion did not provide an advantage in peptide presentation , when the gene was transcribed by the host . 
To our surprise , the overall increase in immune responsiveness of SL or SLDyejE vaccinated mice had vanished in early tumor-bearing animals when the tumor cells were injected i.p. Because there is no reason for the efﬁcacy of vaccination to particularly vanish in the peritoneal cavity , we interpreted the latter ﬁnding as a consequence of tumor-mediated immunosuppression , which might more rapidly become effective at the local ( i.p. ) versus the more inaccessible ( s.c. ) site . 
The growth proﬁle of tumors in vaccinated mice strengthened the suspicion of immunosuppression . 
While some mice remained tumor-free , the majority of vaccinated mice developed tumors , although with delay . 
Notably , the tumor growth rate did not differ from the one in nonvaccinated animals . 
Although immu-nosuppressive features have been described for RENCA ,58 B16F1 ,28,59 and YC860 cells , the unaltered growth rate in repeatedly vaccinated mice argued against immunosuppression only by the tumor . 
To control whether the vaccination regimen may contribute to the breakdown of the immune system , the immunoreactivity of late tumor-bearing mice , which had received the vaccine four or ﬁve times , was compared with that of early tumor-bearing mice . 
Although the late tumor-bearing animals were not cachectic , immune responsiveness was strongly impaired . 
There remained no T-helper response , and even bystander proliferative activity was most strongly impaired ( data not shown ) . 
The vaccination-induced increase in cytokine expression had completely vanished , while cytokine expression remained unaltered in nonvaccinated , tumor-bearing mice . 
The same accounted for Mf and NK cytotoxicity . 
Solely in 
YC8-ßGal-bearing mice , a low level of CTL and NK activity above that of nonvaccinated mice was observed . 
This obviously vaccine-induced immunosuppression was independent of whether SL were transformed with the empty vector or a tumor antigen cDNA carrying vector . 
Also , deletion of the yejE gene apparently did not prevent SL-mediated immunosuppression . 
It remains to be explored whether SL-mediated immu-nosuppression is due to additional immunosuppressive operons or to exhaustion of the immune system by the repeated activation . 
An alternative explanation that might account for the differences between the ex vivo and the in vivo data is the elimination of the vector by neutralizing antibodies following the ﬁrst vaccine application . 
It is well known in the ﬁeld of vaccination that neutralizing antibodies , especially of the IgA type , and other speciﬁc T-cell responses evolve after the ﬁrst vector encounter and eliminate the efﬁcacy of the following vaccine applications .61,62 The elimination of the SLDyejE vector may be faster than its parental control due to its enhanced immunogenicity . 
Thus , even though the in vivo data show similar results , the overall effectiveness of the SLDyejE might be superior , taking into account the rate of elimination of both vectors . 
Taken together , vaccination with attenuated transformed SL could well provide a means for cancer immunotherapy . 
As far as the tumor antigen cDNA is inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector , deletion of the yejE gene is of some advantage during induction of an immune response , which exceeds that induced by yejE-competent SL . 
However , irrespective of the mode of SL transformation and irrespective of the yejE gene deletion , repeated SL application is accompanied by a reduction in responsiveness . 
Thus , further studies on the immunoregulatory mechanisms of SL are required for deﬁning mutants that provide an optimized vaccine .
