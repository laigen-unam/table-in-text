Abstract 
Virulence genes regulated by the SsrA/B system are indispensable for systemic disease in BALB/c mice . 
The role of this regulating system in the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhimurium infections in pigs is not documented . 
In the present study , the interactions of Salmonella Typhimurium and an ssrA/B mutant were compared in vitro and in vivo . 
The ssrA/B mutant strain displayed decreased Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 ( SPI-2 ) expression levels , showed a replication defect in mouse macrophages and was attenuated in a mouse model after oral inoculation . 
Using real time qRT-PCR and a porcine ileal loop model , it was shown that the ssrA/B mutant strain was not signiﬁcantly attenuated in overall virulence and SPI-1 expression in speciﬁc . 
Flowcytometric analysis demonstrated that the ssrA/B mutant strain was defective in intracellular replication in porcine macrophages . 
After oral inoculation of piglets with the wild type strain or the ssrA/B mutant strain , the animals of both groups excreted Salmonella and were colonized by Salmonella to the same extent . 
In an intravenous mixed infection model , the ssrA/B mutant strain was defective in the colonization of several internal organs . 
These results suggest that the ssrA/B gene of Salmonella Typhimurium plays a limited role in the persistent intestinal colonization of pigs .

1. Introduction
Salmonellosis is one of the leading zoonoses in the world . 
Human infections with non-typhoidal Salmo-nella are generally foodborne and are a major public health concern . 
Over the last two decades , the emergence of Salmonella strains carrying multiple antibiotic resistance genes has led to an increased risk for hospitalization , invasive illness , and death . 
This is particularly the case for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium ; Velge et al. , 2005 ) . 
Second to Salmonella Enteritidis , Salmonella Typhimurium is the most common serotype associated with human salmonellosis in Europe ( Fisher , 2004 ) . 
Due to a drop in Salmonella Enteritidis infections in poultry in 2005 and 2006 ( Collard et al. , in press ) , the relative importance of Salmonella Typhimurium infections in pigs might increase the next few years . 
Salmonella Typhimurium is the most frequently isolated serotype from pigs and pork ( Anonymous , 2004 ) . 
Infected pigs can shed Salmonella for at least 28 weeks ( Wood et al. , 1989 ) . 
These carrier pigs are a vast reservoir of Salmonella Typhimurium and pose an important threat to animal and human health ( Berends et al. , 1997 ) . 
The mechanism underlying this carrier state of infection is unknown . 
The virulence genes located on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 ( SPI-2 ) , which encodes a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) , may play a role in the persistence of Salmonella in food-producing animals since these genes are indispensable for the induction of disease and systemic persistence in mice ( Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Hensel et al. , 1998 ) . 
The two-component regulatory system , ssrA/B , responds to environmental signals ( Löber et al. , 2006 ) and controls the expression of the type III secretion system and the secreted effector proteins . 
Through interaction with the intracellular trafﬁc in macrophages and dendritic cells , the injected SPI-2 effector proteins manage to create a safe niche for the salmonellae inside the phagocyte . 
It becomes increasingly clear that the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections varies depending on the host -- strain combination ( Pasmans et al. , 2003 ; Morgan et al. , 2004 ) . 
Therefore , pathogenesis studies that use both the host species of interest and relevant Salmonella strains are of crucial importance . 
The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of SsrA/B to the intestinal and systemic colonization and the intestinal persistence of pigs by a Salmonella Typhimurium ﬁeld strain . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids
Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a was isolated from a pig stool sample on a pig farm with a persistent Salmonella problem and was used as the wild type strain ( WT ) in which all mutant strains were constructed . 
The construction and characterization of the non-polar deletion mutant in the major SPI-1 regulatory protein HilA , has been described before ( Boyen et al. , 2006a , c ) . 
A mutant strain in which the ssrA gene was deleted ( designated SsrA/B ) was constructed accordingly . 
This region also contains a promoter region of the ssrB gene , thus resulting in the functional destruction of the complete ssrA/B system . 
Brieﬂy , ssrA was ﬁrst substituted by a PCR-modiﬁed kanamycin resistance cassette with the aid of a helper plasmid encoding the l Red system . 
Primers used to create the PCR-modiﬁed resistance cassettes for the ssrA/B gene were 50-TAGTGATCAAGTGCCAAA - 
GATTTTGCAACAGGCAACTGGAGGGAAG-CATTTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-30 and 50-AAGATCTTATATTCTTTCATTTTGCTGCCCTCG - CGAAAATTAAGATAATACATATGAATATCCTCC-TTAG-30 . 
The mutant allele was subsequently transduced , using bacteriophage P22HTint , in a fresh wild type Salmonella background to discount effects on virulence due to unlinked mutations . 
In the last step , the antibiotic resistance cassette was eliminated using the helperplasmid pCP20 . 
The targeted gene was completely deleted from the start codon till the stop codon . 
This was conﬁrmed by sequencing . 
For all in vitro experiments and the loop assays , the WT and SsrA/B strains were used . 
For the in vivo assays , an invasive , spontaneous nalidixic acid resistant derivative ( WTnal ) was used . 
The ssrA / B : : kan mutation was moved by P22 transduction into the WTnal strain , resulting in the SsrA/Bkan/nal strain . 
This strain was used in the mixed in vivo assay . 
For the oral infection model , the kanamycin resistance cassette was eliminated as described above , resultin in the SsrA/Bnal strain . 
At different stages of the construction , bacteriophage P22 sensitivity was tested to conﬁrm the smooth phenotype . 
For ﬂowcytometric analysis , ﬂuorescence micro-scopy and confocal imaging , the pFPV25 .1 plasmid expressing green ﬂuorescent protein under the constitutive promoter of rpsM was used ( Valdivia and Falkow , 1996 ) . 
2.2. Cell cultures and growing conditions
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 or porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages ( PAM ) were used for all experiments . 
PAM were isolated and kept in culture as previously described ( Boyen et al. , 2006a ; Dom et al. , 1994 ) . 
For intracellular survival assays , stationary phase cultures were obtained following growth overnight with aeration in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth and opsonized with serum obtained from Salmonella negative pigs . 
For the mouse infection model , bacterial strains were grown to stationary phase , washed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 10 CFU / 9 ml in PBS . 
The inocula for the oral infection models and the intestinal loop model were prepared as described previously ( Boyen et al. , 2006b ) . 
For the intravenous infection assay , overnight cultures of both strains were assembled , washed three times in PBS and resuspended to obtain 3 10 CFU/ml in PBS .

2.3. SPI-1 and SPI-2 expression studies
The relative expression levels of the hilA ( encoding a major SPI-1 regulator ) , sipA ( encoding a SPI-1 effector ) , ssrA/B ( encoding a major SPI-2 regulator ) and sifB ( encoding a T3SS-2 secreted effector ) genes of the Salmonella Typhimurium wild type strain and the ssrA/B mutant strain were compared in LB broth . 
A hilA mutant strain was used as an internal control . 
Total RNA was extracted from 1 ml of the bacterial culture using the RNeasy mini kit and the RNAprotect bacteria reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) followed by a DNase treatment . 
To quantify the expression of the genes of interest , the quantitative real time reverse transriptase PCR method ( qRT-PCR ) according to ( Botteldoorn et al. , 2006 ) was used . 
Primers used are shown in Supplementary Data 1 . 
As control house keeping genes 16S rRNA , gmk and rpoD were used and the normalisation factor ( NF ) was calculated by using the GeNorm software ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ) . 
2.4. Intestinal loop model
To check the behaviour of the ssrA/B mutant strain during the intestinal phase of infection , an intestinal loop model was performed on 6-week-old piglets . 
This model has been described in detail elsewhere ( Watson et al. , 1995 ; Boyen et al. , 2006c ) . 
In short , intestinal loops of 6 -- 7 cm in length were ligated and inoculated with 1 -- 2 10 CFU Salmonella Typhimurium 9 112910a or its isogenic deletion mutants in hilA and ssrA/B . 
The hilA mutant strain was used as an internal control . 
Approximately 10 ml of blood was removed from the piglets to isolate the polymorphonuclear leucocytes ( PMNs ) . 
The isolated PMNs were labeled with Indium and reinjected intravenously . 
The inﬂux 111 of PMNs in the intestinal wall and in the lumen of the gut , as assessed by the counts per minute ( cpm ) emitted from Indium-labelled PMNs within each loop , was 111 recorded 12 h after injection of the loops . 
2.5. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular replication
To assess the intramacrophagal replication deﬁcit of the ssrA/B mutant strain , RAW 264.7 cells or PAM were seeded in 25 cm culture ﬂasks at a density of 2 approximately 5 10 cells per ﬂask and were 6 allowed to attach overnight . 
The cells were inoculated with the wild type strain or the ssrA/B mutant strain carrying the pFPV25 .1 plasmid , at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 1:1 . 
To synchronize the infection , the ﬂasks were centrifuged at 365 g for 5 min . 
After 25 min incubation at 37 8C under 5 % CO2 , the cells were washed and fresh medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml gentamicin was added . 
After additional 60 min incubation at 37 8C under 5 % CO2 , the cells were washed . 
To assess the initial bacterial load , cells were released using trypsin and maintained on ice , protected from light until use . 
To assess intracellular growth , fresh medium supplemented with 15 mg/ml gentamicin was added and cells were released and handled as described 6 h after inoculation . 
Flow cytometric measurements were made using a FACScanto cytometer ( Becton -- Dickinson TM 
Erembodegem , Belgium ) . 
Macrophages were discri-minated from bacteria and debris based on forward ( FSC ) and side ( SSC ) light scatter . 
GFP ﬂuorescence was recorded using the FL1 channel ( emission wavelength : 515 -- 545 nm ) . 
Data were expressed in arbitrary units and both the average ﬂuorescence and the median ﬂuorescent value of infected macrophages were calculated from the ﬂuorescence histograms using the FACSDiva software ( Becton -- Dickinson , Erembodegem , Belgium ) . 
2.6. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice
Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomly divided in two groups , anesthetized with isoﬂurane and inoculated orally with ca. 1 10 CFU of Salmonella Typhimurium 112910a 8 or Salmonella Typhimurium 112910aDssrA/B . 
On days 1 and 4 after inoculation , a subset of animals of both groups were humanely killed . 
For each animal , cecum , spleen and liver were removed , homogenized and the number of CFU/g tissue was determined on brilliant green agar ( BGA ) plates . 
2.7. Experimental infections of piglets
In the experimental infection studies , 5-week-old piglets , obtained from a serologically negative breeding herd , that were negative for Salmonella at fecal sampling were used . 
Oral experimental infections were performed in piglets as described before ( Boyen et al. , 2006b ) . 
In short , animals of groups 1 and 2 were orally inoculated with ca. 1 10 CFU of Salmonella 7 Typhimurium 112910a or Salmonella Typhimurium 112910aDssrA/B , respectively in 2 ml PBS . 
Group 3 , the negative control group , was sham-inoculated with 2 ml PBS . 
The rectal temperature and the clinical condition were monitored and fresh fecal samples were collected on several days for bacteriological analysis . 
On days 5 and 28 pi , ﬁve piglets of each group were euthanized . 
Samples of several organs were taken for bacteriological analysis . 
All samples were examined for the presence of the Salmonella strains by plating tenfold dilutions on BGA supplemented with 20 mg/ml nalidixic acid . 
If negative at direct plating , the samples were pre-enriched in buffered peptone water , enriched in tetrathionate broth and plated on BGA supplemented with 20 mg/ml nalidixic acid . 
Samples that were negative after direct plating but positive after enrichment were presumed to contain 83 CFU/g . 
Samples that remained negative were presumed to contain 0 CFU/g . 
For the mixed infection assay , 11 experimental animals were intravenously inoculated with approximately 1.5 10 CFU of each strain of a 1:1 mixture 8 of the WTnal and the SsrA/Bkan/nal strains in 0.5 ml PBS . 
The negative control group consisted of three piglets which were sham-inoculated with PBS . 
The Salmonella-inoculated piglets were euthanized on days 1 ( ﬁve piglets ) and 3 ( six piglets ) after inoculation . 
Sham-inoculated piglets were euthanized 3 days after inoculation . 
Samples of tonsils , lung , liver , spleen , kidney , bronchial , mesenterial and ileocecal lymph nodes , ileum and cecum were taken for bacteriological analysis . 
The ileum and cecum tissue samples were separated from their contents and were rinsed in PBS . 
Both the contents and the rinsed intestinal samples were bacteriologically examined . 
All samples were processed as described before ( Boyen et al. , 2006c ) . 
The ratio WTnal/SsrA/Bkan / nal was calculated for all samples derived from each piglet . 
These data were converted logarithmically prior to statistical analysis . 
The appropriate detection limits were used to estimate the minimum ratios when samples were not positive after direct plating . 
2.8. Ethical considerations
The animal work presented here was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Ghent University ( EC 2004/103 and EC 2006/104 ) and in the UK were conducted according to the requirements of the Animal ( scientiﬁc procedures ) Act 1986 . 
2.9. Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were carried out in triplicate with three repeats per experiment , unless otherwise stated . 
The data from the intestinal loops were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance methods , using the SPSS 12.0 software for windows . 
A Student 's t-test was used to determine whether the ﬂow cytometric ﬂuorescence values of both strains differed and to determine whether the log value of the WTnal/SipBkan/nal ratio of the samples was signiﬁcantly different from the log value of the WTnal 
SipBkan/nal ratio of the inoculum . 
In the oral infection assay , statistical analysis was performed using a nonparametric Kruskal -- Wallis test . 
Differences with a Pvalue 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant . 
3. Results
3.1. The ssrA/B mutant strain is attenuated in a BALB/c infection model
SPI-2 deﬁcient Salmonella Typhimurium strains are severely attenuated in virulence in a BALB/c infection model . 
Deletion of the ssrA/B gene resulted in a systemic colonization defect in this model , as shown in Supplementary Data 2 . 
Although the ssrA/B mutant strain and the wild type strain were found in similar numbers in the murine ceca 1 day after inoculation , the ssrA/B mutant strain was found in lower numbers in the ceca 4 days after inoculation , though not statistically signiﬁcant ( P > 0.05 ) . 
The ssrA/B mutant strain was found in signiﬁcantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower numbers in liver and spleen 4 days after inoculation .

The ssrA/B deletion mutant shows impaired intracellular replication in murine and porcine macrophages 
3.2. The ssrA/B mutant strain is defective in SPI-2 expresssion
To check the deletion of ssrA/B and the expression of downstream T3SS-2 - secreted effector genes , the expression levels of ssrA/B and sifB ( Miao and Miller , 2000 ) were measured using qRT-PCR . 
The ssrA/B gene was expressed in the wild type strain and the hilA mutant strain , but not in the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
The expression of sifB was considerably decreased in the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
Both the expression of hilA ( a major SPI-1 regulator ) and sipA ( coding for a SPI-1 effector protein ) were dramatically diminished in the hilA mutant strain , but not in the ssrA/B mutant strain ( Supplementary Data 3 ) . 
3.3. The ssrA/B mutant strain elicits an intestinal inﬂammatory response
In the porcine intestinal loop assays , the virulence of the wild type strain and the ssrA/B mutant strain in the intestinal phase of the infection were compared . 
Twelve hours post inoculation , both the wild type strain and the ssrA/B mutant strain , but not the hilA mutant strain , induced intestinal inﬂammation . 
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in neutrophil inﬂux between the wild type strain and the ssrA/B mutant strain ( P > 0.05 ) . 
These results are shown in Supplementary Data 4 . 
At time point 0 h , both the mean ﬂuorescence and the median ﬂuorescent value of the infected RAW 264.7 cells and PAM were similar for the wild type strain and the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
At 6 h after inoculation , however , both the mean ﬂuorescence and the median ﬂuorescent value of the infected macro-phages was signiﬁcantly higher in the cells infected with the wild type strain , compared to the cells infected with the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
These results are shown in Table 1 .

The average values of three independent experiments S.D. are shown . 
Both the mean and median ﬂuorescent values of the cells infected with the ssrA/B mutant strain at 6 h pi were statistically signiﬁcant lower ( P < 0.05 ) than the values of the cells infected with the wild type strain an are indicated with an asterisk . 
Sham-inoculated control piglets did not develop disease signs and Salmonella was not isolated from any of the samples taken from these animals throughout the experiment . 
The animals from both Salmonella-inoculated groups had a slight increase in temperature during the ﬁrst few days after inoculation and some presented with mild diarrhea . 
The animals of both groups showed a similar fecal excretion pattern ( data not shown ) . 
Two weeks after inoculation , the piglets intermittently shed Salmonella at enrichment level . 
Although during the last few days of the experiment , the ssrA/B mutant strain was shed by fewer animals , this difference was not signiﬁcant due to the low level of shedding reached at this stage of the infection . 
At days 5 and 28 pi , the animals of both groups were infected to the same extent in the gut , the contents of the gut and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( Table 2 ) . 
No signiﬁcant differences ( P > 0.05 ) were seen . 
In addition , no signiﬁcant differences were seen in the colonization of the internal organs , both at days 5 and 28 pi ( P > 0.05 ) . 
However , the low numbers of bacteria in these organs might interfere with a meaningful statistical analysis .

The number of positive tissues in relation to the total number of tissues ( frequency ) and the average number of CFU ( log10 ) S.D. per gram tissue are shown . 
Samples only positive after enrichment were given a value of 83 CFU/g 
In order to get higher numbers of bacteria in the internal organs , we used the intravenous mixed infection model . 
One day after inoculation , both strains were recovered from all pigs inoculated intravenously with a 1:1 mixture of the WTnal and SsrA/Bkan/nal strains . 
The numbers of bacteria in the blood , the heart , the tonsils and the gut samples were very low , impairing a meaningful quantitative comparison between both strains in these organs . 
Bacteria were found in relatively higher numbers , although still low , in the liver , spleen , kidney , lungs and bronchial lymph nodes . 
In these organs , except for the liver , the output ratio WTnal/SsrA/Bkan / nal was not signiﬁcantly different ( P > 0.05 ) from the ratio in the inoculum . 
Three days pi , neither strain could be recovered from the blood samples . 
The number of WTnal bacteria found in most of the organs was comparable with the number of WTnal bacteria found 1 day after inoculation . 
The number of SsrA/Bkan/nal bacteria , however , showed an overall decrease . 
The number of positive lymphoid tissues ( tonsils , gut-associated lymphoid tissue ) was markedly lower for the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
For the kidney , heart , ileal wall and the bronchial and mesenteric lymph nodes , this resulted in an output ratio WTnal/SsrA/Bkan / nal that was signiﬁcantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) than in the inoculum . 
The numbers of bacteria in the tonsils , lungs and contents of ileum and cecum were very low , impairing a meaningful quantitative comparison between both strains . 
The average log values of the ratio WTnal / SsrA/Bkan/nal for all samples are summarized in Fig. 1 .

The ssrA/B deletion mutant is attenuated after intravenous inoculation of piglets 
4. Discussion
In this report we characterized an ssrA/B deletion mutant in a porcine ﬁeld strain of Salmonella Typhimurium . 
The deletion was conﬁrmed , both at the transcriptional level and the phenotypic level , using qRT-PCR , a RAW replication model and a BALB/c mouse model . 
Recently it has been found that the expression of SPI-2 encoded genes is regulated exclusively through the induction of the SsrA/B regulatory system ( Löber et al. , 2006 ) . 
This means that disabling the SsrA/B system undeniably results in the loss of the SPI-2 T3SS . 
Nevertheless , it can not be ruled out that the SsrA/B system also regulates genes which are not associated to SPI-2 . 
Using qRT-PCR , it was conﬁrmed that the expression of the SPI-2 secreted effector gene sifB was abolished in the ssrA/B mutant strain . 
The overall virulence and , speciﬁcally , the expression of SPI-1 were checked in different assays , conﬁrming that the attenuation in mice is linked to the deletion of ssrA/B . 
Even though we are aware that these phenomena were described before , we strongly believe that these experiments were necessary as a positive control for our ssrA/B mutant strain , since it was made in a porcine ﬁeld strain that has not been used before in pathogenesis studies in mice . 
Using GFP-expressing bacteria , it was shown that the ssrA/B mutant strain was slightly attenuated in intracellular replication in PAM . 
This defect was more subtle compared to the defect that was observed in mouse macrophages . 
However , it can not be ruled out that the difference observed in this assay , may also be attributed to the nature of the cells used ( primary cells vs. cell line ) . 
In the ﬁrst part of this pathogenesis study , we chose to perform a single in vivo assay that resembled the natural infection , which is often established with low or moderate numbers of Salmonella ( Loynachan and Harris , 2005 ) , to be able to investigate the biological relevance of SsrA/B in the course of infection in the ﬁeld . 
The fact that very few differences were seen in the long-term intestinal colonization of pigs orally inoculated with an ssrA/B mutant strain and its isogenic parental wild type strain may come as a surprise . 
However , a closer look at pathogenesis studies performed in various host species may shed a clearer light on this matter . 
In laboratory mice , SsrA / B-regulated genes have an important impact on the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhimurium infections , particularly on the systemic phase of the infection ( Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Hensel et al. , 1998 ) , but also on the enteric phase ( Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ) . 
Data obtained in food-producing animals , however , are scarce . 
The role of SsrA/B-regulated genes in host-restricted/adapted serotypes seems consistent in the literature : they are important virulence factors for systemic disease and as a consequence for colonization of the host . 
For example , for Salmonella Gallinarum and Salmonella Pullorum , which cause severe systemic disease in fowl , SPI-2 is a prerequisite for virulence and colonization in chickens ( Jones et al. , 2001 ; Wigley et al. , 2002 ) . 
In mice and calves , SPI-2 genes are required for virulence in Salmonella Choleraesuis ( Dunyak et al. , 1997 ) and Salmonella Dublin ( Bispham et al. , 2001 ) infections , respectively . 
In broad host range serotypes , however , like Salmo-nella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium ( except in NRAMP mice ) , the importance of SPI-2 is less / described . 
In calves , a Salmonella Typhimurium SPI-2 mutant strain was attenuated in colonization after oral inoculation in a signature-tagged mutagenesis assay ( Coombes et al. , 2005 ) , but was still able to cause lethal infections ( Tsolis et al. , 1999 ) . 
SPI-2 was found to play a role in the colonization of Salmonella

Recovery of bacteria from various organs of piglets at days 1 and 3 after intravenous inoculation with an equal mixture of WTnal and SsrA/Bkan/nal . 
The log value of the ratio of the number of CFU/g sample of WTnal and SsrA/Bkan/nal is given as the mean S.D. . 
An asterisk indicates that the output ratio was signiﬁcantly different ( P < 0.05 ) from that present in the inoculum 
Typhimurium in calves , but not in chickens ( Morgan et al. , 2004 ) . 
In addition , a screening of 7680 Salmonella Enteritidis mutants for attenuation in a chicken macrophage infection model resulted in the detection of mutations in several ﬂagellar , LPS and SPI-1 associated genes , but not in SPI-2 genes ( Zhao et al. , 2002 ) . 
Only recently , it has been shown that an ssrA mutant strain promotes reproductive tract colonization , but is not essential for intestinal colonization of chickens with Salmonella Enteritidis ( Bohez et al. , 2008 ) . 
In a rabbit ileal loop model and in calves , Salmonella Typhimurium SPI-2 mutant strains-induced inﬂammation and ﬂuid accumulation to the same extent as the wild type strain ( Tsolis et al. , 1999 ; Everest et al. , 1999 ) . 
Considering these reports , the results shown here are not as surprising as expected at ﬁrst sight . 
During the preparations of this manu-script , Brumme et al. ( 2007 ) found that a SPI-2 deletion mutant was not able to induce clinical symptoms of porcine salmonellosis , whereas the SPI-2 mutant infected group showed similar quantities of salmonellas in the organs as the wild-type infected pigs . 
Almost simultaneously , Carnell et al. ( 2007 ) identiﬁed SPI-2 related genes in a signature-tagged mutagenesis assay in pigs as important for the colonization of the porcine gut . 
Even though the results of both of these assays are highly interesting and relevant in the used models , very high inoculation doses were used ( 10 -- 10 CFU per piglet ) , which do 10 11 not necessarily reﬂect the natural situation of the subclinical carriage of Salmonella Typhimurium in the ﬁeld . 
It is generally accepted that mixed inoculum assays are more capable of discriminating differences in the ability of strains to colonize the host . 
Using a mixed inoculum assay and a high inoculation dose , we could indeed show that an ssrA/B mutant strain is attenuated for the systemic colonization of internal organs of pigs after intravenous injection . 
These ﬁndings are consistent with the intramacrophagal replication defect of the ssrA/B mutant strain we observed in vitro . 
Th mixed intravenous infection protocol , however , does not ﬁt closely to the natural route of infection and bacteria may reach their host cells in a more artiﬁcial manner . 
Recently , it has been shown that the magnitude of the intracellular SPI-2 gene expression is dependent on the mechanism of internalization by macrophages ( Drektrah et al. , 2006 ) . 
This phenom-enon may additionally explain the differences that were seen in both in vivo experiments . 
In conclusion , we have shown that an ssrA/B mutant of a porcine ﬁeld strain of Salmonella Typhimurium is fully capable of colonizing the intestines of pigs and to establish a long-term intestinal persistent infection after oral inoculation . 
Using an intravenous mixed infection model , however , the ssrA/B mutant strain was defective in the systemic colonization of several internal organs . 
This work contributes to the recent insights in the serotype - and host-dependent pathogenesis of salmo-nellosis in food-producing animals .
