Received 12 August 2005/Accepted 5 October 2005 
Invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by Salmonella enterica is decreased after exposure to butyric acid . 
To understand the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon , a comparative transcriptomic analysis of Salmo-nella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in medium supplemented with butyrate was performed . 
We found that butyrate down-regulated the expression of 19 genes common to both serovars by a factor of twofold or more , and 17 of these genes localized to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) . 
These included the SPI1 regulatory genes hilD and invF . 
Of the remaining two genes , ampH has 91 % homology to an Escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein and sopE2 encodes a type III-secreted effector protein associated with invasion but located at a separate site on the chromosome from SPI1 . 
Non-host-speciﬁc Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica se-rovars , such as Salmonella serovar Enteritidis and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium , are the leading cause of self-limiting nontyphoidal gastroenteritis in humans ( 4 ) . 
The interaction between bacteria and host cells is crucial in Salmonella pathogenesis . 
During infection of the host , Salmonella bacteria encounter several environmental triggers , including the acidity of the stomach and the anoxia of the gut . 
In the intestine , the anaerobic environment is dominated by fermentative bacteria , which mainly accumulate three organic acids , acetate , propionate , and butyrate ( 6 ) . 
These acids play a vital role in maintenance of colonic integrity and metabolism . 
Butyrate is of particular importance because it has nutritious properties for the healthy and injured colon epithelium ( 16 ) and is able to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells ( 29 ) . 
In addition , a shortage of butyrate can result in intestinal inﬂammation ( 18 ) . 
Recently , butyrate was also shown to affect the interaction of Salmonella enterica with the intestinal epithelium , characterized by a reduction of invasion ( 34 , 35 ) . 
Invasion of intestinal epithelial cells is an important step in the pathogenesis of Salmonella-mediated enteritis and requires a set of genes encoded on the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) . 
Bacterial internalization occurs through the type III secretion system ( TTSS ) , which injects bacterial effector proteins directly into the cytosol of epithelial cells , inducing actin rearrangements leading to the uptake of the bacteria ( 5 , 7 ) . 
Currently , it is known that acetate , when converted to acetylphosphate , increases SPI1 gene expression through activation of the sensor kinase/response regulator system BarA / SirA ( 22 ) . 
However , the molecular mechanism underlying the invasion-suppressive activity of butyrate is unknown .

date this mechanism , we compared the gene expression pro-ﬁles of two Salmonella enterica serovars grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium versus LB medium supplemented with 10 mM butyrate by using cDNA microarray technology . 
In our experiments , we used two well-characterized strains , Salmonella serovar Typhimurium SL1344 ( 20 ) and Salmonella serovar Enteritidis 76Sa88 ( 10 ) . 
In order to determine the timing of the largest butyrate-mediated reduction in invasion , a HeLa cell invasion assay was performed . 
Brieﬂy , HeLa cells ( European Collection of Cell Cultures ) were grown in six-well plates containing HEPES-buffered Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine , 10 % fetal bo-vine serum . 
Bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium . 
The bacterial suspension was diluted 1:50 in 50 ml of either LB medium supplemented with 10 mM butyrate or control LB medium in 250-ml ﬂasks . 
The pH of all media was brought to pH 6 and the osmolarity to 600 mmol/kg . 
The suspensions were incubated statically at 37 °C . 
After 2 , 4 , and 6 h of incubation , HeLa cells were infected using a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 under 10 % CO2 atmosphere . 
Invasion was limited to 30 min , and extracellular bacteria were killed in medium containing 30 g/ml gentamicin for 30 min . 
The gentamicin concentration was subsequently reduced to 5 g/ml for the remaining time of the experiment . 
At appropriate time points , the infected cells were lysed in 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and intracellular populations determined by viable counts . 
Exposure of the bacteria to butyrate for 4 h at 37 °C resulted in the lowest invasion percentage of the HeLa cells for both serovar Typhimurium and serovar Enteritidis ( data not shown ) . 
Furthermore , to conﬁrm our ﬁndings , SPI1 expression in individual bacteria was measured in a green ﬂuorescent protein-based system using a chromosomally integrated prgH-gfp fusion ( 19 ) . 
PrgH is a structural component of the needle complex of the SPI1 type III secretion system and is regulated by HilA ( 24 ) . 
The level of prgH expression in SL1344 was measured hourly using ﬂow cytometric analysis as previously reported ( 19 ) . 
The lowest expression of prgH was observed after 4 h of incubation in media supplemented with butyrate . 
On the basis of these ﬁndings , we extracted bacterial RNA from the strains serovar Typhimurium SL1344 and serovar Enteritidis 76Sa88 after 4 h of growth in LB medium with and without butyric acid . 
The pHs of both media did not vary during the 4-h incubation . 
In order to provide robust and reproducible gene expression data , microarray experiments were performed with at least two biological and technical replicate samples for all conditions examined . 
An indirect comparison experimental design was used for the microarray hybridizations ( 36 ) . 
The reference channel was Cy3-labeled genomic DNA isolated from either serovar Typhimurium or serovar Enteritidis ( for all microarray protocols , see www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/protocols . 
html ) . 
RNA was isolated from cultures and labeled with Cy5-dCTP during reverse transcription . 
The microarray used in this study was the whole-genome Salmonella serovar Typhimurium / Enteritidis SALSA cDNA microarray which carried 5,877 coding sequences ( 13 ) . 
Features with a reference signal lower than background plus 2 standard deviations were excluded from subsequent analysis . 
The microarray data were normalized to the untreated control for each serovar and statistically ﬁltered by applying a t test with a false discovery rate of P 0.05 . 
The data were further ﬁltered to exclude genes that changed in expression by less than twofold relative to the untreated control samples . 
In serovar Typhimurium SL1344 treated with butyrate , only 49 genes were down-regulated more than two-fold . 
Interestingly , 23 of these genes were invasion-associated SPI1 genes , and 15 genes were of unknown function , among which 3 belong to the SPI1 gene cluster ( STM2868 , STM2870 , and STM2880 ) . 
Genes encoding SPI1 effector proteins were also down-regulated upon exposure to butyrate ( i.e. , STM4257 for SPI4 , pipC and sopB for SPI5 , and sopE2 ) . 
The remaining genes were iacP ( encoding an acyl carrier protein ) ; hycB , hycC , hycE , and hycG ( coding for a hydrogenase enzyme ) ; ampH ( encoding a penicillin-binding protein ) ; and hupB ( encoding a nucleoid-associated protein ) . 
The gene expression proﬁle from serovar Enteritidis 76Sa88 grown in LB containing butyrate showed a similar down-reg-ulation of SPI1 . 
Of the 90 genes that were down-regulated more than twofold , 24 were SPI1 genes and 25 had an unknown function , including the STM2880 gene located within SPI1 . 
The comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that 19 genes were down-regulated by butyrate in both strains ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Of these genes , 17 were SPI1 associated , and a description of their functions can be found in Table 1 . 
The key regulator of SPI1 is HilA , a member of the OmpR

ToxR family of transcriptional activators ( 2 ) . 
It has been shown that a null mutation in hilA causes a dramatic attenuation of invasion , demonstrating the importance of HilA for entry into epithelial cells ( 14 , 27 ) . 
As HilA is crucial for invasion , its regulation has been intensively studied . 
The complex and coordinated mechanism of hilA expression is regulated by environmental and regulatory factors . 
Invasion is tightly orchestrated by several environmental signals and shows a signiﬁcant decrease under conditions of high oxygen , low pH , and low osmolarity ( 3 , 17 ) . 
Numerous regulators of hilA , both activators and repressors , have been identiﬁed . 
BarA/SirA ( 1 ) , HilD ( 14 , 30 ) , HilC/SirC/SprA ( 11 , 12 , 28 , 30 ) , CsrAB ( 1 ) , PhoB , FadD , and FliZ ( 25 ) have been shown to activate hilA expression . 
The negative regulators , identiﬁed through transposon mutagenesis , include HilE , Ams , and Pag , whereas Hha , a small nucleoid-associated protein , was identiﬁed by introduction of a serovar Typhimurium chromosomal DNA gene bank into a serovar Typhimurium hilA : Tn5lacZY reporter strain ( 14 , 15 ) . 
Of the small nucleoid-binding proteins that affect hilA expression , H-NS acts as a repressor , but Fis and HU activate hilA by changing the expression of hilD ( 32 ) . 
Apart from hilD , none of these regulators were down-regu-lated by butyrate in both serovars . 
However , hilA expression was down-regulated sixfold in serovar Enteritidis but changed by less than twofold in serovar Typhimurium . 
In order to check the speciﬁcity of this change for serovar Enteritidis , we monitored the expression of plasmid-borne hilA : : luxCDABE and hilD : : luxCDABE transcriptional fusions both in serovar Typhi-murium SL1344 and in serovar Enteritidis 76Sa88 ( 33 ) . 
Our results are illustrated in Fig. 1B . 
These experiments conﬁrmed that the addition of butyrate to both serovar Typhimurium and serovar Enteritidis grown in LB as described above resulted in down-regulation of hilA and hilD . 
Two members of the AraC/XylS family of transcription activators , HilC and HilD , can independently derepress hilA expression by binding directly to the upstream repressing sequence and counteracting its repressing effect in vitro and in vivo ( 24 , 30 , 31 ) . 
A cascade of transcriptional activation has been unraveled in which HilD , in response to particular environmental signals , directly affects hilA expression by binding to the upstream repressing sequence , thereby derepressing hilA . 
By binding upstream of invF and prgH , HilA directly activates the invF and prgH operons . 
InvF , in conjunction with SicA and PrgH , activates the sip genes encoding the TTSS effector proteins ( 8 , 9 , 11 , 21 , 23 , 24 ) . 
Studies suggested that HilC is not required to affect the HilA activity by any environmental conditions or inputs , except by the EnvZ/OmpR regulatory pathway ( 26 ) . 
In contrast , all of the other environmental and regulatory inputs modulate hilA expression through transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional alteration of HilD or by modulating the activity of an unknown repressor ( 26 ) . 
Remarkably , we observed that most genes that showed signiﬁcant changes after contact of both Salmonella strains with butyrate were genes of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 . 
Thus , butyric acid speciﬁcally down-regulates SPI1 genes in both serovars . 
Our ﬁndings are consistent with the butyratemediated reduction in invasion reported previously ( 22 , 34 ) . 
The primary target of butyrate in the bacterial cell remains unknown , but our data suggest that butyrate could interfere with HilA-dependent regulation of SPI1 by altering the regulation of hilD transcription . 
We show that butyrate targets a narrow and speciﬁc set of genes in Salmonella . 
This underlines the importance of butyrate as a signaling molecule in the intestine playing a crucial role in the maintenance of gut health . 
Since butyrate is a fermentation product of the intestinal ﬂora , it is tempting to speculate that modiﬁcation of gut ﬂora to produce more bu tyric acid ( e.g. , by probiotics ) could reduce invasive infections by Salmonella serovars in farm animals .
