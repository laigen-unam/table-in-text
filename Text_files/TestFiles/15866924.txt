Received 15 December 2004/Accepted 8 February 2005 
In response to the in vivo environment , the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is modiﬁed . 
These modiﬁcations are controlled in part by the two-component regulatory system PmrA-PmrB , with the addition of 4-aminoarabinose ( Ara4N ) to the lipid A and phosphoethanolamine ( pEtN ) to the lipid A and core . 
Here we demonstrate that the PmrA-regulated STM4118 ( cptA ) gene is necessary for the addition of pEtN to the LPS core . 
pmrC , a PmrA-regulated gene necessary for the addition of pEtN to lipid A , did not affect core pEtN addition . 
Although imparting a similar surface charge modiﬁcation as Ara4N , which greatly affects polymyxin B resistance and murine virulence , neither pmrC nor cptA plays a dramatic role in antimicrobial peptide resistance in vitro or virulence in the mouse model . 
Therefore , factors other than surface charge/electrostatic interaction contribute to resistance to antimicrobial peptides such as polymyxin B. 
In order to survive in the mammalian host , salmonellae have evolved means of evading killing by antimicrobial peptides ( AP ) , central components of innate immunity . 
Such mechanisms have been demonstrated to be important for survival within hosts and host cells ( 9 , 16 , 27 , 28 ) . 
A common mode of increasing AP resistance involves alteration of the bacterial surface . 
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , the two-component regulatory systems ( TCRS ) PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB have been characterized as contributing to resistance to AP by mediating alterations to the outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( reviewed in reference 8 ) . 
Both TCRS respond to speciﬁc cues from the host environment and have been shown to be activated within host cell vacuoles ( 1 , 17 ) . 
PhoP-PhoQ can be activated under conditions of low magnesium or low pH in vitro ( 3 ) and can activate PmrA-PmrB via induction of PmrD , whose product affects the phosphorylation state of PmrA ( 15 , 19-21 ) . 
PmrA can also be activated independent of PhoP in response to mild acid pH or high iron concentrations ( 11 , 30 ) . 
Such activation results in the induced transcription of pmrE and pmrHFIJKLM ( also called pbg and arn elsewhere [ 12 , 35 ] ) , which encode enzymes involved in biosynthesis of aminoarabinose ( Ara4N ) and its addition primarily to the 4 - phosphate of the lipid A portion of LPS ( 14 ) . 
PmrA is also predicted to control modiﬁcation of LPS with phosphoethanolamine ( pEtN ) , because PmrA mutants with increased polymyxin B ( PM ) resistance show enhanced pEtN substitutions to the lipid A and core oligosaccharide ( OS )

fractions of LPS ( 18 ) . 
Recently , the PmrA-regulated pmrC gene product was shown to mediate the addition of pEtN to the 1-position of lipid A and affect resistance to PM ( 22 ) . 
In Neisseria meningitidis , loci necessary for transferring pEtN to the heptose II ( HepII ) of the LPS core or to lipid A were also recently identiﬁed ( 5 , 23 , 38 ) . 
Inactivation of N. meningitidis lpt-3 resulted in the absence of pEtN from HepII of the core and bestowed increased resistance to bactericidal killing and decreased opsonophagocytosis by LPS-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody B5 ( 23 ) . 
Similarly , inactivation of lptA led to loss of pEtN replacement of lipid A phosphates ( 5 ) , and lpt6 was required for the addition of pEtN-6 on HepII of the core . 
However , it is not known if these pEtN phosphotransferases play a role in neisserial AP resistance or animal virulence . 
We recently identiﬁed a number of new Salmonella PmrA-regulated genes , including one locus with homology to both lpt-3 and lptA of N. meningitidis ( 34 ) . 
In this work , we describe the further characterization of this gene , its role in pEtN modiﬁcation of LPS , and the role of pEtN modiﬁcation of LPS in AP resistance and virulence of Salmonella . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1 . 
Salmonellae were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C with aeration . 
Antibiotics were used , when appropriate , at the following concentrations : chloramphenicol , 25 g/ml ; kanamycin , 45 g/ml ; tetracycline , 25 g / ml . 
Generation of mutations in Salmonella homologues to lpt-3 of N. meningitidis . 
Initially , mutations were generated in PmrAc ( JSG435 , pmrA505 zjd : : Tn10dcam ) and PmrA-null ( pmrA : : Tn10d-tet ) backgrounds using the lambda Red recombinase and FLP-mediated recombination techniques developed by Datsenko and Wanner ( 6 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the kanamycin resistance fragment was ampliﬁed from pKD4 using primers ﬂanked with homology to pmrC , STM4118 , STM3635 , or STM0834 ( Table 2 ) . 
PCR fragments were transformed into PmrAc and PmrA-null target strains in which lambda Red recombinase had been induced from pKD46 . 
Correct integration of the kanamycin resistance gene insertion was veriﬁed by PCR . 
All strains and plasmids described herein are listed in Table 1 . 
339 
The insertion was eliminated using pCP20 as described previously , leaving a nonpolar deletion of the target gene and reintroducing a ribosome binding site ( 6 ) . 
Transcriptional fusions ( lacZ ) were generated to each gene in both the PmrAc and PmrA-null backgrounds by using site-speciﬁc recombination between the FLP-recognition target `` scar site '' generated in the deletion strains and that in pCE36 ( 7 ) . 
Mutations in STM4118 , STM3635 , STM0834 , and pmrC were also introduced into a wild-type 14028s ( JSG224 ) background using P22 phage-mediated transduction , generating JSG1960 , JSG2284 , JSG2285 , and JSG2286 . 
pmrF double mutants in selected backgrounds were generated by transducing

Tetracycline - , chloramphenicolresistant colonies were selected and designated JSG2339 to -2342 . 
AP resistance assays . 
MIC assays were performed as described elsewhere ( 32 ) . 
AP survival assays were performed by diluting logarithmic-phase bacteria to 5 10 CFU/ml followed by the addition of an AP at a set concentration . 
At various times after the addition of the AP ( as well as prior to the addition of AP ) , aliquots of the bacteria were washed , diluted , and plated onto solid medium to enumerate the surviving bacteria . 
Virulence assays . 
Survival assays were performed as described previously ( 16 ) . 
Wild-type 14028s , JSG1960 ( 14028s STM4118 : : kan ) , JSG2285 ( 14028s pmrC : : kan ) , and JSG2449 ( 14028s STM4118 : : kan pmrC : : cat ) were included in the assay . 
Brieﬂy , each strain was grown to stationary phase ( 16 h ) at 37 °C . 
Approximately 5 106 stationary-phase bacteria ( 1 log unit above the 50 % lethal dose ) were washed and resuspended in 20 to 200 l of phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7.4 . 
Female BALB/c mice ( weighing 16 to 18 g ) were inoculated orally using the swallowing reﬂex or with a feeding needle . 
Five mice were used per strain . 
Dilutions of the stationary-phase cultures were plated to enumerate bacteria present in the inocula . 
Infected mice were observed for 21 days postinoculation . 
For competition assays , wild-type ( JSG1311 ) and mutant ( JSG2449 ) bacteria were inoculated into ﬁve BALB/c mice at a 1:1 ratio ( 1 106 of each in 200 l total ) and , at 4 days postinoculation , organs were harvested , macerated , and plated onto appropriate solid media to select for each of the competing strains . 
LPS and lipid A isolation and gel analysis . 
LPS was puriﬁed from stationary-phase cells using the hot phenol-water method as previously described ( 2 ) . 
Deoxycholine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( DOC-PAGE ) was performed with an 18 % polyacrylamide gel . 
The LPS samples were dissolved at a concentration of 4 g / l , and 1 l was loaded in each well . 
The samples were electro-phoresed at 30 mA constant current mode and were developed by silver staining ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Size exclusion chromatography . 
For the LPS samples , chromatography was performed with a Sephacryl S-200 ( HR ) column ( 120 cm by 1 cm ) . 
The samples were eluted with Tris-EDTA buffer ( pH 9.2 ) , and the eluted fractions were monitored by an on-line refractive index detector and assayed by DOC-PAGE . 
Samples were pooled according to the molecular size , dialyzed extensively to remove the DOC , and lyophilized . 
This fractionated LPS was used for further analysis . 
Isolation and puriﬁcation of the oligosaccharide . 
The LPS samples were delipidated with 1 % acetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h . 
The lipid precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min . 
The supernatant was fractionated with a Bio-Gel P10 column , using water as eluent . 
There was a single major fraction of each oligosaccharide that was lyophilized and used for further analysis . 
NMR analysis . 
Proton-nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) of each oligosaccharide ( 2 mg ) was performed after exchanging three times with 99.8 % D2O ( Aldrich ) and dissolving in 0.5 ml D2O ( 100 % ) ( Cambridge Isotopes ) . 
All of the NMR experiments were accomplished with a 600-MHz Varian-Inova instrument at 30 °C . 
Two-dimensional NMR ( 2D-NMR ) was performed using standard parameters as provided by Varian . 
The gCOSY ( gradient sensitive 1H-1H correla tion spectroscopy ) spectra were measured over a spectral width of 2.5 kHz using a data set of ( t1 t2 ) of 256 by 2,048 points , and 16 scans were acquired . 
For g-HSQC ( gradient-sensitive 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy ) , the spectral widths in proton and carbon dimensions were selected to be 2.5 and 13.9 kHz , respectively , and 96 scans were acquired . 
MALDI mass spectrometry . 
The oligosaccharide samples were dissolved in Milli-Q water at a concentration of 1 g / l and mixed with 2,5-dihydroxy azo-benzoic acid matrix at a 1:1 ratio . 
The samples were spotted on a 100-well stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI ) plate and air dried . 
A 337-nm N2 laser was used to desorb the molecules , and spectra were collected in delayed , linear , and negative mode using an acceleration voltage of 20,000 .

RESULTS
Identiﬁcation of Salmonella homologues to N. meningitidis phosphoethanolamine phosphotransferases and their regulation by PmrA . 
The predicted protein sequences of lpt-3 ( NMB2010 ) , lptA ( NMB1638 ) , and lpt6 ( NMA0408 ) were compared to the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT-2 genome sequence using the NCBI database ( BLASTX and BLASTP ) . 
Similar searches and results that were restricted to the use of lpt-3 have been previously reported ( 22 ) . 
The products of four S. enterica serovar Typhimurium loci showed signiﬁcant similarity ( E value 4e 7 ) to Lpt-3 : STM3635 ( yhjW ; 24 % identity , 41 % similarity ) , STM4293 ( pmrC yjdB ; 24 % identity , 43 % similarity ) , STM4118 ( yijP ; 23 % identity , 38 % similarity ) , and STM0834 ( ybiP ; 23 % identity , 41 % similarity ) . 
LptA showed similar levels of identity and similarity to the same S. enterica serovar Typhimurium loci but demonstrated a greater degree of conservation to STM4293 ( 43 % identity , 62 % similarity ) . 
Lpt6 showed no signiﬁcant similarity to Salmonella proteins . 
STM3635 is predicted to encode a membrane-associated , met-al-dependent hydrolase . 
STM4118 , pmrC , and STM0834 encode putative integral membrane proteins , consistent with the predicted location of an LPS phosphoethanolamine phosphotransferase , and PmrC has been demonstrated to be necessary for the transfer of pEtN to the 1-phosphate of lipid A ( 22 ) . 
Two of these loci , pmrC and yijP ( STM4118 , hereafter called cptA ) , have been previously shown to be regulated by PmrA ( 15 , 31 , 34 ) , while the role of PmrA-PmrB in the regulation of STM0834 and STM3635 was unknown . 
Therefore , to determine whether PmrA activated transcription of these genes , expression of lacZ transcriptional fusions to STM3635 and STM0834 in PmrAc and PmrA-null backgrounds was compared . 
This analysis demonstrated that neither STM0834 nor STM3635 was regulated by PmrA ( data not shown ) . 
Because the transferase that catalyzes addition of pEtN to the Salmo-nella LPS core is predicted to be regulated by PmrA ( 18 , 40 ) , STM0834 and STM3635 were not further characterized . 
Structural analysis of LPS demonstrates that cptA , but not pmrC , is required for pEtN addition to the LPS core . 
To further examine the role of pmrC and cptA in LPS modiﬁcation , deletions in each gene were created in a JSG435 ( PmrAconstitutive , PmrAc ) background . 
The PmrAc strain possesses high-level PM resistance and high levels of Ara4N - and pEtNmodiﬁed LPS ( 18 ) . 
Following the isolation of LPS from these mutants , the DOC-PAGE proﬁle showed the characteristic ladder pattern , indicating molecular heterogeneity in the LPS . 
No obvious differences were detected in the patterns of the LPS between the cptA and pmrC mutants , or in comparison to the controls ( PmrA-null or PmrAc ) . 
After separation by size exclusion chromatography , LPS fractions were identiﬁed that were enriched in LPS molecules bearing a low number of O-antigenic repeats ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Compositional analysis showed that higher-molecular-weight material contained more mannose and rhamnose sugars compared to the low-molecular-weight materials ( data not shown ) . 
Appropriate low-molecu-lar-weight fractions were chosen , and the OS was prepared from the core-enriched LPS molecule by mild acid hydrolysis . 
The NMR data indicated a mixture of molecules , as expected from LPS heterogeneity . 
The anomeric region indicated that most of the sugars are - linked and lie between 5.8 and 4.8 ppm ; however , there was one - linked sugar at 4.5 ppm , as was evident from 2D-NMR spectroscopy . 
The other reporting group signals were 6-deoxy methyl doublets from rhamnose at 1.0 to 1.35 ppm and N-acetyl methyl singlets at 2.1 ppm . 
The H-3 methylene protons of the Kdo residue resonate at 1.9 and 2.2 ppm . 
The other nonanomeric signals from ring protons overlap between 4.4 and 3.5 ppm . 
For the controls , the characteristic chemical shift for the distal methylene ( - CH2 - ) protons from the phosphorylated ethanolamine group ( pEtN / PEA ) was found in both JSG435 ( PmrAc ) and also in JSG421 ( PmrA-null ) at 3.3 ppm , which was evident from the NMR spectra ( Fig. 2 ) . 
However , the ratio of the integral area for the methylene to anomeric proton at 5.21 ppm was 2:1 for JSG43 and 1.5:1 for JSG421 , indicating that the latter strain contained less pEtN . 
2D-NMR further conﬁrmed the presence of the pEtN group on both OS preparations from JSG435 and JSG421 in that there was a distinct COSY correlation between the distal and proximal - CH2 - protons at 3.3 and 4.2 ppm , respectively ( data not shown ) . 
Further , the presence of pEtN was conﬁrmed by C-H one-bond heteronuclear g-HSQC analysis , which showed that the distal - CH2 protons at 3.3 ppm were correlated to the nitrogen-bearing carbon of the pEtN group , which resonated at 40.0 ppm ( data not shown ) . 
MALDI was also performed on the controls . 
The MALDI mass spectrum showed the presence of more than one molecular species . 
The 123 mass unit difference between m/z at 2426 and 2549 in the JSG435 OS indicates the presence of pEtN in this mutant ( Fig. 3 ) . 
There also was a molecular distribution of oligosaccharides with a larger number of repeating units ( OS1 ) that have the pEtN-bearing oligosaccharide . 
We also observed similar ions in JSG421 samples , with a 123 mass difference indicating the presence of pEtN distribution on that oligosaccharide ( Fig. 3 ) . 
However , again , the intensity of pEtN-bearing signals was less in the JSG421 OS than in JSG435 OS . 
Examination of JSG1863 ( PmrAc cptA ) and JSG2273 ( PmrAc pmrC ) by NMR and MALDI was also performed . 
As with the controls , the distal ( with respect to phosphate ) meth-ylene protons ( - CH2 - ) of the pEtN group had a characteristic chemical shift near 3.3 ppm . 
The 1D-1H-NMR of the OS isolated from JSG1863 and JSG2273 showed the presence of the distal - CH2 signal of pEtN at 3.3 ppm in the latter , while it was completely absent on the former ( Fig. 2 ) . 
2D-NMR further detected the presence of the pEtN group on the OS from JSG2273 , where there is a distinct COSY correlation between the distal and proximal - CH2 - at 3.3 and 4.2 ppm , respectively . 
The presence of the pEtN signal was conﬁrmed by the C-H one-bond heteronuclear g-HSQC spectrum , where the distal - CH2 protons at 3.3 ppm correlated with a nitrogen-bearing carbon of the pEtN group that resonated at 40.0 ppm ( data not shown ) . 
In the MALDI mass spectrum , the presence of the pEtN signal in JSG2273 was observed ( the 123 mass unit difference at m/z at 2417.3 and 2540.3 in the JSG2273 OS ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
However , there was no indication of 123 mass differences in the JSG1863 mutant , demonstrating the lack of pEtN in the core of this mutant . 
Other minor differences were noted between JSG1863 and controls , but they did not correlate with pEtN modiﬁcation . 
Therefore , the core of the LPS in JSG2273 ( PmrAc pmrC ) still possesses pEtN , whereas the LPS core of JSG1863 ( PmrAc cptA ) does not . 
pmrC and cptA have a modest effect on resistance to PM . 
Strains with various combinations of deletions in pmrC and cptA ( in a PmrAc background ; JSG1863 and JSG2273 ) were tested for increased susceptibility to PM using standard MIC assays . 
Strains JSG1863 and JSG2273 each showed a twofold decrease in PM resistance ( 4 g/ml PM ) compared to the parent PmrAc strain ( 8 g/ml PM ) . 
Because the loss of Ara4N has been shown to have a dramatic effect on PM resistance in S. enterica serotypes , mutants containing deﬁned pmrHFIJKLM operon insertions , or those deﬁcient in this operon plus either pmrC or cptA , were examined in MIC assays . 
Such double mutants were shown to be no more susceptible to PM than mutation of pmrF alone ( 0.03 g/ml PM ) . 
While these data suggested that elimination of pEtN phosphotransferase genes does not amplify PM susceptibility beyond that conferred by abolishing Ara4N modiﬁcation of lipid A , this analysis was furthered with additional PM sensitivity assays . 
Survival assays using 0.5 g/ml polymyxin B and strains containing pmrC , cptA , or pmrC cptA double mutations in a PmrAc background were performed . 
As shown in Fig. 4A , these mutants possessed no statistically signiﬁcant differences in their levels of survival in comparison to the PmrAc parental strain , further demonstrating that pEtN modiﬁcation of LPS plays a modest role in regard to PM resistance . 
When these mutations ( pmrC , cptA , or pmrC cptA ) were examined in a PmrAc pmrF : : Tn10d background , both cptA and pmrC resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in survival compared to the PmrAc pmrF : : Tn10d strain ( Fig. 4B ) . 
However , while the cptA mutation resulted in a 2-fold drop in survival , the PmrAc pmrF : : Tn10d pmrC strain ( as well as the PmrAc pmrF : : Tn10d pmrC cptA strain ) demonstrated a 94-fold drop in survival , which obtained a level similar to the survival of a PmrA-null strain . 
Thus , cptA appears to play a minor role in PM resistance , which can be primarily observed in the absence of Ara4N modiﬁcation of lipid A . 
The pmrC gene appears to play a larger role in PM resistance , but it also primarily plays a role only in the absence of Ara4N lipid A modiﬁcation . 
Strains lacking both cptA and pmrC , but not those lacking either gene alone , show a modest virulence defect in the mouse model of typhoid fever . 
Because the loss of pEtN plays a modest role in resistance to AP and AP resistance has been shown to play a role in virulence , pEtN mutants were examined for virulence defects in the mouse model . 
Mice infected by the intraperitoneal or oral routes with strains containing cptA , pmrC , or cptA pmrC double deletions in a wild-type background showed no differences in the 50 % lethal dose compared to controls ( data not shown ) . 
To further examine the in vivo relevance of pEtN LPS modiﬁcation on virulence , competition infection experiments were performed . 
While single mutations in cptA or pmrC had no defect in competition experiments when evaluated against the wild-type strain ( data not shown ) , a cptA pmrC double mutant showed a consistent , but less than 10-fold decrease in survival in all tissues examined ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Therefore , the inability to modify LPS in vivo with pEtN on both core and lipid A regions can be shown to play a minor role in virulence . 
FIG. 1 . 
DOC-PAGE analysis of LPS fractions . 
Sephacryl S-200 fractions of whole LPS from strains JSG1863 and JSG2273 were collected and electrophoresed . 
Four lanes corresponding to different fractions are shown for each strain ( lanes 1 to 4 , JSG1863 ; lanes 5 to 8 , JSG2273 ) . 
Similar proﬁles of strains JSG421 and JSG435 were performed but are not shown . 
Asterisks mark the lanes with the polysaccharide chosen for further analysis . 
FIG. 2 . 
Proton NMR spectra of LPS core-enriched polysaccharide preparations . 
The proton signals are as indicated in the ﬁgure . 
Strain JSG1863 ( PmrAc cptA ) is missing the signal at 3.3 ppm corresponding to the chemical shift for the distal methylene ( - CH2 - ) protons of the pEtN ( also called - PEA ) . 
All other samples , including that of JSG2273 ( PmrAc pmrC ) and JSG421 ( pmrA : : Tn10d-tet ) , still possess a signal at 3.3 ppm ( although the signal is less intense in JSG421 ) . 
The signals at about 2.9 ppm ( marked with an asterisk ) are due to an unidentiﬁed contaminant 
DISCUSSION
The expression of mechanisms for resistance to AP is an important determinant of pathogenicity , and susceptibility of bacteria to AP is associated with attenuation of virulence ( 9 , 10 , 13 , 28 ) . 
The TCRS PmrA-PmrB of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has been shown to be activated within host cell vacuoles ( 1 , 17 ) and has been characterized as contributing to AP resistance by mediating alterations to the outer membrane and LPS ( reviewed in reference 8 ) . 
PmrA controls the expression of pmrE and pmrHFIJKLM , which encode enzymes involved in producing Ara4N substitutions on lipid A ( 16 ) . 
In addition , PM-sensitive strains have been reported to lack the ability to produce pEtN substitutions in the lipid A and core oligosaccharide fractions of LPS ( 18 , 40 ) . 
Four Salmonella open reading frames ( STM3635 , STM4293 [ pmrC ] , STM4118 [ cptA ] , and STM0834 ) were shown to pos sess signiﬁcant similarity to the N. meningitidis genes ( lpt-3 and lptA ) that encode pEtN phosphotransferases ( 5 , 23 ) . 
Two of these genes , STM4293 ( pmrC ) and STM4118 ( cptA ) , were previously shown to be PmrA regulated ( 34 ) . 
STM3635 and STM0834 are not PmrA regulated and their function remains unknown , although by homology they appear to be phosphoethanolamine phosphotransferases . 
pmrC , the ﬁrst open reading frame in the pmrCAB operon , has been shown to be necessary for the transfer of pEtN to lipid A ( 22 ) . 
However , it was not shown in this work whether PmrC could add pEtN to other positions in the LPS , such as the core . 
We hypothesized that 
PmrC may be a phosphoethanolamine phosphotransferase speciﬁc for lipid A and cptA may encode a phosphoethanol-amine phosphotransferase speciﬁc for the LPS core . 
NMR and mass spectrometry of PmrAc pmrC and PmrAc cptA mutants demonstrated that cptA but not pmrC is necessary for adding pEtN to the LPS core . 
Therefore , there exist distinct PmrA-regulated phosphoethanolamine phosphotransferases of the LPS core and lipid A ( as it is likely that CptA does not add pEtN to lipid A ) . 
It is highly probable that the pEtN group observed in this work is that added to heptose I of the core . 
A second PmrA-regulated modiﬁcation of the inne core Kdo with pEtN has been reported ( 18 ) but not conﬁrmed . 
Such a modiﬁcation could not have been observed in our NMR or mass spectroscopy studies due to the biochemical processing of the oligosaccharide prior to analysis , but it will be the subject of future studies with additional PmrA-regulated gene mutants . 
Also of interest in these biophysical studies was the identiﬁcation of pEtN in the LPS core of the PmrA-null strain . 
This was surprising , because PmrA regulates the expression of cptA , which has a clear pEtN-deﬁcient phenotype . 
This may suggest that core pEtN modiﬁcation and/or cptA expression is not completely dependent upon PmrA . 
Increased substitution of lipid A with Ara4N results in increased resistance to AP , including PM , neutrophil granule AP azurocidin ( CAP-37 ) , and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein ( CAP-57 ) ( 18 , 29 , 33 , 36 ) . 
It is surmised that substitution of the anionic phosphates of LPS with moieties such as Ara4N reduces the electrostatic attraction and binding between the LPS and cationic AP . 
LPS from PM-resistant Sal-monella binds PM poorly in vitro ( 37 ) . 
Because pEtN addition to lipid A and core phosphate moieties would also result in decreased anionic charge of the LPS , it was expected that pEtN modiﬁcation of LPS should play a similar role in AP resistance . 
This reasoning is also in part due to the results of Yethon et al. , which demonstrated that the loss of waaP , which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the HepI of the Salmonella LPS core and is required for further pEtN modiﬁcation of this Hep residue , affected both PM resistance and virulence ( 39 ) . 
Here , we show that the lack of PmrC or CptA activity reduced the MIC of PM 2-fold , whereas elimination of Ara4N modiﬁcation reduced resistance to PM 100-fold ( 14 , 16 ) . 
Similar major effects of Ara4N and minor effects of pEtN were observed in PM survival assays . 
Therefore , while both modiﬁcations decrease the anionic charge of LPS , only Ara4N substitution dramatically affects the ability of PM to associate with LPS . 
These results suggest that LPS charge is only partially responsible for interactions between PM and LPS and that the structure and/or location of the Ara4N modiﬁcation to lipid A has an inhibitory effect on PM binding . 
With respect to pmrC , these results are somewhat contradictory to the results of Lee et al. ( 22 ) . 
In that work , a strain with a mutation in pmrC had a signiﬁcant effect on PM resistance but , similar to our ﬁndings , the role of pmrC-mediated LPS modiﬁcation was inferior to that of Ara4N LPS modiﬁcation with regard to PM resistance . 
As a possible explanation of these contradictory results , variations in experimental conditions may have led to differential pmrC expression and/or PM killing that inﬂuenced in vitro bacterial survival . 
The PmrA-PmrB TCRS , and also the dependent AP resistance , has been demonstrated to affect virulence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in the mammalian host ( 16 ) . 
A null mutation in pmrA , pmrE , or pmrHFIJKLM decreases AP resistance and results in 10 - to 1,000-fold decreased survival of the bacteria in the murine model of infection ( 16 ) . 
Therefore , it was of interest to determine whether the PmrA-mediated pEtN substitution of core and lipid A contributed to AP resistance and/or survival in the host . 
Mutation of pmrC or cptA did not result in decreased virulence as individual mutations but , when combined , resulted in a consistent but less than 10-fold decrease in the competitive index compared to a wild-type strain . 
This decrease in competitive index was even observed in the intestinal lumen , an early point after infection . 
This may suggest that antimicrobial factors in the lumen ( possibly including AP ) substantially contribute to the observed reduction in the competitive index . 
However , the decreased AP resistance evinced by loss of pEtN modiﬁcations was not sufﬁcient to be dramatically detrimental to survival of Salmonella in the murine model . 
The previously mentioned waaP mutation had a dramatic affect on virulence , which might have been due to the increased susceptibility to AP in this mutant ( 39 ) . 
However , since both this waaP and the cptA mutant are missing pEtN on the core but do not have equal virulence defects , it i likely that the virulence attenuation of the waaP mutant can be attributed to its other known membrane effects , such as an increase in outer membrane phospholipids . 
Activation of pmrC and cptA by PmrA suggests that these loci , and the consequent pEtN modiﬁcations , are up-regulated during infection of the mouse ( 17 ) , but the function of pEtN LPS modiﬁcations remain unclear . 
Evidence in N. meningitidis indicates that LOS is a receptor for complement component C4b and that substitution of core with pEtN affects binding by C4b ( 26 ) . 
Speciﬁcally , pEtN substitutions on HepII form amide bonds with C4b and augment complement-mediated killing in serum bactericidal assays . 
Bacteria with pEtN additions at position 6 of HepII were more efﬁciently eliminated than those with substitutions on position 3 , and strains with pEtN at position 3 of HepII were more likely to be found in clinical isolates ( 26 ) . 
Salmonella has been shown to add pEtN to Kdo and HepI , but not HepII ; however , pEtN substitution of the core may likewise affect complement killing in Salmo-nella . 
If so , AP resistance attributed to pEtN substitution may be negated by increased recognition and elimination by complement . 
Further studies of the effect of pEtN substitution of LPS on resistance to AP other than PM and on immune rec-ognition are required in order to understand the physiological role of pEtN modiﬁcation in vivo . 
FIG. 3 . 
The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry spectrum of LPS core-enriched polysaccharide preparations . 
As indicated in the ﬁgure , the clusters of signals are due to polysaccharides comprised of the core oligosaccharide plus one O-chain repeat unit , core plus two repeat units , etc. . 
The core ( after mild acid hydrolysis ) is deﬁned as that published by Olsthoorn et al. ( 25 ) . 
The structures corresponding to m/z 2644.6 and m/z 3245.0 , 220 mass units larger than m/z 2424.8 and m/z 3025.0 , respectively , are likely due to structures that still contain the second Kdo residue of the core oligosaccharide . 
Ion peaks at 2446.76 and 3044.34 in JSG2273 ( 2446.63 and 3045.15 in JSG1863 ) are due to sodiated ( 22 mass units ) forms of other apparent ions . 
These spectra clearly reveal the presence of structures with an added pEtN ( PEA ) component in JSG345 , JSG421 , and JSG2273 , i.e. , ions that are increased 123 mass units , as indicated in the ﬁgure . 
The lack of a 123-mass unit increase in any observed peak conﬁrms proton NMR data concerning the lack of pEtN in the LPS core of strain JSG1863 ( PmrAc cptA ) . 
FIG. 4 . 
PM resistance assays of strains deﬁcient in LPS modiﬁcations . 
Strains were incubated in the presence of 0.5 g/ml PM for 1 h at room temperature followed by plating to determine the percent survival . 
( A ) Strains with mutations in cptA , pmrC , or both genes were examined for PM sensitivity in a PmrA-constitutive ( PmrAc ) background . 
Neither mutation had a signiﬁcant effect on PM resistance in this background compared to the PmrAc parent strain ( t test or analysis of variance [ ANOVA ] , P 0.05 ) . 
( B ) Strains with mutations in cptA , pmrC , or both genes were examined for PM sensitivity in a PmrAc pmrF ( aminoarabinose-deﬁcient ) background . 
Strains containing cptA , pmrC , or both mutations in the PmrAc pmrF background demonstrated a level of sensitivity to PM that was signiﬁcantly different from the PmrAc pmrF parent strain ( t test or ANOVA , P 0.05 ) .
