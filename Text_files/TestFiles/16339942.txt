In Salmonella enterica , PhoP is the response regulator of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system that controls the expression of various virulence factors in response to external Mg2 + . 
Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of a PhoP variant with a C-terminal His tag ( PhoPHis ) enhances dimerization and binding to target DNA . 
Here , the effect of phosphorylation on the oligomerization and DNA binding properties of both wild-type PhoP ( PhoP ) and PhoPHis are compared . 
Gel ﬁltration chromatography showed that PhoP exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer regardless of its phosphorylation state . 
In contrast , 
unphosphorylated PhoPHis was mostly monomeric , whereas PhoPHis ~ P existed as a mixture of monomer and dimer . 
By monitoring the tryptophan ﬂuorescence of the proteins and the ﬂuorescence of the probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid bound to them , it was found that PhoP and PhoPHis exhibited different spectral properties . 
The interaction between PhoP or PhoPHis and the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter was monitored by surface plasmon resonance . 
Binding of PhoP to the PhoP box was barely inﬂuenced by phosphorylation . 
In contrast , phosphorylation of PhoPHis clearly increased the interaction of PhoPHis with target DNA . 
Altogether , these data show that a His tag at the C-terminus of PhoP affects its biochemical properties , most likely by affecting its conformation and/or its oligomerization state . 
More importantly , these results show that wild-type PhoP dimerization and interaction with target DNA are independent of phosphorylation , which is in contrast to the previously proposed model .

INTRODUCTION 
Two-component systems are the prevalent signal transduction pathways in bacteria . 
They mediate the adaptive response to environmental changes by modulating the expression of speciﬁc genes . 
Two-component systems are typically composed of a histidine kinase sensor and a cognate response regulator ( Stock et al. , 2000 , 1989 ) . 
Upon autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase sensor on a highly conserved histidine residue , the phosphoryl group is transferred to a speciﬁc aspartate residue of the response regulator . 
Most response regulators are transcription factors that consist of a conserved N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain . 
Transcriptional regulation of target genes is modulated through phosphorylation of the response regulator ( Stock & West , 2003 ) . 
Structural studies have shown that phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain promotes a long-range conformational change that is transmitted throughout the receiver domain ( Stock & West , 2003 ) . 
The lifetime of phosphorylated response regulators is limited by both an intrinsic autophosphatase activity of the response regulator and a phosphatase activity of the cognate kinase sensor . 
Response regulators are classiﬁed into the OmpR/PhoB , NarL/FixJ and Ntrc/DctD subfamilies based on sequence similarity within the C-terminal effector domain ( Stock et al. , 1989 ) . 
In members of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily , the C-terminal domain consists of a winged helix -- turn -- helix motif ( Kenney , 2002 ) . 
Although all members of this subfamily share a similar three-dimensional structure and are activated through phosphorylation , they appear to vary in their mechanism of activation . 
Phosphorylation of Escherichia coli PhoB has been shown to induce dimerization and , in turn , increase its afﬁnity for DNA ( Fiedler & Weiss , 1995 ; McCleary , 1996 ) . 
In contrast , phosphorylation of OmpR was found to enhance its DNA-binding afﬁnity without promoting dimerization of the protein in solution , suggesting that dimerization may occur upon DNA

interaction ( Aiba et al. , 1989 ; Jo et al. , 1986 ) . 
The PhoPBSU response regulator of the Bacillus subtilis PhoP/PhoR two-component system ( designated PhoPBSU to distinguish it from PhoP of the Salmonella enterica PhoP/PhoQ system ) has been shown to be dimeric and bind target DNA independently of its phosphorylation state ( Liu & Hulett , 1997 ; Prágai et al. , 2004 ) .

In S. enterica , PhoP is the response regulator of the PhoP / PhoQ two-component system , which responds to environmental Mg ( Garcia-Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) . 
It is another 2 + member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily . 
It modulates the expression of more than 40 genes involved in adaptation to 2 + Mg - limiting environments , survival within macrophages , LPS modiﬁcations and resistance to antimicrobial peptides ( Ernst et al. , 2001 ; Groisman , 2001 ) . 
Although some genes regulated by PhoP do not display a consensus DNA recognition sequence for PhoP , other PhoP-regulated genes , such as the mgtA gene , contain a single conserved PhoP box in their promoter region ( Lejona et al. , 2003 ) . 
This PhoP box is located approximately 30 bases upstream of the trans-cription start site and consists of a direct repeat of the heptanucleotide ( G/T ) GTTTA ( A/T ) ( Groisman et al. , 1989 ; Lejona et al. , 2003 ) . 
To date , the E. coli and S. enterica PhoP proteins that have been characterized in vitro harboured a C-terminal His tag ( PhoPHis ) ( Lejona et al. , 2003 , 2004 ; Minagawa et al. , 2003 ; Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) . 
These studies led to a model in which phosphorylation promotes PhoP dimerization and , in turn , increases PhoP binding to the PhoP box . 
In this study , we examined the effect of phosphorylation on the oligomeric state and DNA binding properties of the untagged S. enterica PhoP ( PhoP ) . 
To compare our results with previous studies , we conducted similar experiments with the PhoP variant harbouring a C-terminal His tag ( PhoPHis ) . 
Our data showed that phosphorylation of PhoP has no major effect on dimerization and DNA interaction . 
In contrast , we found that phosphorylation of PhoPHis promotes both dimerization and binding to DNA . 
METHODS
Plasmid constructions . 
E. coli strain XL1-Blue ( Stratagene ) was used for all DNA manipulations . 
Plasmid pET-PHis , which encodes the S. enterica PhoP protein fused to a C-terminal His tag ( PhoPHis ) , has been described previously ( Montagne et al. , 2001 ) . 
For the construction of plasmid pET-P , which encodes the wild-type PhoP protein , the phoP gene was PCR ampliﬁed from plasmid pET-PHis using the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) with primer PET-59 ( 59-CGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-39 ) , which hybridizes with the T7 promoter region of pET plasmids , and primer PHOP-BAMHI-39 ( 59-GCGGGATCCTTAGCGCAATTCAAAAAGA-TATCCTTGTC-39 , underlined nucleotides indicate engineered res-triction sites ) . 
PCR products were puriﬁed using a PCR puriﬁcation kit ( Qiagen ) , digested with NdeI and BamHI , and inserted into the expression vector pET-3a ( Novagen ) previously digested with the same enzymes . 
The inserts of plasmids pET-P and pET-PHis were sequenced , and the nucleotide sequences were identical to that of the S. enterica phoP gene . 
The DNA fragment corresponding to the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain ( Arg 252 -- Glu 487 ) was PCR ampliﬁed from plasmid pET-Q ( Montagne et al. , 2001 ) using primers PHOQCYTO-59 ( 59-GTCAGAATTC-CGCAACCTTAATCAACTGCTCAAAAG-39 ) and PHOQCYTO-39 ( 59-CTGACTCGAGTTATTCCTCTTTCTGTGTGGGATGC-39 ) . 
PCR products were puriﬁed , digested with EcoRI and XhoI , and inserted into plasmid pGEX-4T1 ( Amersham Biosciences ) digested with the same enzymes , to generate plasmid pGEX-Qcyto . 
Overexpression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins . 
For puriﬁcation of the PhoP protein , E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) / pLysE cells transformed with the pET-P plasmid were grown at 22 uC in Luria -- Bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mg ml ) and 21 chloramphenicol ( 30 mg ml ) . 
At OD600 0 ? 
8 , transcription of the 21 phoP gene was induced overnight with 1 mM IPTG . 
Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A ( 25 mM NaPO4 , pH 6 ? 
0 ) . 
After lysis by ultrasonic disruption , cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 216 000 g for 30 min at 4 uC . 
The supernatant was applied to a 1 ml Resource Q column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with buffer A . 
After a 15 ml wash with buffer A , proteins were eluted by applying a 0 -- 1 ? 
0 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer , at a ﬂow rate of 1 ? 
5 ml min . 
Fractions 21 enriched in PhoP were pooled and dialysed overnight against buffer B ( 25 mM NaPO4 , pH 7 ? 
0 ) . 
The dialysed proteins were then applied to a 1 ml HiTrap Heparin HP column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with buffer B . 
After a 15 ml wash with buffer B , proteins were eluted by applying a 0 -- 1 ? 
0 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer . 
The PhoPHis protein was overexpressed as described above for PhoP , and puriﬁed by Ni - NTA ( nitrilotriacetic acid ) chroma-2 + tography as described previously ( Montagne et al. , 2001 ) . 
Both puri-ﬁed PhoP and PhoPHis were dialysed overnight against buffer C ( 20 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 ? 
9 , 50 mM NaCl ) . 
Proteins were kept at 4 uC and used within 4 days . 
For puriﬁcation of the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain fused to the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) protein ( GST-PhoQcyto ) , E. coli XL1-Blue cells transformed with the pGEX-Qcyto plasmid were grown at 37 uC in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mg ml21 ) . 
At OD600 0 ? 
8 , cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above . 
The supernatant was loaded on a 1 ml GSTrap FF column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated in buffer D ( 20 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 ? 
9 , 200 mM NaCl ) . 
After extensive wash with buffer D , proteins were eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 10 mM glutathione . 
Fractions containing GST-PhoQcyto were pooled and dialysed overnight against buffer C. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce ) , using dilutions of BSA as standards . 
Phosphorylation of PhoP and PhoPHis . 
The puriﬁed PhoP or PhoPHis protein was phosphorylated with either the GST-PhoQcyto protein or E. coli membranes containing the overexpressed PhoQ-T48I protein . 
E. coli membranes enriched in the PhoQ-T48I protein were prepared as described previously ( Sanowar et al. , 2003 ) . 
Reactions were performed in the presence of 1 -- 1 ? 
5 mM ATP to maximize the efﬁciency of phosphorylation . 
For gel ﬁltration experiments , PhoP or PhoPHis ( 10 mM ) was phosphorylated with GST-PhoQcyto ( 2 mM ) in a 2 ml volume of phosphorylation buffer ( 50 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 ? 
5 , 200 mM KCl , 0 ? 
1 mM EDTA , 5 % v/v glycerol ) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 . 
Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP and incubated for 1 h at 22 uC . 
Unphosphorylated PhoP or PhoPHis was subjected to the same procedure except that H2O was substituted for ATP . 
For ﬂuorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments , PhoP or PhoPHis ( 15 mM ) was incubated for 20 min at 22 uC with E. coli membranes containing the overexpressed PhoQ-T48I protein ( approx . 
1 ? 
5 mM ) in phosphorylation buffer supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 ? 
5 mM ATP . 
Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM . 
PhoP ~ P or PhoPHis ~ P was separated from the PhoQ-containing membranes by centrifugation at 216 000 g for 10 min at 4 uC . 
Unphosphorylated PhoP proteins were subjected to the same procedure except that H2O was substituted for ATP . 
For SPR experiments , the PhoP proteins were dialysed overnight at 4 uC against SPR buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 ? 
4 , 150 mM KCl , 10 mM EDTA , 0 ? 
005 % v/v Tween 20 ) . 
The presence of EDTA in the SPR buffer prevented the autodephosphorylation of PhoP ~ P or PhoPHis ~ P. 
To assess the extent of PhoP phosphorylation , reactions were performed with 1 mM [ c - P ] ATP [ 10 Ci mmole ( 37 32 21 61010 Bq mmole ) ] and stopped by the addition of 4 21 6 Laemmli SDS sample buffer ( 250 mM Tris/HCl , pH 6 ? 
8 , 8 % SDS , 40 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 0 ? 
02 % bromophenol blue , 4 % b-mercaptoethanol ) . 
Reaction pro-ducts were heated at 37 uC for 5 min and applied to 10 % SDS-PAGE gels . 
Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The band corresponding to PhoP ~ P or PhoPHis ~ P was quantiﬁed using Quantity One software ( Bio-Rad ) . 
This value was then compared to a standard curve generated by using known concentrations of [ c - P ] ATP ( 5 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 pM ) . 
The efﬁciency 32 of the phosphorylation reaction was calculated using the ratio of 1 radiolabelled/100 000 non-radiolabelled phosphoryl groups . 
Gel ﬁltration chromatography . 
Samples ( 2 ml ) of PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis or PhoPHis ~ P ( 10 mM solution ) were indivi-dually applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel ﬁltration column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with running buffer ( 25 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 ? 
5 , 150 mM NaCl ) . 
Proteins were eluted in the same buffer at a ﬂow rate of 0 ? 
5 ml min and collected in 1 ml fractions . 
21 Protein concentration was monitored by measuring the OD280 and fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE . 
Blue dextran 2000 was used to determine the column void volume . 
A mixture of protein mole-cular mass standards , containing b-amylase ( 200 kDa ) , alcohol dehydrogenase ( 150 kDa ) , BSA ( 66 kDa ) , carbonic anhydrase ( 29 kDa ) and cytochrome C ( 12 ? 
4 kDa ) , was applied to the column under similar conditions . 
The elution volumes and molecular masses of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve from which we determined the apparent molecular mass of the various PhoP proteins . 
Fluorescence spectroscopy . 
Fluorescence spectra were obtained at 22 uC using a Varian Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectrophoto-meter . 
Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins treated with 10 mM EDTA were diluted to the desired concentration using a buffer containing 20 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 ? 
9 , 50 mM NaCl . 
Each spectrum was the mean of four consecutive scans . 
All spectra were corrected by subtracting the blank spectrum corresponding to buffer alone . 
For intrinsic ﬂuorescence , protein samples ( 4 mM ) were excited at 295 nm with a slit width of 5 nm . 
Emission spectra were collected from 300 to 450 nm with a slit width of 5 nm . 
1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid ( ANS ) , a ﬂuorescent hydro-phobic dye , was purchased from Fluka . 
For binding experiments , ANS ( 500 mM ) was incubated with the various PhoP proteins ( 1 ? 
6 mM ) in the absence or presence of 7 ? 
0 M urea for 30 min at 22 uC in the dark . 
Following incubation , spectra were recorded by exciting the samples at 372 nm , and measuring emission over the range of 400 to 600 nm using 10 nm slit widths for both excitation and emission . 
Surface plasmon resonance . 
SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore 2000 using a streptavidin sensor chip ( Biacore AB ) . 
Each surface of the chip was conditioned as recommended by the manufacturer , and equilibrated with SPR buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 ? 
4 , 150 mM KCl , 10 mM EDTA , 0 ? 
005 % v/v Tween 20 ) . 
The PhoP box of the mgtA promoter was prepared by annealing a 59-biotinylated oligonucleotide ( 59-biotin-GGGGTCTGGTTTATC-GTTGGTTTAATTGGGG-39 ; underlined nucleotides indicate the 
PhoP box ) to a non-biotinylated complementary oligonucleotide ( 59-CCCCAATTAAACCAACGATAAACCAGACCCC-39 ) . 
Equimolar amounts of both oligonucleotides were mixed , heated at 95 uC for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature . 
Similarly , a DNA duplex containing a randomized PhoP box was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide 59-biotin-GGGGTCTACGCTCTCGTTAAC-CCTATTGGGG-39 ( underlined nucleotides indicate the randomized PhoP box ) to a complementary oligonucleotide ( 59-CCCCAATAGG-GTTAACGAGAGCGTAGACCCC-39 ) . 
Biotinylated DNA duplexes were diluted to 20 nM in SPR buffer and injected at a ﬂow rate of 5 ml min until approximately 700 resonance units ( RUs ) were 21 immobilized on the chip . 
Measurements were performed at 22 uC at a ﬂow rate of 25 ml min . 
Phosphorylated and unphosphory-21 lated proteins were diluted in SPR buffer , containing 10 mM EDTA , prior to injection . 
Following two 75 ml injections of SPR buffer , PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis or PhoPHis ~ P ( 0 ? 
1 , 0 ? 
3 and 1 mM ) was injected over the sensor chip surfaces on which the DNA duplexes had been immobilized . 
Following an injection of 180 s , the kinetics of dissociation were monitored by injecting SPR buffer for 300 s . 
The sensor surfaces were regenerated by performing two 50 ml injections of 3 M NaCl ( 100 ml min ) followed by an EXTRACLEAN 21 procedure as recommended by the manufacturer . 
All measurements were performed within 24 h following phosphorylation . 
Speciﬁc binding was calculated by subtracting the sensorgrams obtained with the randomized PhoP box from the sensorgrams obtained with the mgtA PhoP box . 
RESULTS
Overexpression, puriﬁcation and phosphorylation of PhoP and PhoPHis
The PhoP protein was overexpressed in E. coli as both the wild-type protein ( PhoP ) and a C-terminally His-tagged protein ( PhoPHis ) . 
PhoP was puriﬁed to homogeneity by a two-step procedure involving anion exchange and heparin afﬁnity chromatography , whereas PhoPHis was puriﬁed by Ni - NTA afﬁnity chromatography . 
SDS-PAGE analysis 2 + showed that PhoP and PhoPHis migrated with apparent molecular masses of approximately 28 and 29 kDa , respectively , which are consistent with the calculated molecular masses of PhoP ( 25 634 Da ) and PhoPHis ( 26 700 Da ) ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Both PhoP and PhoP were phosphorylated to similar His extents by the PhoQ protein overproduced in E. coli membranes , indicating that both proteins efﬁciently catalyse the phosphoryl transfer from PhoQ to PhoP ( Fig. 1b ) . 
Puriﬁed PhoP and PhoPHis were phosphorylated in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 by using either the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain fused to the GST protein ( GSTPhoQcyto ) or E. coli membranes enriched with the PhoQ-T48I mutant , both of which possess decreased phosphatase activity ( Sanowar et al. , 2003 ) . 
PhoP and PhoPHis were phosphorylated to similar extents by GST-PhoQcyto and PhoQ-T48I ( data not shown ) . 
Under our experimental conditions , approximately 90 % of both PhoP and PhoPHis were phosphorylated ( see Methods ) , which is consistent with previous studies ( Lejona et al. , 2004 ) . 
Most response regulators possess an intrinsic autophos-2 + phatase activity that is Mg - dependent . 
The half-life of PhoPHis ~ P has been reported to be approximately 60 min 
( Castelli et al. , 2000 ) . 
To increase the stability of PhoP ~ P and PhoPHis ~ P , EDTA was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM after the phosphorylation reaction . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( c ) , the presence of EDTA prevented PhoP ~ P dephosphorylation for at least 24 h. Similar results were obtained with PhoPHis ~ P ( data not shown ) . 
Effect of phosphorylation on oligomerization of PhoP and PhoPHis
To determine the oligomeric state of PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis and PhoPHis ~ P , these proteins were subjected to gel ﬁltration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column that was calibrated with molecular mass standards . 
PhoP and PhoP ~ P phosphorylated by GST-PhoQcyto were individually applied to the gel ﬁltration column . 
PhoP and PhoP ~ P eluted as two peaks ( Fig. 2a , b ) . 
The earlier - ( 60 ml ) and later-eluted ( 71 ml ) peaks corresponded to masses of 55 and 24 kDa , respectively . 
These values are consistent with PhoP being in the monomeric ( 24 kDa ) and dimeric ( 55 kDa ) states , and suggest that both PhoP and PhoP ~ P are in dynamic equilibrium between these two oligomeric states . 
Strikingly , when PhoPHis was applied to the column , the elution proﬁle differed greatly . 
Unpho-sphorylated PhoPHis was eluted essentially as a single peak at 67 ml ( 30 kDa ) , indicative of a monomer ( Fig. 2c ) . 
This peak presented a shoulder , towards the higher molecular masses at 57 ml ( 69 kDa ) , which may correspond to small amounts of dimer ( Fig. 2c ) . 
In contrast , phosphorylated PhoPHis was eluted as two peaks at 67 ml ( 30 kDa ) and 57 ml ( 69 kDa ) , indicating that PhoPHis ~ P exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution ( Fig. 2d ) . 
Overall , these data show that unphosphorylated PhoP and PhoPHis have different oligomeric states in solution , suggesting that the C-terminal His tag affects the stability of the dimer . 
They also indicate that phosphorylation has no major effect on dimerization of wild-type PhoP .

Tryptophan ﬂuorescence and ANS binding
PhoP ~ P 
To further characterize the different behaviours of PhoP and PhoPHis in solution , we measured the ﬂuorescence of the intrinsic tryptophan residues , which is related to their microenvironment ( Lakowicz , 1999 ) . 
Both PhoP and PhoPHis contain two tryptophan residues , which are located in the receiver domain ( Trp 67 and Trp 85 ) . 
The ﬂuorescence spectrum obtained for PhoP exhibited a His blue-shifted ( ~ 8 nm ) emission maximum and a 1 ? 
7-fold increase in intensity at 346 nm , compared to that of PhoP ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Phosphorylation of PhoP and PhoPHis resulted in 1 ? 
1 - and 2-fold decreases in ﬂuorescence intensity at 346 nm , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These data indicate that the environment of the tryptophan residues is different for PhoPHis and PhoP . 
They also indicate that phosphorylation of PhoPHis results in an important change in the micro-environment of the tryptophan residues . 
The difference in ﬂuorescence intensity between PhoPHis , which is essentially monomeric ( Fig. 2c ) , and PhoP , PhoP ~ P and PhoPHis ~ P , which exist as mixtures of monomers and dimers ( Fig. 2a , b , d ) , might be attributed to quenching effects induced by dimerization .

The gel was stained with Coomassie blue . 
( b ) Kinetics of phosphorylation of PhoP ( $ ) and PhoP ( & ) by membranes His enriched in the PhoQ protein . 
Reactions were performed for various time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE . 
The amount of 32 P associated with the PhoP proteins was determined using a PhosphorImager . 
( c ) Stability of PhoP ~ P in the presence of EDTA . 
Following phosphorylation of PhoP , EDTA was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM and PhoP ~ P was separated from the PhoQ-containing membranes by centrifugation . 
The superna-tant was dialysed at 4 6C against SPR buffer . 
Aliquots of PhoP ~ P were subjected to SDS-PAGE following the phosphorylation reaction ( lane 1 ) , a 24 h dialysis ( lane 2 ) and a 48 h dialysis ( lane 3 ) . 
The ﬂuorescent hydrophobic dye ANS binds to solventexposed hydrophobic surfaces of proteins ( Stryer , 1965 ) . 
This leads to both a blue-shifted emission spectrum of ANS and increased ﬂuorescence intensity . 
In the presence of PhoP , the ANS emission spectrum showed a 19 nm blue shift and a 2 ? 
3-fold increase in intensity ( Fig. 4 ) . 
In the presence of PhoPHis , the emission maximum of ANS showed a blue shift of 33 nm and a 4 ? 
5-fold increase in ﬂuorescence intensity ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The more drastic changes in 
ANS ﬂuorescence induced by PhoPHis , compared to PhoP , indicate that PhoPHis contains more exposed hydrophobic surfaces than PhoP . 
Phosphorylation of PhoPHis affected the ANS ﬂuorescence spectrum by inducing a red shift of 6 nm and a 1 ? 
4-fold decrease in ﬂuorescence intensity ( Fig. 4 ) . 
In contrast , phosphorylation of PhoP did not affect the ANS ﬂuorescence spectrum ( Fig. 4 ) . 
These data indicate that phosphorylation lowers the number of ANS binding sites on 
PhoPHis , suggesting a phosphorylation-induced change of conformation and/or oligomerization state for PhoPHis . 
As a control , we examined the emission spectra of PhoP and PhoPHis unfolded with 7 ? 
0 M urea . 
The presence of urea resulted in emission spectra similar to that of ANS ( data not shown ) , indicating a complete loss of the ANS binding sites upon unfolding . 
Altogether , these data strongly suggest that the C-terminal His tag affects the conformation and/or oligomerization state of PhoP , which could explain the unexpected behaviour of unphosphorylated PhoPHis .

DNA binding of PhoP proteins by SPR
A BIAcore biosensor was used to examine , in real-time , the binding of the various PhoP proteins to the promoter of mgtA ( a PhoP-activated gene that contains a PhoP box in its promoter ) . 
Biotinylated oligonucleotide duplexes containing the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter were immobilized on a streptavidin sensor chip , and PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis or PhoPHis ~ P , at concentrations ranging from 0 ? 
1 to 1 mM , was injected over the DNA surface . 
As a control , we measured the binding of the various PhoP proteins to DNA duplexes containing a randomized PhoP box . 
Injection of PhoP ( 0 ? 
3 mM ) over the DNA surface containing the PhoP box resulted in a net mass accumulation ( Fig. 5i ) that is 4 ? 
5-fold higher than the one detected using a DNA surface containing the randomized PhoP box ( Fig. 5ii ) . 
A similar pattern was observed for PhoP ~ P ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that the PhoP box is required for speciﬁc binding of PhoP . 
Control-corrected sensorgrams that represent the speciﬁc binding of the various PhoP proteins to the PhoP box were obtained by subtracting the control sensorgrams from the matching experimental sensorgrams ( Fig. 6 ) . 
For both PhoP and PhoP ~ P , control-corrected sensorgrams are characterized by a net mass accumulation during the association phase , and similar association rates ( Fig. 6a , b ) . 
As deduced from the shape of the dissociation phase , complexes between DNA and PhoP or PhoP ~ P are very stable over time ( Fig. 6a , b ) . 
Thus , phosphorylation of PhoP does not appear to affect the kinetics of association and dissociation of the complex between PhoP and DNA . 
To assess the effect of phosphorylation on the interaction of PhoP with the PhoP box , we compared the RU values at the end of the association phase . 
For PhoP at a concentration of 1 mM , phosphorylation decreased speciﬁc binding by approximately 150 RU , which corresponds to a 1 ? 
3-fold decrease . 
These results indicate that the interaction between PhoP and the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter is barely affected by phosphorylation . 
When the PhoPHis or PhoPHis ~ P protein was injected over the DNA surfaces , a greater net mass accumulation was observed for PhoPHis ~ P than for PhoPHis ( Fig. 6c , d ) . 
Phosphorylation of PhoPHis induced a twofold increase of the binding of PhoPHis to the PhoP box , as deduced from the RU values at the end of the association phase ( Fig. 6c , d ) . 
In contrast to what was observed for PhoP , phosphorylation of PhoPHis signiﬁcantly increased DNA binding . 
These data indicate that the C-terminal His tag somehow interferes with the interaction of unphosphorylated PhoPHis with the PhoP box . 
They also indicate that PhoPHis regains its ability to interact with the PhoP box upon phosphorylation . 
DISCUSSION
In this study , we examined the effect of phosphorylation on the oligomerization state and DNA-binding ability of the S. enterica PhoP response regulator . 
We used the mgtA promoter , which contains a single PhoP box , to study the interaction between PhoP and DNA . 
We found that phosphorylation of wild-type PhoP barely affects its oligo-meric state and its ability to interact with the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter . 
This indicates that the mechanism of phosphorylation-mediated activation of PhoP is different from that of many other response regulators , including E. coli OmpR and PhoB . 
In addition , we showed that the presence of a His tag at the C-terminus of PhoP greatly affects the biochemical properties of the protein .

Our data clearly showed that both wild-type PhoP and PhoP ~ P exist as a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution ( Fig. 2a , b ) . 
In contrast to what was observed for the ArcA response regulator ( Jeon et al. , 2001 ) , higher-order oligomers were not detected under our experimental conditions . 
In addition , phosphorylation of PhoP did not appear to signiﬁcantly increase the proportion of dimers ( Fig. 2a , b ) . 
These data indicate that the oligomeric state of PhoP is phosphorylation independent . 
They also suggest that PhoP is involved in a monomer -- dimer equilibrium that is concentration dependent rather than phosphorylation dependent . 
We determined the oligomeric state of PhoP and

This was followed by injection of SPR buffer alone ( dissociation phase ) . 
The graph shows the binding of PhoP ( i ) to biotinylated oligonucleotide duplexes containing the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter , and ( ii ) to biotinylated oligonucleotide duplexes containing a rando-mized PhoP box . 
PhoP ~ P at a protein concentration of 10 mM ( Fig. 2a , b ) . 
It has been estimated that the cellular concentration of PhoP ranges between 2 and 11 mM , depending on the presence of Mg in the growth medium ( Lejona et al. , 2004 ) . 
A cellular 2 + concentration in the same range ( 6 mM ) was estimated for the OmpR response regulator ( Cai & Inouye , 2002 ) . 
At such concentrations , it is most likely that PhoP dimers will form , in vivo , regardless of the PhoP phosphorylation state . 
Our results regarding the oligomeric state of PhoP are in contrast to those reported for many response regulators . 
For example , phosphorylation is required for dimerization of E. coli PhoB ( Fiedler & Weiss , 1995 ; McCleary , 1996 ) , whereas PhoP has been reported to be dimeric inde-BSU pendently of its phosphorylation state ( Liu & Hulett , 1997 ) . 
Our SPR experiments ( Fig. 6 ) clearly showed that both PhoP and PhoP ~ P bind to the PhoP box of the mgtA promoter . 
This is in contrast to the OmpR and PhoB response regulators that poorly interact with DNA when unphosphorylated ( Aiba et al. , 1989 ; Makino et al. , 1989 ) . 
Recently , it has been shown that the unphosphorylated receiver domain of PhoB inhibits the activity of the DNA-binding domain , and that this inhibition is relieved upon phosphorylation ( Ellison & McCleary , 2000 ) . 
Our data suggest that such a mechanism is most unlikely for PhoP . 
Overall , this study clearly showed that the S. enterica PhoP protein dimerizes and binds to the mgtA promoter regardless of its phosphorylation state . 
Thus , structural rearrangements that occur upon phosphorylation do not signiﬁcantly affect the oligomeric state and the ability of PhoP to interact with DNA . 
Although S. enterica PhoP belongs to the same subfamily of response regulators as OmpR and PhoB , their mechanisms of activation appear to be different . 
S. enterica or E. coli PhoP response regulators with a Cterminal His tag have been used in previous studies ( Lejona et al. , 2003 , 2004 ; Minagawa et al. , 2003 ; Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) . 
Hypothesizing that a His tag at the C-terminus of the DNA-binding domain may interfere with the ability of PhoP to interact with DNA , we systematically compared the in vitro biochemical properties of PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis and PhoPHis ~ P. Strikingly , we found that the His tag speciﬁcally affects the properties of unphosphorylated PhoPHis . 
Both stability of the dimer ( Fig. 2c ) and binding to target DNA ( Fig. 6c ) were impaired for unphosphorylated PhoPHis . 
These results suggest that the C-terminal His tag may affect the function of PhoPHis . 
This possibility is strongly supported by our ﬂuorescence experiments . 
Both the intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence measurements ( Fig. 3 ) and the ANS binding experiments ( Fig. 4 ) clearly indicated that unphosphorylated PhoP and PhoPHis have different conformations , and/or oligomerization states . 
Recently , the crystal structure of the full-length Thermotoga maritima DrrD response regulator has been solved ( Buckler et al. , 2002 ) . 
This is the ﬁrst three-dimensional structure of a fulllength member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily . 
Examination of the DrrD structure suggests that extension of the protein at its C-terminus may introduce a steric hindrance with the four-stranded b-sheet located at the N-terminus of the DNA-binding domain . 
This b-sheet appears to be involved in interdomain interactions ( Buckler et al. , 2002 ) . 
It is possible that steric hindrance induced by the His tag reduces PhoPHis ﬂexibility and/or affects interdomain communication . 
In turn , this would result in a locked conformation less permissive for PhoPHis dimerization . 
Interestingly , our results showed that PhoPHis forms stable dimers and interacts with target DNA upon phosphorylation ( Fig. 2d , Fig. 6d ) . 
In addition , the tryptophan ﬂuorescence spectrum of PhoPHis ~ P is very similar to that of PhoP ~ P ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This suggests that a phosphorylation-induced conformational change released the steric hindrance imposed by the C-terminal His tag . 
These results are in good agreement with the proposal that the phosphorylation-induced conformational change is propagated up to the C-terminus of response regulators and promotes a repositioning of the N - and C-terminal domains ( Stock & West , 2003 ) .

Using gel mobility-shift assays and DNase I footprinting , a previous study showed that phosphorylation of PhoPHis enhanced its binding to the promoters that contain a consensus PhoP box ( Lejona et al. , 2003 ) . 
Another study used chemical cross-linking to show that self-association of PhoPHis is increased by phosphorylation ( Lejona et al. , 2004 ) . 
Our data obtained with PhoPHis strongly support these ﬁndings . 
However , our data obtained with PhoP indicate that these conclusions may not be relevant for wildtype PhoP . 
Thus , we propose that unphosphorylated PhoP binds to the PhoP box of target genes , most likely as a dimer . 
As in the case of OmpR ( Ames et al. , 1999 ) , the interaction of PhoP with DNA might stimulate PhoP phosphorylation by its cognate sensor kinase . 
Since there are only single , if any , PhoP boxes in the promoters of known PhoP-activated genes ( Lejona et al. , 2003 ) , phosphorylation of PhoP is unlikely to favour cooperative binding between PhoP dimers at the PhoP-activated promoters , as previously observed for OmpR ( Harlocker et al. , 1995 ) . 
With very few exceptions , response regulators are active in their phosphorylated forms . 
Thus , it is possible that the role of PhoP phosphorylation is to favour protein -- protein interactions with the transcriptional machinery . 
This possibility is supported by previous studies showing that PhoB interacts with s ( Kumar et al. , 1994 ; Makino et al. , 1993 ) , and 70 that OmpR interacts with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase a subunit ( Slauch et al. , 1991 ) .
