and taste , with the risk of survival of food-borne pathogens in these foods ( Abee and Wouters 1999 ) . 
And last but not least , ( v ) the evolution of new strains . 
New properties including antibiotic and stress resistance and toxin production may be acquired via ( horizontal ) gene transfer and may be located on plasmids ( Brussow et al. 2004 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium deﬁnitive phage type DT104 ( S. Typhimurium DT104 ) was ﬁrst reported in the UK in 1984 ( Wall et al. 1994 ; Threlfall et al. 1996 ) . 
The epidemic strain has an antibiotic resistance pattern characterized by resistance to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfonamides , and tetracycline ( ACSSuT ) that is located on the Salmonella genomic island 1 ( SG-1 ) ( Boyd et al. 2001 ) . 
During the last decade there is a large increase of S. Typhimurium DT104 in the Netherlands ( Van Pelt et al. 2003 ) . 
In the period 1990 -- 2001 the percentage of all human Salmonella isolates typed DT104 in the Netherlands rose from 0Æ66 to 18 % in 2001 probably promoted by transpor-tation of manure between farms ( Van Pelt et al. 2003 ) . 
Several reports have indicated that these emerging S. Typhimurium DT104 are more virulent in humans than other salmonellas . 
Wall et al. ( 1994 ) found a higher mortality and morbidity in patients infected with S. Typhimurium DT104 . 
Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 strains were found to be more acid resistant ( De Jonge et al. 2003 ) than other salmonellas . 
As the stomach with its acidic pH is recognized as the ﬁrst line of defence against food-borne pathogens , acid resistance of pathogens may contribute to their virulence . 
For this study we collected 37 S. Typhimurium DT104 strains and tested them for acid resistance and investigated whether human isolates are more acid resistant than nonhuman isolates . 
Therefore , the sequence of rpoS ( the master regulator of stress response in Salmonella ) , heat resistance , and 2D protein proﬁles of high acid-resistant and low acid-resistant strains were determined to investigate whether these strains differ not only in acid resistance but also in other stress response determinants .

after which the bacteria were used in the different experiments . 
Growth media consisted of LBG ( 10 g tryptone , 10 g NaCl , 5 g yeast extract and 4 g glucose per litre ) buffered with 100 mmol l 2-morpholine-ethanesulfanic ) 1 acid monohydrate and set at pH 5Æ0 . 
LBG was inoculated with 1 % BHI culture and cells were grown for 18 h without shaking at 37 C to obtain stationary phase cultures . 
Acid resistance
Studies were conducted in closed 30-ml bottles containing a volume of 25 ml . 
Bacterial cultures were grown overnight for 18 h without shaking in buffered LBG pH 5 at 37 C . 
The overnight cultures yielded approx . 
10 CFU ml . 
8 ) 1 Cultures were acidiﬁed to pH 2Æ5 using 6 mol l ) 1 HCl and subsequently 5 ml was added to 25 ml fresh buffered LBG pH 2Æ5 , and incubated at 37 C. Samples were taken before acidiﬁcation ( t 1/4 0 ) and after 1 and 2 h at pH 2Æ5 and subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37 C after dilution in peptone physiological salt solution ( PPSS ) containing 9 g NaCl and 1 g peptone per litre and plating on tryptone soy agar ( TSA ) . 
Survival was calculated as percentage survival at t 1/4 x : AR 1/4 ( CFUt 1/4 x/CFUt 1/4 0 ) · 100 % . 
Strains of which the level of survival was > 10 % after 2 h at pH 2Æ5 were considered high acid resistant , whereas strains of which the level of survival was smaller than 0Æ01 % were considered low acid resistant . 
All other strains were considered intermediate acid resistant . 
Heat resistance
Bacterial cultures were grown overnight for 18 h without shaking in buffered LBG pH 5 at 37 C. Cultures were transferred ( 10 % ) in prewarmed LBG pH 5Æ0 and incubated at 55 C in 10-ml tubes . 
Samples were taken directly and after 1 and 2 h at 55 C and subsequently diluted in PPSS and plated on TSA and incubated for 24 at 37 C. Survival was calculated as percentage survival at t 1/4 x : HR 1/4 ( CFUt 1/4 x/CFUt 1/4 0 ) · 100 % . 
Bacterial strains and culture conditions Total cellular protein extraction
Thirty-seven S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 isolates were collected from both human ( 27 strains ) and nonhuman ( nine strains ) sources . 
Two Salmonella reference strains were included : BAA-188 , a human DT104 isolate from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and LT-2 , a S. Typhimurium PT2 strain that was recently sequenced ( McClelland et al. 2001 ) ( see Table 1 ) . 
All strains were stored at ) 70 C in Brain Heart Infusion broth ( BHI ) ( Brunswich Chemie , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) containing 50 % glycerol . 
Strains were allowed to recover from ) 70 C for 8 h at 37 C in BHI without shaking 
Cells were harvested by centrifuging 10-ml cultures for 10 min at 3000 g and the pellet was resuspended in water containing a protease inhibitor ( 5 mmol l pefabloc ) . ) 
1 Subsequently , cells were disrupted by bead beating ( three times for 1 min ) with zirconium beads ( 0Æ1-mm diameter ; Biospec Products , Bartlesville , OK , USA ) in a MSK cell homogenizer ( B. Braun Biotech International , Melsungen , Germany ) . 
In between the treatments the cell extract was cooled on ice . 
The protein concentration in cell extracts was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St Louis , MO , USA ) . 
Protein analysis was performed with a Multiphor 2D-EF system ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) as described by the manufacturer . 
Essentially , prior to loading the samples on the isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) gel 40 ll of protein ( 40 lg ) was treated with 40 ll lysis solution [ 9 mol l urea , 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol , 2 % IPG buffer ) 1 4-7 ( Pharmacia Biotech ) , 2 % Triton X-100 ] at room temperature for 2 min , after which 80 ll sample solution ( 8 mol l urea , 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol , 2 % IPG buffer 4-7 , ) 1 0Æ5 % Triton X-100 , a few grains of bromophenol blue ) was added . 
At the acidic end of the ﬁrst-dimension IEF gels with linear pH ranges from 4 to 7 ( Immobiline Dry strips , Pharmacia Biotech ) the total volume ( 160 ll ) was loaded . 
Subsequently , the proteins were separated on precast gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels ( 12 -- 14 % ) ( Pharmacia Biotech ) . 
The gels were silver-stained as described by Blum et al. ( 1987 ) . 
The experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate , and representative gels are shown . 
The gels were analysed , integrated , and normalized by using PD-Quest software ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Determination of amino acid identities using Maldi-TOF MS
Protein samples ( 750 lg ) were separated on the 2D-EF gels under conditions identical to those used for the running of analytical gels . 
Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and subsequently Maldi-TOF MS analysis of manually excised spots was carried out at the Maastricht Proteomics Centre ( Department of Human Biology , University of 
Maastricht , Maastricht , the Netherlands ) by in-gel trypsin digestion in a Mass Prep-station and subsequent analysis with a Maldi-TOF LR Mass spectrometer ( Micromass , Almere , the Netherlands ) . 
Peptide mass ﬁngerprints were analysed using Mascot MS/MS search engine ( Matrix Science Ltd , London , UK ) . 
Sequencing of the rpoS gene
DNA sequences of both strands of the rpoS gene were determined by primerwalking . 
Therefore , the coding region of rpoS was ampliﬁed using Pwo DNA polymerase ( Roche Diagnostics , Almere , the Netherlands ) on a MJ PTC-200 thermalcycler ( Biozym , Landgraaf , the Netherlands ) . 
Nuc-leotide sequencing reactions were performed with puriﬁed PCR products using AmpliTaq FS DNA polymerase Fluor-escent dye terminator reactions ( Perkin-Elmer , Groningen , the Netherlands ) as recommended by the supplier . 
Sequen-cing products were detected using an Applied Biosystems 373A stretch automated DNA sequencer ( Applied Bio-systems , Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel , the Netherlands ) . 
Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed with the Lasergene analysis package ( DNASTAR , Madison , WI , USA ) .

Acid resistance
Mimicking bacterial passage in a resting human stomach , bacteria were challenged for 2 h at pH 2Æ5 . 
A signiﬁcant difference could be detected between human and food isolates regarding their acid resistance properties . 
The level of survival of S. Typhimurium DT104 strains exposed to pH 2Æ5 varied strongly ( Table 1 ) . 
Six of the S. Typhimu-rium DT104 strains were high acid resistant , 13 DT104 strains and the reference strain BAA-118 were intermediate acid resistant and 18 strains and the reference strain LT-2 were low acid resistant . 
The mean acid resistance of human nonreference strains was signiﬁcantly higher after 1 h ( P 1/4 0Æ00092 ) and after 2 h ( P 1/4 0Æ0079 ) using a Student 's t-test for independent samples assuming unequal variances . 
This Student 's t-test was performed on a linear scale but the same statistical analysis on a logarithmic scale gave also signiﬁcant differences . 
In addition to the two reference strains , we selected four S. Typhimurium DT104 strains and used these in further experiments . 
Selection was based on isolation source and acid resistance . 
We selected two human isolates : strain 2945 ( high acid resistant ) and strain 911 ( low acid resistant ) . 
Moreover , two food isolates were selected : strain 3633 ( intermediate acid resistant ) and strain 327 ( low acid resistant strain ) . 
Heat resistance
Heat resistance of acid-adapted stationary phase cells was determined at 55 C in LBG pH 5Æ0 . 
The level of survival after 2 h was approx . 
0Æ035 % for the S. Typhimurium DT104 strains except for strain 327 and 2945 that respectively showed a small increased survival of 0Æ11 and 0Æ26 % after 2 h at 55 C. However , we did not ﬁnd a correlation between heat resistance and acid resistance as strain 327 was characterized as low acid resistant and strain 2945 as high acid resistant . 
rpoS status of the S. Typhimurium DT104 strains 
To determine whether mutations in the rpoS gene could explain the differences in acid resistance in the different S. Typhimurium DT104 strains we sequenced the rpoS gene including the promoter region of the six selected strains . 
Sequence analysis did not reveal any mutations in the rpoS gene and no differences were detected in the promoter region when compared with DT104 sequences found in the GenBank database ( data not shown ) . 
Consequently , differences in acid resistance in the DT104 strains are not the result of mutations in rpoS . 
The sequence of the rpoS gene of S. Typhimurium LT2 was found to be identical to the one deposited in GenBank including its TTG start codon which differs from the wild type ATG start codon . 
The ATG start codon is required for sustaining an acid tolerance response at low pH in exponential phase S. Typhimurium cells adapted at pH 4Æ5 ( Lee et al. 1995 ) . 
Moreover , this rpoS allele in S. Typhimurium LT2 was demonstrated to be important in the avirulent phenotype of this strain ( WilmesRiesenberg et al. 1997 ) . 
Protein proﬁle of the S. Typhimurium DT104 strains
2D Gel electrophoresis was used to examine the protein composition of stationary phase cells grown in LBG pH 5Æ0 at 37 C for 18 h. On gels containing protein extracts of S. Typhimurium cells , a total of approx . 
200 proteins could be identiﬁed ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Detailed analysis of the 2D electrophor-esis gels revealed that ﬁve proteins were induced differentially in S. Typhimurium cells ( more than 1Æ5 times up or down regulated ) . 
The proteins FliC , FljB , DnaK , AtpB and GroEL were identiﬁed with MALDI-TOF MS and their expression levels compared with those in the reference strain S. Typhimurium BAA-118 were calculated ( Table 2 ) . 
Grouping the strains based on their acid resistance properties revealed an increased amount of the FliC and FljB proteins in the low acid resistant strains 911 and 327 . 
The level of expression of FljB in the high acid-resistant strain 2945 was similar to that in strain BAA-118 and FliC was even lower . 
The relative amount of ﬂagellins in the intermediate acid resistant strain 3633 was increased . 
Only in the high acid-resistant strain 2945 the amount of the beta chain of the ATP synthase , AtpB , was 3Æ7-fold higher , while in the other strains the amounts were approximately similar to that of strain BAA-118 . 
As demonstrated by measuring the heat resistance of S. Typhimurium DT104 , the strains 327 and 2945 were slightly more heat resistant at 55 C . 
The protein proﬁles showed that the relative amounts of the heat shock chaperones GroEL and DnaK were 1Æ7 - and 3Æ7-fold 
D I S C U S S I O N
As gastric ﬂuid is the ﬁrst line of defence against microbial food-borne diseases the ability of bacteria to survive in acidic environments could play a crucial role in pathogen virulence . 
In the present study , we found large variations in the level of acid resistance among S. Typhimurium DT104 strains . 
Interestingly , all high acid resistant strains were isolated from humans suggesting a positive correlation between acid resistance and pathogenicity . 
However , S. 
Typhimurium DT104 strains isolated from sweet confectioneries ( Helva , a mildly acidic product , pH approx . 
6 ) , appeared to be low acid resistant but caused a large outbreak in Sweden , Norway , Australia , Germany and Turkey ( Andersson et al. 2001 ) . 
It seems that acid resistance properties did not play a role in this outbreak , and it is assumed that the food matrix protected the bacteria against the gastric acid in the human stomach as shown previously for enteric pathogens ( Waterman and Small 1998 ) . 
Notably , a number of S. Typhimurium DT104 outbreaks have previously been associated with foods containing a high fat fraction that may offer protection during gastric transit ( Kapperud et al. 1989 , 1990 ; Vought and Tatini 1998 ; Waterman and Small 1998 ) . 
Cells that are adapted to mild acid stress usually show cross protection to many other environmental stresses ( Audia et al. 2001 ) . 
Our results demonstrate that the food isolate S. Typhimurium DT104 327 and the human isolate S. Typhimurium DT104 2945 were slightly more heat resistant . 
Proteomics showed differences in the amount of the heat shock chaperones DnaK and GroEL in strain 2945 and 327 respectively . 
This may provide an explanation for the increased heat resistance . 
One well-known response regulator is the alternative sigma factor RpoS that plays a key role in the survival of bacteria under stress conditions ( Hengge-Aronis 2002 ) . 
Sequencing of the rpoS gene in the S. Typhimurium DT104 strains revealed no mutations or deletions . 
A similar observation was found by Robbe-Saule et al. ( 2003 ) who found that the rpoS genes of 37 human isolates of S. Typhimurium were unaltered . 
It was suggested that mutations in rpoS are counter-selected , conceivably because the alternative sigma factor RpoS plays a role in pathogenesis and/or in the transmission cycle of the disease ( Robbe-Saule et al. 2003 ) . 
Cells that are not adapted to mild acid conditions were shown to be less resistant to low pH and in this study acid-sensitive cells showed no induction or a reduced level of RpoS ( Jorgensen et al. 2000 ) . 
To ﬁnd an explanation for the differences in acid resistance levels in S. Typhimurium DT104 we examined the proteome of acid-sensitive and acid-resistant strains . 
In the low acid-resistant isolate S. Typhimurium DT104 strain 911 the relative amount of the phase 2 ﬂagellin FljB increased 82Æ4-fold . 
Adams et al. ( 2001 ) suggested that ﬂagella-mediated cell motility is co-regulated by low pH via the PhoPQ signal transduction pathway and that ﬂagellar repression at low pH conserves ATP for survival and decreases inﬂux of protons into the cytosol as ﬂagella are driven directly by proton inﬂux ( MacNab 2003 ) . 
Therefore , the relatively large amounts of ﬂagellar protein in strain 911 may have contributed to poor survival at low pH. However , in the low acid-resistant strain 327 an increased expression of ﬂagellar proteins is not found although it is acid sensitive . 
Obviously other cellular parameters are involved in acid resistance . 
In the human acid-resistant isolate S. Typhimurium DT104 2945 a relatively large amount of AtpB was found , the beta chain of the H / ATPase in + Salmonella . 
A role for the H + / ATPase in pH homeostasis in Salmonella has been suggested previously ( Foster and Hall 1990 ) by studying an ATPase deletion mutant . 
A role for the H / ATPase in acid resistance was also suggested in + the Gram-positive Lactococcus lactis , in which at lower pH values ( 5Æ5 vs 7 ) higher levels of H + / ATPase coincided with increased acid resistance ( O'Sullivan and Condon et al. 1999 ) . 
Recently , De Jonge ( 2003 ) demonstrated that growth at pH 5 compared with growth at pH 7 resulted in + slightly lower amounts of H / ATPase in a range of S. 
Typhimurium DT104 strains . 
In addition , no correlation was found between the amount of H / ATPase and acid + resistance properties of the individual strains . 
The exact role of the H / ATPase in pH 2Æ5 acid resistance and the + contribution of other cellular parameters to survival of S. Typhimurium DT104 under these conditions remain to be elucidated . 
Our results with S. Typhimurium DT104 point to a positive correlation between acid resistance and pathogen-icity as previously suggested for enteric bacteria by Bearson et al. ( 1997 ) . 
The role of acid resistance in virulence will be further tested in in vitro studies by investigating survival in acidic macrophages and in in vivo studies by using a rat model allowing assessment of the survival capacities of the different DT104 isolates during gastric passage .
