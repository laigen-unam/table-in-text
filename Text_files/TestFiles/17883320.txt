Introduction
Abstract 
The prevalence of Salmonella isolated from a poultry farm and from the poultry processing plant environment were evaluated from August 2004 to July 2005 along with microbial antibiotic resistance . 
In total , 3242 samples were collected from the farm and processing plant . 
Samples collected from the farm included hatching eggs , paper liners , litter , feed , water , drinkers , air , bird rinse , and ceca . 
While samples collected from the processing plant included carcass rinse and ceca . 
Out of 2882 samples collected from the farm , the overall percentage prevalence of Salmonella was 5.4 % with prevalence rates of 10 % , 1.5 % , 0.7 % , 0.2 % , 13.5 % , and 12.6 % for hatching eggs , litter , feed , drinkers , bird rinse and ceca , respectively . 
No Salmonella were detected in any of the paper liner , water , or air samples . 
Out of 360 samples collected from the processing plant , the overall percentage prevalence of Salmonella was 4.7 % with prevalence rates of 6.1 % and 3.3 % for carcass rinse and ceca samples , respectively . 
Salmonella Enteritidis was the most prevalent serotype . 
All of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 10 different resistance proﬁles were found among 173 isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Resistance to ampicillin , nalidixic acid , and tetracycline were the most common . 
The widespread occurrence of multiple resistant Salmonella Enteritidis is a cause for concern , and local regulatory enforcement agencies should ensure prudent use of antibiotics . 
The Kuwaiti poultry industry is an important component of the Kuwaiti food industry generating employment and millions of dollars in annual revenue . 
The local poultry industry covers 48 % and 55 % of the local consumption of poultry meat and eggs with the remainder of the population covered by importation . 
The per capita consumption of poultry and eggs in Kuwait is one of the highest in the world with an average production of 38,000 tons of poultry meat and 330 million eggs . 
Thus , a challenge exists for poultry producers to ensure the safety of poultry . 
Contamination of poultry by foodborne pa-thogens is considered a major problem threatening the poultry industry in Kuwait . 
During the last 5 years , the poultry producers in Kuwait suffered major economic losses due to lack of an effective pathogen reducing = monitoring program for poultry . 
On two occasions in 2006 , Kuwait Municipality banned locally produced broilers from the market because of the high incidence of Salmonella contamination . 
Personal communication with the Public Authority for Agricultural and Fisheries Resources ( PAAFR ) revealed that more than 20 % of poultry are Salmonella positive prior to slaughter and that this percentage increases during processing and handling . 
In fact , previous studies show Salmo-nella presence on 100 % of fresh domestic chicken and 60 % of frozen imported carcasses ( AbuRuwaida et al. , 1994 ; Sawaya , 1992 ) . 
Furthermore , the Kuwait Ministry of Health reported a total of 319 cases of food poisoning per 100,000 of population for the year 1994 . 
The etiological agent responsible for such diseases included Salmonella Enteritidis , Shigella spp. , Giardia , and Brucella ( Anonymous , 1994 ) . 
However , the vehicle of transmission responsible for the illness is rarely reported . 
To our knowledge , little information is known about Salmonella antibiotic resistance or susceptibility and the correlation between the use of antimicrobial agents in poultry and the emergence of Salmonella strains with decreased susceptibility or complete resistance to antibiotics . 
The World Health Organization has pointed out an alarming increase in resistance to a number of antibiotics among Salmonella isolated from animal and human sources worldwide , with the most common combination of multiple resistance being ampicillin , sulfanomides , streptomycin , chloramphenicol , and tetracyclines ( Brisabois et al. , 1997 ) . 
The emergence of multiple resistant Salmonella has been attributed to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food animal production , which can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of poultry products . 
Thus , the collection of baseline data about the incidence of Salmonella in poultry and their antibiotic susceptibility would provide vital information to both the production industry and public health authorities in Kuwait and help in setting priorities for further sur-veillance and epidemiological interventions for the reduction of Salmonella in poultry . 
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Salmonella and their antibiotic susceptibility proﬁles in one poultry production farm and processing plant in the State of Kuwait .

Materials and Methods
Farm location
The poultry farm surveyed in this study represents one of the largest poultry companies in Kuwait City , Kuwait . 
This farm is located 50 km from the capital State of Kuwait and is located in areas reserved for the poultry industry . 
The poultry farm consists of three broiler houses each housing 20,000 birds . 
Birds are kept until 35 days of age . 
All poultry operational sections such as hatchery , feed mill , processing plant , and meat storage area are located nearby ( approximately 5 km ) . 
Sample collection
Sampling was carried out over a period of one year and during six grow-out periods ( August 2004 -- September 2005 ) . 
Samples were obtained from the farm and the processing plant . 
Hatching eggs were collected at day of arrival to farm hatchery . 
Environmental ( paper liner , litter , feed , water , drinkers , and air ) and chicken samples were collected from the three houses at the farm at week 3 and week 5 of each grow out period . 
Chicken carcasses were obtained at day 35 ( day of processing ) of each grow-out period . 
Hatching eggs
Eggs were collected from the company 's hatchery which has a capacity of 60,000 fertile eggs . 
Fertilized eggs were mainly imported from India . 
Eggs collected from the hatchery were surface sterilized by soaking a sterile sponge in ethyl alcohol ( 70 % v = v ) and wiping the surface of the egg for 3 minutes , air drying in a laminar ﬂow cabinet , and then cracking on the edge with a sterile spatula . 
The egg content was mixed thoroughly and 25 g was then placed in a sterile stomacher bag and diluted 1:10 with buffered peptone water . 
Environmental samples
The prevalence of Salmonella in the environment was determined from three broiler houses , which received the one-day-old chicks from the hatchery . 
Paper liners from the hatchery transport boxes were collected at the time the chicks were brought to each house ( n 1/4 24 ) . 
Other environmental samples also included litter ( n 1/4 550 ) , feed ( n 1/4 550 ) , drinker ( n 1/4 546 ) , and air ( n 1/4 72 ) . 
Paper tray liners ( 10 g ) from transport boxes , litter samples ( 10 g ) , feed samples ( 10 g ) , and water samples ( 10 mL ) were collected in sterile stomacher bags and diluted 1:10 in 0.1 % buff-ered peptone water . 
Drinkers were swabbed with ﬁve sterile cotton tip swabs on the outside of each nippl drinker and on its entire internal surface of its associated cup . 
After sampling , swabs were transferred directly into sterile test tube containing 5 mL of 0.1 % buffered peptone water . 
Air was sampled prior to the placement of the chicks and during the grow-out period . 
A Petri dish containing brain -- heart infusion solid media was placed in an Oxoid Air Sampler ( Oxoid , UK ) <Please provide city location for Oxoid as well.> set to draw 60 L in 20 seconds . 
Air samples were collected from areas containing ventilation fans as well as random areas in the three houses . 
Ethyl alcohol ( 70 % ) was applied at each sampling site to sanitize the air sampler cover . 
The media was then aseptically transferred to 100 mL of 0.1 % buffered peptone water .

AL-ZENKI ET AL. . 
Whole bird, chilled carcass, and ceca samples
The prevalence of Salmonella on a bird 's body and in the ceca was determined at the farm . 
Chicken samples were sacriﬁced and the whole bird 's body was placed in large sterile stomacher bags and rinsed for 2 minutes in 400 mL of 0.1 % buffered peptone water . 
The whole bird rinse ( WBR ) solution was poured into sterile containers . 
The body surface was washed with 70 % ethyl alcohol and then aseptically dissected . 
Ceca were removed and their contents diluted 1:3 with 0.1 % buffered peptone . 
At the processing plant , the ceca were removed during the evisceration step . 
The ceca and randomly selected post-chill processed carcasses were then prepared for Salmonella detection as described above . 
Salmonella detection
Salmonella detection was carried out as outlined in theU.S . 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) BAM Salmonella isolation procedure ( FDA , 1995 ) with some modiﬁcation where buffered peptone water replaced lactose broth for pre-enrichment . 
All samples were pre-enriched at 378C for 24 hours in 0.1 % buffered peptone water . 
After incubation , 1 mL of the pre-enriched samples were transferred to 9 mL tetrathionate broth and selenite cysteine broth and incubated for 24 hours at 378C . 
Following incubation , samples were then streaked onto xylose lysine deoxycholate and bismuth sulphite agar . 
Suspected Salmonella colonies were stabbed onto triple sugar iron agar and lysine iron agar slants and presumptive Salmonella were conﬁrmed by serotyping . 
Serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing
Serotyping of Salmonella isolates was performed on the basis of somatic O and phase 1 and phase 2 ﬂagellar antigens using antisera agglutination tests according to the Kaufmann -- White scheme ( Popoff and Le Minor , 2001 ) . 
Susceptibi-lity to antimicrobial agents was performed as minimum inhibitory concentration determinations using a commercially prepared , dehydrated panel Sensititre ( Trek Diagnostics , West Sussex , UK ) towards the following antimicrobial agents : ampicillin , apramycin , cephalothin , ceftiofur , chloramphenicol , ciproﬂoxacin , amoxicilline-clavulanic acid , colistin , ﬂorfenicol , gentamicin , nalidixic acid , neomycin , spectinomycin , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole , tetracycline , and trimethoprim . 
All plates were inoculated following the guidelines recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) and the CLSI breakpoints for interpretation of the minimum inhibitory concentration results ( CLSI , 2003 ) . 
In all tests performed , a weekly quality control was conducted ; E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a reference strain . 
Results
Data on prevalence of Salmonella isolates collected from various sources at the farm and processing plant are shown in Table 1 . 
Out of 2882 samples collected at the farm , 156 samples ( 5.4 % ) were positive for Salmonella spp . 
Salmo-nella was detected in 10 % of the incoming hatching eggs . 
Contamination rate of the litter , feed and drinker samples were 1.5 % , 0.7 % , and 0.2 % , respectively . 
The whole bird rinse and ceca samples were contaminated at the rate of 13.5 % and 12.6 % , respectively . 
Salmonella were not detected in any of the paper liner , air , or water samples . 
Out of 360 samples collected at the processing plant , 17 samples ( 4.7 % ) were positive for Salmonella spp . 
The Salmonella contamination rate of the carcass rinse and ceca were 6.1 % and 3.3 % , respectively . 
Out of the total 174 Salmonella isolates , Salmonella Enteritidis accounted for 173 isolates . 
A single Sal-monella Infantis was also found . 
The occurrence of antibiotic resistance for the Salmonella Enteritidis isolates is shown in Table 2 .

resistance to one or more of the antibiotics tested . 
Almost all isolates were resistant to nali-dixic acid ( 173 isolates ) , ampicillin ( 168 isola-tes ) , and tetracycline ( 167 isolates ) . 
All nalidixic acid resistant isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin . 
Seven isolates were resistant to gentamicin , seven to trimethoprim , ﬁve to cephalothin , four to sulfamethoxazole , two to spectinomycin , two to chloramphenicol and ﬂorfenicol , and one each to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid , apramycin , ciproﬂoxacin , neomycin , and streptomycin . 
None of the isolates showed resistance to ceftiofur or colistin . 
Ten different patterns of resistance were observed among the 173 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates ( Table 3 ) . 
Multiple drug resistance of 154 isolates to ampicillin , nalidixic acid , and tetracycline was the most common ( 88.4 % ) , followed by the resistance of ﬁve isolates to nalidixic acid ( 2.9 % ) . 
A total of four isolates ( 2.3 % ) were resistant to ampicillin , gentamicin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and trimethoprim , while only three isolates ( 1.7 % ) were resistant to ampicillin , nalidixic acid , sulfamethoxazole , and tetracycline . 
Two isolates ( 1.2 % ) were resistant to ampicillin , cephalothin , nalidixic acid , and tetracycline . 
The remaining ﬁve isolates ( 3.0 % ) displayed multiple antibiotic resistance .

Discussion
The data from this study showed that the predominant serotype in one Kuwaiti poultry farm and processing plant environment was Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Salmonella Enteritidis has been documented by several researchers to be the most dominant serotype in poultry and in foodborne outbreaks associated with poultry products ( Betancor et al. , 2004 ; Antunes et al. , 2003 ; Capita et al. , 2003 ) . 
We also found that Salmonella Enteritidis was frequently isolated from the incoming hatching eggs ( 10 % ) , indicating eggs were probably the initial source of contamination . 
Salmonella Enteritidis is a path-ogen capable of trans-ovarian spread and has been reported to be isolated from the ovaries of naturally infected chicken and the yolk , albumen , and shells of intact eggs ( Barnhart et al. , 1991 ; Humphrey et al. , 1989 ) . 
Previous reports have indicated that around 0.6 % of eggs laid by naturally infected poultry ﬂocks were infected internally with Salmonella Enteritidis ( Hum-phrey et al. , 1989 , 1990 ) . 
Although only a small percentage of Salmonella-positive eggs enter the hatching cabinet , the spread of Salmonella from these eggs to other chicks have shown to be extensive ( Bailey et al. , 1998 ) . 
In fact , the presence of Salmonella in fertilized broiler hatching eggs is considered a critical control point in the Salmonella contamination of broiler chickens ( Cox et al. , 2000 ) . 
Gast and Holt ( 1998 ) have reported the ability of Salmonella Enteritidis to persist in chicken from hatchery to the laying houses . 
These results clearly indicate that importing hatching eggs from Salmonella-free breeder and layer ﬂocks and improving sanitation in the hatchery are crucial to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis presence and multiplication in the hatchery . 
The results have also shown a relatively high rate of cecal contamination in all the chicken tested ( 12.6 % ) . 
This high rate of cecal colonization contributed to the signiﬁcant increase in the isolation of Salmo-nella Enteritidis from the exterior of the chicken

( 13.5 % ) and the widespread cross-contamination in the poultry house environment . 
On the other hand , Salmonella Enteritidis were less frequently isolated from post-chilled carcasses at the processing plant ( 6.1 % ) compared to at the farm ( 13.3 % ) . 
Similarly , Salmonella Enteritidis was less frequently isolated from the ceca in the proces-sing plant ( 3.3 % ) compared to at the farm ( 12.6 % ) . 
This may possibly be due to the unhygienic conditions and the various sources of cross-contamination at the farm and the good manufacturing practices adopted by the processors in reducing the risk of Salmonella contamination during slaughtering and processing . 
This study also showed a very high prevalence rate of resistance of these isolates to the antibiotics tested . 
All the isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and other antibiotics tested . 
More than 89 % of the isolates ( n 1/4 154 ) had a similar multiple drug resistance pattern to ampicillin , nalidixic acid , and tetracycline . 
In Kuwait , antibiotics including ampicillin , nali-dixic acid , and tetracycline are regulated by the local veterinary agency and are extensively used by the local poultry industry . 
Tetracycline has also been administrated to one-day-old chicks in other countries to treat Salmonella infection ( Suresh et al. , 2006 ) . 
The resistance of Salmonella Enteritidis to these antibiotics , in particular , may be a result of the extensive use of these antibiotics for therapeutic , prophylactic , or growth-promoting purposes in local poultry production . 
Multiple drug resistanc among Salmonella Enteritidis isolates is still very uncommon . 
However , recently there has been an increase in the frequency of multiple drug resistance among Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from poultry . 
Icgen et al. ( 2002 ) characterized 82 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from chickens , eggs , and human sources with respect to resistance to antimicrobial agents . 
They reported a 45 % prevalence of multiple drug resistant Salmonella Enteritidis isolates with more than half of the multiple drug resistant isolates ( 57.1 % ) coming from chicken . 
Furthermore , Usera et al. ( 2002 ) have reported that multiple drug resistance among Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from animal sources in Spain increased from 0 % in 1996 to 3.5 % in 2000 . 
The emergence of nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella Enteritidis isolates is of public health concern . 
Marimon et al. ( 2004 ) recently reported that the overall prevalence of nalidixic acid resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis , the most frequently isolated serovar from clinical isolates , was 18.1 % . 
They concluded that the high proportion of Salmonella Enteritidis isolation and the high prevalence of nalidixic acid resistance among these isolates may explain the high frequency in Salmonella infection in humans . 
This is because nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella strains also show reduced susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin , thus limiting the few antibiotics used to treat nontyphoidal salmo-nellosis in humans ( Marimon et al. , 2004 ; Gormon et al. , 2002 ; Oteo et al. , 2000 ) . 
< The citations Gorman et al. ( 2002 ) and Oteo et al. ( 2000 ) do not have matching references . 
> Fluoroquinol-ones are in many cases the drug of choice for treatment of gastrointestinal infections in humans and resistance or reduced susceptibility to this class of antimicrobial agents is associated with increased morbidity and mortality ( Helms et al. , 2002 , 2004 ) . 
In conclusion , this study conﬁrms the persistence of Salmonella Enteritidis in one of the largest broiler production operation in Kuwait . 
The high prevalence of multiple drug resistant Salmonella Enteritidis is alarming and indicates widespread and unrestricted use of veterinary antibiotics in poultry production in the local broiler production operation under investigation . 
The results of this study will be useful to the remaining two broiler production operations because they all share similar broiler production practices .
