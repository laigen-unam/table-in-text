ABSTRACT 
Propionate kinase catalyses the last step in the anaerobic breakdown of - threonine to propionate in which L propionyl phosphate and ADP are converted to propionate and ATP . 
Here we report the structures of propionate kinase ( TdcD ) in the native form as well as in complex with dia-denosine 5 0,5000-P1 , P4-tetraphosphate ( Ap4A ) by X-ray crystallography . 
Structure of TdcD obtained after cocrystallization with ATP showed Ap4A bound to the active site pocket suggesting the presence of Ap4A synthetic activity in TdcD . 
Binding of Ap A to the enzyme was confirmed 4 by the structure determination of a TdcD-Ap4A complex obtained after cocrystallization of TdcD with commercially available Ap4A . 
Mass spectroscopic studies provided further evidence for the formation of Ap4A by propionate kinase in the presence of ATP . 
In the TdcD-Ap4A complex structure , Ap4A is present in an extended conformation with one adenosine moiety present in the nucleotide binding site and other in the proposed propionate binding site . 
These observations tend to support direct in-line transfer of phosphoryl group during the kinase reaction . 
INTRODUCTION
L-Threonine is anaerobically degraded to propionate via 2-ketobutyrate by biodegradative threonine deaminase , 2-ketobutyrate formate lyase , phosphotran-sacetylase , and propionate kinase .1 The last step in this process , conversion of propionyl phosphate and ADP to propionate and ATP is catalyzed by propionate kinase ( EC 2.7.1.15 ) . 
Propionate kinase ( TdcD ) from Salmonella typhimurium has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli . 
The crystal structures of the recombinant enzyme in complex with ADP and nonhydrolysable ATP analog AMPNP have been determined earlier .2 The polypeptide fold of TdcD contains a core similar to those of acetate kinase , sugar kinase , heat shock cognate 70 and actin , the ASKHA superfamily of phosphotransferases . 
This superfamily is characterized by two domains , each with the topology bbbababa separated by an active site cleft .3 In the members of this superfamily , phosphoryl transfer is coupled to a large conformational change in which the two domains close around the active site pocket . 
The structures of TdcD complexes have permitted identification of catalytically essential residues involved in the substrate binding and catalysis . 
The structure of TdcD-AMPPNP reveals the optimal position for the g-phosphate poised for catalysis . 
The cryoprotectant ethylene glycol ( EDO ) was observed in the proposed propionate binding site , reflecting the mode of propionate binding . 
Studies on acetate kinase , a homologue of propionate kinase with significant amino acid sequence identity , have shown an inversion of configuration during phosphoryl transfer4 suggesting either a direct in-line transfer or a covalent triple displacement mechanism involving two phosphoenzyme intermediates . 
The direct in-line transfer mechanism was supported by steady-state kinetics as well as stereo-chemical evidence whereas the triple displacement mechanism was proposed when a phosphoenzyme was isolated after incubating E. coli acetate kinase with radiolabeled ATP or acetyl phosphate and the isolated phosphoenzyme was able to transfer the phosphoryl group to ADP or acetate .5 Recent structural and biochemical studies carried out on acetate and propionate kinases have provided additional support for the direct in-line transfer of the phosphoryl group from ATP to acetate/propionate .2,6 Here we report the crystal structures of Salmonella typhimurium propionate kinase and its complexes obtained after cocrystallization with ATP as well as Ap4A . 
Structure of unliganded TdcD has provided information about the conformational change which takes place in the active site pocket upon ligand binding . 
Crystals of TdcD obtained in the presence of ATP clearly showed Ap4A bound in the active site pocket of the enzyme . 
Further , mass spectroscopic studies and cocrystallization trials of TdcD with commercially available Ap4A confirmed its formation and binding to the enzyme . 
Thus , the pres-ent work demonstrates that the propionate kinase from S. typhimurium can synthesize diadenosine 5 0,5000-P1 , P4-tetraphosphate ( Ap4A ) from ATP . 
Structure of TdcD in complex with Ap4A tends to support the stereo-chemical evidence that phosphoryl transfer in this enzyme is direct during the kinase reaction .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crystallization and data collection
The recombinant TdcD was overexpressed and purified as described earlier .7 Briefly , TdcD from Salmonella typhi-murium was cloned in pRSET C vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS along with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag . 
The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography . 
The protein -- ligand complexes were prepared by incubating 10 mg/mL of the purified enzyme with the ligand in the molar ratio of 1:50 at 48C for at least 6 h . 
The ligands ( ATP or Ap4A ) used for crystallization were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. . 
Crystallization experiments were carried out by the hanging drop vapor-diffu-sion as well as microbatch methods . 
A 1:1 mixture of silicone oil and mineral oil was used to control the rate of equilibration in the microbatch method . 
In the hanging drop method , crystals of TdcD in the presence of ATP and Ap4A were obtained in 0.1 M Bis-Tris ( pH 6.5 ) , 17 % ( w/v ) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000 and in 0.1 M Bis-Tris ( pH 6.5 ) , 45 % ( v/v ) pentaerythritol ethoxylate 
( 15/4 EO/OH ) , 100 mM ammonium sulfate , respectively . 
Crystals of native TdcD were obtained by the microbatch method in 0.1 M Bis-Tris ( pH 6.5 ) , 30 % ( v/v ) pentaeryth-ritol ethoxylate ( 15/4 EO/OH ) . 
Diffraction data for native TdcD and Ap4A complex were collected at 100 K to resolutions of 2.6 and 2.4 Å , respectively , with 20 % ( v/v ) EDO as a cryoprotectant using a MAR345 imaging plate detector system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 X-ray generator equipped with a 300 çm focal cup . 
A complete data set to a resolution of 2.0 Å was collected on a TdcD crystal obtained in the presence of ATP on beamline BL26B1 at SPring-8 , Hyogo , Japan . 
All the three datasets belonged to the space group P3121 and had similar unit cell dimensions . 
The volume of the asymmetric unit of the crystals was compatible with only one subunit , with a Matthews coefficient of 2.7 Å Da and a calculated solvent content 3 -- 1 of 53.2 % ( v/v ) .8 The data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK of the HKL suite .9 
Structure determination and refinement
Structures of native TdcD and its complex with ATP and Ap4A were determined using the atomic coordinates of protein atoms from a monomer of TdcD-ADP structure2 by difference Fourier analysis . 
A randomly chosen subset of 5 % of the reflections was reserved for the calculation of Rfree . 
The 2Fo -- Fc map calculated after initial restrained refinement using REFMAC510 showed good fit for the majority of the main chain . 
This was followed by model building and restrained refinement using COOT11 and REFMAC5 ,10 until R and Rfree converged . 
Ambiguities in the model were resolved by setting the occupancies of the atoms concerned to zero until the density could be interpreted clearly . 
In the final stages of refinement , inspection of difference electron density maps of complexes showed strong positive density for the ligand in the active site pocket . 
In the TdcD dataset obtained in the presence of ATP , difference Fourier computed at this stage showed continuous density beyond g-phosphate of ATP . 
Careful examination of this extra electron density suggested that the density fits a molecule of diadenosine tetraphosphate ( Ap4A ) very well . 
In the TdcD-Ap4A dataset , difference Fourier clearly revealed Ap4A bound to the polypeptide in the active site pocket . 
To eliminate effects of phase bias originating from the starting model , simulated annealed Fo -- Fc omit maps were calculated using the program CNS_solve1 .1 with the ligand removed from the model .12,13 The density at the active site of omit map could be unambiguously interpreted as a Ap4A molecule . 
Electron density corresponding to EDO was observed near the active site pocket of TdcD structures . 
Addition of ligand was followed by identification of potential sites of solvent molecules by automatic waterpicking algorithm of COOT .11 The positions of these automatically picked waters were manually checked and a few more waters were manually identified . 
Addition of ligand and water molecules to the model resulted in further 
decrease in R and Rfree . 
Structure analysis
The geometry of the final model was checked using PROCHECK .14 Structural superpositions and the rmsd calculations between the subunits of TdcD were done using the program ALIGN .15 Average B-factors for protein atoms , water molecules and ligands were calculated using the BAVERAGE program of the CCP4 suite .16 Interactions were evaluated using the CONTACT program of the CCP4 suite .16 A cut-off distance of 4.0 Å was used to identify the residues interacting with the ligand . 
Electrostatic surface representations for TdcD-Ap4A was prepared using the program GRASP17 and rest of the figures were prepared using the program PyMOL .18 
Mass spectroscopic analysis
For mass spectroscopic analysis , the purified enzyme was incubated with 10 mM ATP ( disodium salt ) in the presence of 100 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 , 10 mM magnesium chloride and 1 mM DTT . 
This reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 12 h and was analyzed with a MALDI-TOF-MS instrument ( Ultraflex TOF/TOF , Bruker Daltonics ) equipped with a pulsed N2 laser ( k 5 337 nm ) . 
The reaction mixture was mixed with matrix ( 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 1:1 ( v/v ) water/acetonitrile mixtures ) in the ratio of 1:1 ( v/v ) and 1.0 lL of this mixture was spotted onto the matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization ( MALDI ) sample stage . 
It was then analyzed in the reflectron mode using a 90-ns time delay , and a 25-kV accelerating voltage in the positive ion mode . 
Two hundred shots were averaged to obtain the spectrum . 
Protein data bank accession numbers
The coordinates and structure factors for TdcD-native , TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) and TdcD-Ap4A have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank and assigned accession codes 2E1Y , 2E1Z , and 2E20 , respectively . 
RESULTS
Structure determination and model quality
Efforts to obtain crystals of unliganded TdcD were successful using microbatch method after repeated trials . 
The structures of native TdcD and its complexes were determined using the atomic coordinates of protein atoms of TdcD-ADP complex as the model .2 Surprisingly , in the structure of TdcD obtained in the presence of ATP , a blob of continuous electron density was present beyond the g-phosphate of fitted ATP . 
Careful examination of extra electron density suggested that it corresponds to diadenosine tetraphosphate ( Ap4A ) . 
Ap4A fitted very well into the electron density and could be successfully refined . 
However , mass spectrometric analysis of the ATP used for coc-rystallization did not show presence of Ap4A or ADP . 
This suggested that TdcD has a novel Ap4A synthetic activity . 
To confirm the ability of Ap4A to bind into the active site pocket of TdcD , structure of TdcD was solved in the presence of commercially available Ap4A . 
The electron density of Ap4A in both TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) and TdcD-Ap4A were nearly identical and allowed unambiguous determination of orientation and conformation of Ap4A . 
The simulated annealed Fo -- Fc omit maps for Ap4A calculated using the program CNS_solve1 .112 is shown in the Figure 1 .

Presence of ammonium sulphate in the crystallization cocktail led to very poor ligand density in the active site pocket in the datasets of TdcD obtained in the presence of ATP . 
Only in the absence of ammonium sulphate in the crystallization condition , TdcD dataset obtained in the presence of ATP showed good electron density for the Ap4A . 
Presence or absence of ammonium sulfate during cocrystallization of TdcD with Ap4A did not show any such effect on the electron density of Ap4A . 
Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the presence of ammonium sulphate in the crystallization cocktail interferes with the binding of ATP to the enzyme . 
Unlike TdcD-AMPPNP structure , EDO used as the cryoprotectant during data collection binds away from propionate binding site in the TdcD structures complexed with Ap4A . 
Mg 21 used in the crystallization experiment could not be located in the model which suggests that divalent ions are not required for the binding of nucleotides to the enzyme . 
The structures of TdcD-native ( 2.6 Å ) , TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) ( 2.0 Å ) , and TdcD-Ap4A ( 2.4 Å ) have been determined with good stereo-chemical parameters . 
In all the three structures , the electron density is of good quality for the major part of the polypeptide chain , except in the residue ranges 39 -- 42 and 49 -- 58 , where poor density is observed . 
Besides the N-terminal His tag , initial three residues at the N-terminus and final five residues at the C-terminus were not included in the model because of the absence of well-defined electron density . 
The structures have 89 -- 90 % of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran map calculated with the program PROCHECK .14 The crystal parameters and data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

Structures of TdcD and its complex with Ap4A
Superposition of Ca atoms of native TdcD and its complexes with Ap4A ( ATP ) , Ap4A , ADP , and AMPPNP on each other using the program ALIGN15 gave rms deviations ranging from 0.15 to 0.33 Å , indicating that there are no major main-chain alterations between these structures . 
The conformation of most of the residues in TdcD-native is similar to the conformation of corresponding residues in structures of TdcD obtained with various nucleotides . 
However , significant conformational differences were observed in Gly205 , Asn206 , and Gly207 . 
These residues occur in the turn between the first and second b-strands of the C-terminal domain . 
Previously , we have shown that these residues are flexible and play an important role in the binding of nucleotides .2 In the absence of the nucleotide , backbone atoms of these three residues and the side chain of Asn206 move towards the site for the phosphate , in the direction of His175 and His203 . 
In the native structure , the side chain oxygen atom of Asn206 forms a hydrogen bond with the mainchain nitrogen atom of His175 . 
Examination of relative positions of N - and C-terminal domains in TdcD and its complexes did not reveal evidence for domain motion which is expected to occur during catalysis . 
However , high B-factors and relatively poorer electron density for the residues away from the hinge region between the domains is indicative of plausible domain motion in TdcD similar to that observed in the other members of ASKHA superfamily . 
Ap4A binding
The electrostatic surface potential representation of the enzyme with Ap4A bound at the active site pocket is shown in Figure 2 . 
Ap4A extends from the nucleotide binding site to the propionate binding site . 
The adeno-sines present in the nucleotide and propionate binding sites are designated as A and B , respectively . 
The binding modes of Ap4A in the active site of TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) and TdcD-Ap4A structures are almost identical [ Fig. 3 ( a ) ] . 
Unlike TdcD-AMPPNP structure , where EDO is present in the propionate binding site , presence of adenine B displaces the EDO towards the phosphate groups in TdcD-Ap4A structure . 
Figure 3 ( b ) shows the interactions ( 4 Å ) of Ap4A with water molecules and amino acid residues in TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) structure . 
Hydrogen bonds formed by Ap4A in TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) and in the TdcD-Ap4A structures are listed in Table II . 
Most of the hydrogen bonds except those with water molecules are common to TdcD-Ap4A and TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) structures . 
Some of these water molecules are absent in TdcD-Ap4A structure , perhaps because of its lower resolution . 
Both the adenine rings are in the anti conformation with respect to the ribose sugars , which are in the C2 0-endo form . 
The adenosine A shows stronger electron density compared with adenosine B probably as a result of tighter binding .

Adenosine A
In TdcD-Ap4A , adenosine A interactions are similar to those of TdcD-ADP and TdcD-AMPPNP . 
The adenine A is present in a pocket formed by residues Leu279 , 
Arg280 , Glu283 , Gly326 , Asn330 , and Ser331 . 
It is sandwiched between side chain of Arg280 and Asn330 . 
No ar-omatic residue is sufficiently close to stack with the base . 
There are no direct hydrogen bonds between the base and the protein atoms , suggesting low specificity of the enzyme towards nucleotide bases . 
Only AN7 atom of the adenine ring makes a hydrogen bond with a water mole-cule . 
The AO2 * of ribose A is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atoms of carboxyl group of Asp278 and the main chain N of Leu279 whereas AO3 * and AO4 * of ribose A are hydrogen bonded to the main chain N of Leu279 and Ile327 , respectively . 
a , b , c , and d phosphates 
The four phosphates of Ap4A make several hydrogen bonds with protein atoms . 
The a-phosphate forms three hydrogen bonds , one each with the main chain N of Asn206 , Gly326 and with side chain ND2 of Asn206 . 
It also forms one hydrogen bond with a water molecule present nearby . 
The b-phosphate is poorly connected

Hyphens indicate missing hydrogen bonds . 
EDO , ethylene glycol ; HOH , water . 
with the enzyme and forms only one hydrogen bond with the ND2 of Asn206 . 
All the three oxygen atoms of g-phosphate are hydrogen bonded to the protein atoms or water molecules . 
Two hydrogen bonds are formed with water molecules and three more are with main chain atoms of Asn206 , Gly207 and NE2 of His203 . 
The d-phosphate forms two hydrogen bonds , one with the NE2 of His175 and another with the oxygen atom of EDO . 
Adenosine B
The ribose B forms five hydrogen bonds , three with water molecules and one each with ND2 of Asn11 pres-ent in the N-terminal domain and O1 of EDO . 
The adenine B is situated in a pocket formed by Ala88 , His118 , Phe174 , Pro227 , Arg236 , and EDO . 
In acetate kinase , ace-tate binds in the pocket formed by these amino acids . 
Hence , propionate in TdcD is expected to bind in this pocket . 
His118 forms stacking interactions with the adenine B . 
The base forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain atom of conserved His118 and Arg236 . 
It also forms three hydrogen bonds with water molecules in TdcD-Ap4A ( ATP ) and two hydrogen bonds in TdcD-Ap4A model . 
A less bulky residue glycine and a more bulky group valine is present in all butyrate and acetate kinases , respectively , at a position equivalent to Ala88 , present at the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket in propionate kinase . 
The size of this hydrophobic pocket has been shown to be a determinant of substrate specificity in acetate , propionate , and butyrate kinases .2,19 Only two other protein structures in the Protein Data Bank have Ap4A bound as a ligand . 
In human adenylate kinase 2 , Ap4A is present in a folded conformation with two phosphates and one adenosine in alternate conformations ( PDB code 2C9Y ; unpublished result ) . 
In the structure of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in complex 20 with Ap4A , the second adenosine moiety is disordered . 
Thus , TdcD complexed with Ap4A is the first structure with Ap4A in an extended conformation .

Formation of Ap4A by TdcD
Further experiments were carried out to confirm the formation of Ap4A by propionate kinase in the presence of ATP . 
Purified recombinant enzyme was incubated with ATP in the presence of Mg . 
After incubation , the reac-21 tion mixture was analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometric analysis . 
The spectrum showed the presence of ADP ( MW 427.20 ) , ATP ( MW 507.18 ) , and Ap4A ( MW 836.39 ) in 1 H ion form ( mass-to-charge ( m/z ) 427.784 , 507.827 , and 837.103 ) and as Na adducts ( m/z 529.834 and 1 859.103 ) ( Fig. 4 ) confirming the presence of Ap4A synthetic activity of TdcD . 
DISCUSSION
Ap4A is found in the cytosol of all prokaryotes and eukaryotes in concentrations ranging from 0.05 lM to approximately 10 lM .21 There are a few specific enzymes which preferentially use Ap A as the substrate .22 -- 24 In 4 higher eukaryotes , there is a Ap A hydrolase ( EC 4 3.6.1.17 ) which asymmetrically hydrolyzes Ap A to ATP 4 and AMP . 
In prokaryotes , there is another Ap A hydro-4 lase ( EC 3.6.1.17 ) which symmetrically hydrolyzes Ap A 4 to two molecules of ADP . 
Most other lower eukaryotes examined so far have a distinct enzyme , a reversible Ap4A phosphorylase ( EC 2.7.7.53 ) , which catalyses the reaction Ap4A 1 Pi $ ATP 1 ADP . 
In yeast , the presence of two such Ap4A phosphorylases ( I and II ) has been reported . 
Later , similar activity was also found in the extracts of two protozoans , various green algae and in cyanobacteria .22 However , Ap4A phosphorolytic activity has not been detected in prokaryotes so far . 
The Ap4A synthetic activity of Ap4A phosphorylase could explain the formation of Ap4A by TdcD in the presence of ATP . 
In the case of TdcD , initially ATP might undergo hydrolysis to yield ADP , which could in turn react with excess ATP present in the crystallization mixture leading to the formation of Ap4A in the presence of Mg . 
21 Structure of adenylate kinase complexed with the dia-denosine pentaphosphate ( Ap5A ) mimicking the two substrates ( ATP and AMP ) , has allowed construction of a stabilized transition state , which supports the view that these kinases mediate direct transfer of phosphoryl groups from ATP to acceptors rather than by a double displacement mechanism .25 Similarly , presence of Ap4A in the active site pocket of TdcD mimicking both the substrates ( either propionyl phosphate and ADP or propionate and ATP ) is suggestive of direct in-line transfer mechanism . 
Further , the direct in-line transfer mechanism is also supported by stereochemical evidence and steady state kinetics .4,6,26 In S. typhimurium , Ap4A and several other related dinucleotides have been shown to rapidly accumulate in response to a bacteriostatic quinine ACDQ ( 6-amino-7-chloro-5 ,8 - dioxoquinonoline ) and during heat shock or exposure to ethanol .27,28 It was proposed that these dinucleotides may be alarmones , alerting the cells to the onset of oxidation stress .29 In vitro studies have suggested that the following enzymes may be responsible for the formation of the adenine-containing NpnNs in vivo : certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ,30 Ap4A phosphoryl-ase ,31 firefly luciferase ,32 acyl-CoA synthetase ,33 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ,34 DNA ligases ,35,36 RNA ligase ,37 nonribosomal peptide synthetase ,38 and cou-marate-CoA synthetase .39 Studies involving Ap4A have indicated its role in cell proliferation , DNA replication , DNA repair , cardiovascular system , neurotransmission , and apoptosis .24,40 -- 44 Following the early discovery by Zamecnik et al. ,30 that Ap4A is generated as a by-product by aminoacyl t-RNA synthetases , there has been considerable interest in the possible role of Ap4A inside the cell . 
Considering its role in various metabolic processes , diadenosine poly-phosphates and their synthetic analogues are being evaluated for their potential as pharmacological agents . 
Since induced expression of enzymes involved in the anaerobic breakdown of L-threonine takes place in the absence of glucose and oxygen in the medium during which energy level inside the cell is low , formation of Ap4A and its binding to TdcD could be of additional interest in view of its proposed role as a metabolic regulator . 
The present work provides a new direction to investigate several unanswered questions regarding the formation of Ap4A by TdcD and its roles in the metabolic process .
