The ﬁm operon of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes type 1 ﬁmbriae . 
The expression of ﬁm is controlled in response to environmental signals through a complex regulatory cascade involving the proteins FimW , FimY , and FimZ and a genetic locus , ﬁmU , that encodes a rare arginine tRNA . 
We discovered that a knockout mutation in lrp , the gene that codes for the leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) , inhibited ﬁm transcription . 
The loss of ﬁm gene expression was accompanied by a corresponding loss of the mannose-sensitive hemagglutination that is a characteristic of type 1 ﬁmbriae . 
Normal type 1 ﬁmbrial expression was restored following the introduction into the knockout mutant of a plasmid carrying a functional copy of the lrp gene . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed no interactions between puriﬁed Lrp protein and the regulatory region of the ﬁmA , ﬁmU , or ﬁmW gene . 
Instead , Lrp produced protein-DNA complexes with the regulatory region of the ﬁmZ gene , and the nature of these complexes was leucine sensitive . 
DNase I footprinting showed that Lrp binds within a region between 65 and 170 with respect to the ﬁmZ transcription start site , consistent with the binding and wrapping of the DNA in this upstream region . 
Ectopic expression of the ﬁmZ gene from an inducible promoter caused Lrp-independent type 1 ﬁmbriation in serovar Typhimurium . 
These data show that Lrp makes a positive contribution to ﬁm gene expression through direct interaction with the ﬁmZ promoter region , possibly by antagonizing the binding of the H-NS global repressor protein . 
Type 1 ﬁmbriae were the ﬁrst bacterial ﬁmbriae to be described ( 13 , 30 , 31 ) , and most members of the Enterobacteria-ceae express them ( 2 , 3 , 22 , 35 , 44 , 47 ) . 
These proteinaceous appendages are arranged peritrichously on the cell surface , where they facilitate bacterial adhesion to a variety of eukaryotic cells through interactions with mannosylated glycoproteins ( 50 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses 13 putative ﬁmbrial operons ( 10 , 33 , 42 , 48 , 56 ) . 
One of these is ﬁm , the operon encoding type 1 ﬁmbriae . 
The ﬁm genes are expressed in vitro in serovar Typhimurium cultures grown statically in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth and in bacteria growing in vivo in ligated bovine ileal loops ( 42 ) . 
However , they are not expressed by bacteria growing on Luria agar plates under standard laboratory growth conditions ( 49 ) . 
Thus , type 1 ﬁmbriae are subject to environmental regulation , and they have been described as having an on-off phase-variable expression pattern ( 73 ) . 
They are also contributors to bacterial virulence in a number of hosts ( 4 , 5 , 8 , 32 , 53 , 71 ) . 
The mechanism of phase-variable ﬁm gene expression in serovar Typhimurium differs substantially from that in Esche-richia coli , which has by far the best-characterized type 1 ﬁmbrial gene regulatory system . 
In E. coli , the inversion of a DNA element known as ﬁmS is mediated by a site-speciﬁc recombination mechanism that alternatively connects and disconnects

the ﬁmA structural gene to and from its promoter ( 1 , 34 ) . 
In serovar Typhimurium , ﬁm gene expression is not regulated through the reversible inversion of a cis-acting regulatory DNA motif . 
Instead , control is exerted through a cluster of four regulatory genes , ﬁmU , ﬁmW , ﬁmY , and ﬁmZ , located downstream of the main ﬁm structural operon ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Transcriptional control of the structural genes is achieved primarily through the regulation of the ﬁmA gene promoter . 
The FimZ transcription factor activates this promoter directly , and it also positively regulates the transcription of its own gene , ﬁmZ ( Fig. 1 ) ( 82 ) . 
The FimZ protein is an `` orphan '' member of the response regulator family of transcription factors , that is , one for whom no cognate histidine protein kinase partner has been identiﬁed ( 83 , 84 ) . 
The FimY protein is an essential coregulator that cooperates with FimZ in activating the ﬁmA promoter through a mechanism that does not involve a direct interaction between FimY and ﬁmA ( 72 ) . 
A third regulatory protein , FimW , exerts a negative effect on ﬁmA expression through a FimW-FimZ pro-tein-protein interaction that is inhibitory toward the positive inﬂuence of the FimZ protein ( 74 ) . 
Posttranscriptional control is a feature of both the serovar Typhimurium and E. coli ﬁm operons . 
In serovar Typhi-murium , the ﬁmU gene speciﬁes a rare arginine tRNA that modulates the translation of the mRNA expressed by the ﬁmY regulatory gene ( 73 ) . 
In E. coli , a detachable Rho-dependent transcription terminator modulates the rate of turnover of an mRNA expressed by one key regulatory gene ( 40 , 45 ) while a rare leucine tRNA encoded by the leuX gene inﬂuences the rate of translation of another ( 65 ) . 
Mutations in the serovar 
60 
Typhimurium ﬁmU locus inhibit ﬁmY translation and lead to an aﬁmbriate phenotype ( 73 ) . 
The leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) is an 18.8-kDa DNA binding protein that acts globally to inﬂuence transcription and other DNA transactions ( 12 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 26 , 43 , 55 , 59 , 69 , 81 ) . 
Its activity can be enhanced , attenuated , or unaffected by L-leucine in different Lrp-dependent systems . 
Leucine also inﬂuences the oligomeric structure of the protein , with the formation of octamers being favored when it is present ( 19 , 21 , 62 ) . 
Lrp is known to regulate many ﬁmbrial genes , and its contributions have been studied in considerable detail in the cases of the E. coli pap and ﬁm systems . 
In the E. coli ﬁm system , it serves to modulate the efﬁciency of the site-speciﬁc recombination reaction that inverts the cis-acting ﬁmS regulatory element ( 6 , 46 , 66 ) ; in the pap system , it impedes the methylation of key regulatory sequences by the DNA adenine methylase ( Dam ) protein ( 11 , 39 , 76 ) . 
In both cases , Lrp directly inﬂuences the phase-variable expression of these E. coli ﬁmbrial structural genes . 
The pef genes on the pSLT virulence plasmid in serovar Typhimurium encode Pef pili and are regulated by a mechanism that is strikingly similar to that found in the E. coli pap system ( 60 ) . 
Pef ﬁmbriae are expressed in vitro only in static cultures growing in rich media at acid pHs ( 5 ) . 
The on-off pef switch is controlled by the differential meth-ylation of 5 - GATC-3 sites in pef regulatory DNA by Dam . 
Dam competes with Lrp for access to these sites ( 60 ) , although the distribution of high - and lower-afﬁnity sites within the pef regulatory region is thought to differ from that in pap ( 39 ) . 
Dam-Lrp competition has also been described in the cases of pili encoded by daa ( F1845 pili ) , fae ( K88 pili ) , and sfa ( S pili ) from E. coli ( 39 ) . 
We aimed to discover whether Lrp could inﬂuence type 1 ﬁmbrial gene expression in serovar Typhimurium ; here , we report a role for Lrp as a positive regulator of the serovar Typhimurium ﬁm genes and present details of the regulatory mechanism . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Growth media and conditions . 
Strains were routinely grown in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm or on LB agar . 
The expression of ﬁmbriae in the cultures was induced by aerobic passage in static broth at 37 °C for 48 to 72 h. Motility was examined using swarm plates as described previously ( 46 ) . 
To analyze pBADﬁmZ functionality , 0.2 % glucose or 0.2 % arabinose was incorporated into the swarm agar . 
Bacterial strains and plasmids . 
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
The lrp knockout mutant was complemented using plasmid pKMC102 . 
This plasmid was made by amplifying the lrp gene from strain SL1344 by PCR using primer pair fwd1 .3 and rev1 .3 ( Table 2 ) . 
The resulting amplicon was digested with AatII . 
The single-copy-number plasmid pZC320 was digested with PmlI and AatII and ligated with the lrp gene-containing fragment . 
The ﬁmZ gene was placed under the control of the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter . 
First , the open reading frame of the ﬁmZ gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the primer pair ﬁmZ-BAD_F and ﬁmZ-BAD_R-H and the resulting amplicon was digested with NcoI . 
Both the linearized vector and the ﬁmZ DNA fragment were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to create blunt ends . 
Digestion with HindIII was used to facilitate the insertion and ligation of the ﬁmZ gene into pBAD24 in the appropriate orientation for transcription from the PBAD promoter . 
The plasmid pBSKﬁmZ that was used for DNase I footprinting and DNA sequencing was generated by PCR with primer pair ﬁmZ300_F . 
BamHI and ﬁmZ300_R . 
EcoRI , followed by cloning into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II SK ( ) . 
Construction of the lrp mutant of SL1344 . 
CJD3130 , the lrp mutant derivative of SL1344 ( Table 1 ) , was constructed by cloning the lrp gene plus ﬂanking regions into the low-copy-number plasmid vector pCL1921 using primer pair fwd1 .3 _ EcoRI and rev1 .3 _ PstI ( Table 2 ) . 
The BamHI fragment of pHP45 - Km , containing an - ﬂanked kanamycin cassette , was ligated into a BglII site located 29 bp into the coding region of the cloned lrp gene . 
The disrupted gene was PCR ampliﬁed using primer pair fwd1 .3 and rev1 .3 , digested with DpnI , and using pKOBEGA as described previously ( 17 ) , transduced into the strain LT2 . 
The disrupted gene was retransduced into SL1344 using P22 . 
The structure of the insertion mutation was conﬁrmed by PCR and by Southern blotting ( 67 ) . 
SL1344 and the isogenic lrp mutant of SL1344 were analyzed for growth in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking ( 250 rpm ) . 
A typical growth curve showed a slight growth defect of the lrp mutant : SL1344 showed a mean doubling time of 28 min , while the SL1344 lrp mutant displayed a mean doubling time of 30 min . 
RT-PCR . 
RNA was isolated from cultures using the SV total RNA isolation kit ( Promega ) . 
The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at A260 . 
Reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) was carried out with the OneStep RT-PCR kit ( QIAGEN ) using sample RNA at 0.6 g l 1 and the oligonucle-otides listed in Table 2 . 
The primer melting temperature was calculated to be 52 °C , and the number of cycles was set to 24 . 
Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis in 1 % agarose -- Tris-acetate-EDTA . 
Densitometry was performed using the Quantity One program ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Mannose-sensitive-hemagglutination assay . 
Agglutination tests were performed by incubating 50 - l aliquots of bacterial cultures with equal optical densities at 600 nm with 50 - l samples of 6 % guinea pig erythrocytes . 
Mannose sensitivity was shown by a failure to agglutinate following the incorporation of D-mannose at a ﬁnal concentration of 3 % ( wt/vol ) . 
Lrp protein puriﬁcation . 
The lrp gene was ampliﬁed from SL1344 genomic DNA using primer pair forNdeI-lrp and revXhoI-lrp ( Table 2 ) , incorporating NdeI and XhoI restriction sites . 
The amplicon was cloned into pET22b , the IPTG ( isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ) - inducible protein expression plasmid , to produce pKMC301 , which expresses Lrp with a C-terminal His tag . 
Lrp protein expression was induced and the protein was puriﬁed as described previously ( 46 ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . 
DNA probes were ampliﬁed using biotinylated primers for the region of interest ( Table 2 ) and were subse quently puriﬁed by gel electrophoresis . 
Aliquots of approximately 50 pg of biotinylated DNA probes were incubated with binding buffer for 5 min at room temperature as described previously ( 15 ) . 
Increasing concentrations of Lrp protein were added , and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature . 
Protein-DNA complexes were formed in a reaction volume of 20 l , including L-leucine where applicable . 
Ten-microliter samples of the protein-DNA mixtures , plus loading dye , were subjected to electrophoresis at 100 V on Novex 6 % DNA retardation gels ( Invitrogen ) at room temperature . 
Gels were transferred onto membrane using the Novex XCell II blot module ( Invitrogen ) , UV cross-linked , and developed using the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module ( Pierce ) . 
DNase I footprinting . 
DNase I footprinting was carried out as previously described ( 75 ) . 
The probes used for DNase I footprinting were generated by PCR using primer pair ﬁmZ300_F . 
BamHI and T7_for or ﬁmZ300_R . 
EcoRI and T7_rev ( Table 2 ) . 
The sequences complementary to the T7 oligonucleotides are located outside the multiple cloning site of pBluescript . 
T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to label the DNA probes at both ends with [ -32 P ] ATP , and the probes were then digested to remove the label from one end , depending on the strand to be analyzed . 
Lrp protein-DNA binding reactions used for DNase I footprinting were identical to those used for EMSA analysis , except that these reactions were performed in 50 - l volumes . 
DNA sequencing reactions using dideoxy chain terminators were performed as previously described ( 75 ) by using the T4 DNA sequencing kit ( USB ) and appropriate sequencing primers . 
The products of the DNase I footprinting and the DNA sequencing reactions were resolved by electrophoresis through a 6 % urea-polyacrylamide gel .

RESULTS
Expression of ﬁm genes is strongly reduced in an SL1344 lrp mutant . 
Lrp is known to regulate the ﬁmbrial genes of a number of bacterial species ( 11 , 60 , 76 ) , including the ﬁm genes encoding the type 1 ﬁmbriae of E. coli ( 6 , 46 , 66 ) . 
In this study , we examined the effect of an lrp knockout mutation on type 1 ﬁmbriation in serovar Typhimurium . 
A characteristic of type 1 ﬁmbriae is their ability to bind to a mannosylated glycoprotein , laminin , on the surfaces of erythrocytes . 
The serovar Typhi-murium strain used in this study , SL1344 , strongly agglutinates erythrocytes ( Fig. 2 ) . 
We constructed an SL1344 lrp knockout mutant and investigated whether it displayed altered levels of type 1 ﬁmbriation . 
Hemagglutination assays were performed in the presence and absence of D-mannose . 
SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp mutant , and the SL1344 lrp mutant complemented with pKMC102 ( lrp ) were incubated with guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence or absence of D-mannose , as described in Materials and Methods . 
The lrp mutant displayed no visible agglutination activity ( Fig. 2 ) . 
As expected , the wild-type strain and the complemented lrp mutant showed obvious agglutination in the absence of mannose and this hemagglutination was inhibited in the presence of mannose ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Lrp regulates type 1 ﬁmbrial genes in E. coli by participating in a DNA inversion event that is mediated by site-speciﬁc recombination . 
However , the serovar Typhimurium ﬁm gene cluster does not possess an invertible DNA switch . 
Since Lrp operates as a transcription factor at promoters throughout the genome ( 43 ) , its ability to inﬂuence the transcription of genes within the serovar Typhimurium ﬁm gene cluster was assessed by RT-PCR . 
The genes tested were the structural genes ﬁmA , ﬁmF , and ﬁmH and the regulatory genes ﬁmW , ﬁmY , and ﬁmZ . 
RNA for RT-PCR analysis was extracted from SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp mutant , and the SL1344 lrp mutant complemented with pKMC102 ( lrp ) at the stationary phase of growth in LB broth cultures . 
The results obtained showed that the transcript levels of the ﬁmA and ﬁmZ genes were reduced dramatically in the lrp mutant , by approximately 5 - and 10-fold , respectively , compared to those in the wild type and the complemented mutant ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The levels of transcripts of ﬁmH ( encoding the ﬁmbrial adhesin ) , ﬁmF ( encoding a putative ﬁmbrial protein ) , and ﬁmY ( a positive regulator ) were down-regulated by 2 - , 1.4 - , and 2-fold , respectively , in the lrp mutant . 
Importantly , ﬁmW , a negative regulator of ﬁmbrial expression , did not show a signiﬁcant difference in transcript level in the lrp mutant compared to the wild type or the complemented mutant ( Fig. 3A ) . 
This result showed that the negative effect associated wit the loss of lrp gene expression was not shared among all the genes in the ﬁm cluster . 
The RNA used in this experiment was isolated from bacteria grown under incubation conditions that were suboptimal for ﬁmbriation . 
We therefore used RNA isolated from cultures that had been grown under conditions that were ideal for the expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae ( see Materials and Methods ) and analyzed the transcript levels expressed by the major ﬁmbrial subunit gene ( ﬁmA ) and the three essential regulatory genes ( ﬁmW , ﬁmY , and ﬁmZ ) by RT-PCR . 
This analysis showed that both the ﬁmA and ﬁmZ genes had decreased transcript levels in the lrp mutant ( approximately threefold lower than those in the wild type ) whereas their expression in the complemented mutant showed no difference compared to that in the wild type ( Fig. 3B ) . 
In addition , the presence of the lrp mutation had no effect on either the ﬁmW or the ﬁmY transcripts . 
Taken together , these RT-PCR data suggested that Lrp had a positive role in controlling the transcription of the ﬁmA and ﬁmZ genes .

FIG. 3 . 
Effect of an lrp knockout mutation on transcription within the ﬁm gene cluster . 
Reverse transcription-PCR assays were used to monitor ﬁm gene transcription in wild-type SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp knockout mutant ( SL1344 lrp ) , and the complemented SL1344 lrp knockout mutant that harbors pKMC102 , a plasmid expressing functional Lrp protein [ SL1344 lrp ( pKMC102 ) ] . 
Results are presented for bacteria grown to stationary phase ( A ) or grown under conditions that stimulate ﬁmbriation ( B ) . 
The intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry and expressed relative to the value for SL1344 . 
The experiment was performed on two separate occasions , with similar results 
FIG. 4 . 
Detection of Lrp-DNA interactions within the ﬁm gene cluster by EMSA . 
( A ) DNA fragments from the regulatory regions of the ﬁmA , ﬁmW-ﬁmU , and ﬁmZ genes were incubated with increasing concentrations of puriﬁed Lrp protein in the presence or absence of L-leucine . 
Ge 
Lrp binds to the ﬁmZ promoter region in vitro . 
To determine whether the effect of Lrp was direct or indirect , the interactions of this protein with the promoter regions of ﬁmA and ﬁmZ and with the ﬁmW-ﬁmU intergenic region were analyzed by EMSA . 
The ﬁmA fragment was 699 bp in length ( extending from 425 to 274 with respect to the transcription start site [ 84 ] ) . 
The ﬁmW-ﬁmU intergenic region is 294 bp in length and extends from position 35 in the ﬁmW open reading frame to a location that is 5 bp upstream of the start point of the ﬁmU tRNA . 
These EMSA analyses showed no direct interaction of Lrp either with the promoter region of ﬁmA or with ﬁmW-ﬁmU , either in the presence or in the absence of leucine ( Fig. 4A , panel 1 and 2 ) . 
The promoter region of ﬁmZ was also examined for Lrp binding . 
The ﬁmZ transcriptional start site is located 227 bp upstream of the ﬁmZ start codon ( 84 ) . 
When a 372-bp region encompassing the ﬁmZ transcriptional start site ( 1 ) plus 125 bp upstream ( fragment I ) was incubated with increasing concentrations of Lrp , no interaction was seen ( Fig. 4A , panel 3 ) . 
However , when this region was extended to 291 bp upstream of the ﬁmZ transcriptional start site ( fragment II ) , an interaction with Lrp was demonstrated ( Fig. 4A , panel 4 ) . 
This interaction did not appear to be modulated by leucine . 
The region of Lrp binding to ﬁmZ was characterized in more detail by EMSA in combination with a deletion analysis using nested probes , as shown in Fig. 4B . 
The far-upstream probe Z103 did not show an interaction at 53 , 133 , or 266 nM Lrp , in either the presence ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or the absence ( lanes 5 to 7 ) of 15 mM leucine ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Probe Z202 ( 291 to 90 ) formed three complexes , and extending the length of the probe to encompass the DNA from 291 to 8 did not result in the formation of additional complexes ( Fig. 4C ) . 
This ﬁnding showed that the region important for the interaction of Lrp with the ﬁmZ promoter is located between 90 and 190 with respect to the ﬁmZ transcription start site ( 84 ) , a region encompassed by probe Z202 ( Fig. 4B ) . 
Three complexes with Z202 were observed , suggesting that Lrp binds to up to three sites within this region ( Fig. 4C ) . 
In the absence of leucine ( Fig. 4C , middle panel , lanes 2 to 6 ) , complexes 1 and 2 predominated at Lrp concentrations in the range from 27 to 53 nM ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , with increasing formation of complex 3 at Lrp concentrations in the range from 27 to 266 nM ( lanes 3 to 6 ) . 
The addition of leucine altered the relative concentrations of the three complexes , but no new complexes were seen ( lanes 7 to 11 ) . 
This result suggested that leucine inﬂuenced the distribution of Lrp across the sites . 
DNase I footprinting analysis of Lrp binding at the ﬁmZ promoter . 
A DNase I protection assay was used to analyze in more detail the nature of the interaction of Lrp with the ﬁmZ regulatory region and the effect of leucine on this interaction . 
Both the coding ( Fig. 5A ) and the noncoding ( Fig. 5B ) strands of the ﬁmZ regulatory region were examined , both in the absence and in the presence of leucine . 
This analysis was done with a DNA fragment extending from positions 300 to 17 of ﬁmZ , which was approximately equivalent to probe Z299 ( Fig. 4B ) . 
The regions of protection and hypersensitivity are summarized in Fig. 5C . 
Lrp protected a 90-bp region on the coding strand , between approximately 85 and 170 with respect to the transcriptional start site ( 1 ) , from DNase I digestion ( Fig. 5A ) . 
In addition , periodic hypersensitive regions , which are indicative of the bending of DNA and characteristic of Lrp , were detected at positions 71 , 84 , 112 , 113 , 144 , 145 , and 157 . 
This ﬁnding suggested that Lrp had bent and/or wrapped the DNA to form a nucleoprotein complex . 
The hypersensitive reaction at position 71 was seen only in the presence of leucine , as was a small region of DNase I protection extending from 70 to 65 . 
DNase I footprinting of the top , noncoding strand of the ﬁmZ regulatory region revealed a pattern of protection by Lrp that was strikingly similar to that seen on the coding strand ( Fig. 5B and C ) . 
These data correlated with those from the EMSA analysis ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Hypersensitive bases were also visible on the noncoding strand , at positions equivalent to those on the coding strand . 
Ectopic expression of FimZ restores ﬁmbriation in an SL1344 lrp mutant . 
To examine whether the positive regulatory effect of Lrp on ﬁmZ is required for the expression of ﬁmbriae , an arabinose-inducible , glucose-repressible ﬁmZ expression plasmid , pBADﬁmZ , was constructed ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
The wild-type strain SL1344 was transformed with plasmids pBADﬁmZ and pBAD24 , the vector control . 
The pBADﬁmZ construct was tested for its functionality by inoculation onto swarm plates including 0.2 % arabinose or 0.2 % glucose . 
The overexpression of FimZ has been shown previously to inhibit motility by the down-regulation of the ﬂhDC master regulatory genes , which activate ﬂagellar expression ( 23 ) . 
As expected , only the SL1344 ( pBADﬁmZ ) construct displayed inhibition of motility in the presence of arabinose , which was consistent with the expression of functional FimZ protein from pBADﬁmZ . 
The expression of ﬁmbriae by SL1344 wild-type and SL1344 lrp mutant strains containing pBADﬁmZ was induced as described in Materials and Methods . 
SL1344 ( pBADﬁmZ ) showed similar levels of hemagglutination in the presence of arabinose and glucose ( Fig. 6 ) . 
The pBADﬁmZ-containing lrp mutant showed no visible agglutination of red blood cells in the presence of glucose , which inhibited the expression of FimZ from this construct . 
In the presence of 0.2 % arabinose , which induced the PBAD promoter , the SL1344 lrp mutant showed agglutination of red blood cells at levels that were comparable to those seen with the wild-type strain SL1344 . 
In all cases , this agglutination was demonstrated to be mannose sensitive ( Fig. 6 ) . 
electrophoresis was used to detect changes in the mobility of the labeled DNA fragments caused by the formation of Lrp-DNA complexes . 
A complex ( C1 ) was detected only in the case of the 538-bp ﬁmZ DNA fragment II ( panel A4 ) . 
A nonspeciﬁc band ( X ) was detected in all lanes of panel A4 , whether Lrp protein was present or not . 
( B ) The origin of the 538-bp ﬁmZ DNA fragment is depicted in panel B , together with that of the 372-bp ﬁmZ fragment I used for panel A3 and the shorter ﬁmZ regulatory region fragments Z103 , Z202 , and Z299 used in the experiments with results shown in panel C. ( C ) The 103-bp Z103 ﬁmZ fragment did not form a complex with Lrp , while both the Z202 and Z299 fragments did . 
Probe Z202 ( 291 to 90 ) formed three complexes ( arrows ) , and increasing the length of the probe to include the DNA from 291 to 8 ( Z299 ) did not result in the formation of additional complexes : at least two ( arrows ) were detectable with the Z299 probe . 
Taken together , the data showed that the Lrp interaction with ﬁmZ DNA occurred within the region bounded by the dashed box in panel B that was common to Z202 and Z299

Detection of Lrp interactions with the ﬁmZ regulatory region by DNase I protection assay . 
( A and B ) Lrp protein binding to the coding ( A ) and noncoding ( B ) strands of the regulatory region of the ﬁmZ gene was detected by DNase I footprinting . 
Puriﬁed Lrp protein was added to ﬁmZ regulatory region DNA at the indicated concentrations in the presence or absence of L-leucine , as indicated above each lane . 
DNA sequencing reactions were run in the lanes labeled A , C , G , and T for the coding ( A ) and noncoding ( B ) DNA strands . 
Vertical dashed lines show approximately those regions where Lrp protein has protected the DNA from DNase I digestion , while arrowheads indicate bases that show hypersensitivity to the enzyme . 
( C ) A summary of the data from panels A and B is shown in panel C. Bases in the ﬁmZ regulatory-sequence DNA are numbered with reference to the transcription start site ( 1 ) , and the numbers correspond to those shown next to the DNA sequencing reaction results in panels A and B. Dashed horizontal lines indicate approximately the regions that are protected by Lrp , and arrowheads show bases displaying hypersensitivity to DNase I in the presence of Lrp . 
Filled circles between the DNA strands show the positions of the numbered coordinates . 
The sequences showing homology to the consensus sequence for Lrp binding sites are in boldface type and are underlined and labeled sites I , II , and III . 
The boxed motifs are possible binding sites for RNA polymerase located around positions 10 and 35

Ectopic expression of the FimZ regulatory protein reverses the effect of the lrp mutation on mannose-sensitive hemagglutination . 
Hemagglutination assays were carried out with variants of strain SL1344 and the SL1344 lrp mutant containing the ﬁmZ gene under the control of the arabinose-inducible and glucose-repressible PBAD promoter in recombinant plasmid pBADﬁmZ ( SL1344 pBADﬁmZ and SL1344 lrp pBADﬁmZ , respectively ) . 
Equivalent numbers of bacterial cells were mixed with red blood cells ( RBCs ) in the absence or presence of 3 % ( wt/vol ) D-mannose . 
DISCUSSION
This study establishes that the leucine-responsive regulatory protein , Lrp , plays a positive role in controlling the expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae in serovar Typhimurium . 
The same protein is a regulator of type 1 ﬁmbrial gene expression in E. coli , but it acts there through a completely different mechanism . 
The role of Lrp in regulating the E. coli ﬁm genes is intimately linked to the site-speciﬁc recombination mechanism that inverts the 314-bp ﬁm DNA switch that harbors the promoter for the transcription of the ﬁm structural genes ( 6 , 66 ) . 
Lrp binds within this invertible DNA element but does not inﬂuence transcription from the ﬁmA promoter ( 29 ) . 
Instead , it acts as an architectural element within the ﬁm invertasome and contributes to the distinguishing of the on and off forms of the switch at the level of the nucleoprotein complex ( 46 , 66 ) . 
The serovar Typhimurium ﬁm genes are not controlled by a DNA inversion mechanism but rely instead on a complicated regulatory cascade involving at least four regulatory genes ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Our data have identiﬁed a role for the Lrp protein acting directly at the ﬁmZ regulatory gene . 
The inactivation of the lrp gene by mutation results in a loss of mannose-sensitive hem-agglutination that is consistent with a failure to express type 1 ﬁmbriae ( Fig. 2 ) , which is accompanied by a reduction of at least threefold in ﬁmA and ﬁmZ transcription ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Both hemagglutination and ﬁmA and ﬁmZ transcription are restored in the lrp knockout mutant following the introduction of a recombinant plasmid that contains a functional copy of the lrp gene ( Fig. 2 and 3 ) . 
The expression of the ﬁmH gene was not as strongly affected as that of the other ﬁm genes by the lrp mutation ( Fig. 3A ) . 
This ﬁnding raises the possibility that the 
FimH adhesin was still present , albeit in highly truncated ﬁmbriae . 
If this was so , the adhesin had little ability to agglutinate red blood cells . 
We used a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I protection assays to locate the Lrp binding site ( s ) at the ﬁmZ gene ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . 
Although a search was made using bioinformatic methods and EMSA , we found no evidence for Lrp binding in the promoter region of the ﬁmA , ﬁmU , or ﬁmW gene ( Fig. 4 ) . 
All our results indicate that Lrp exerts its positive effect on type 1 ﬁmbriation in serovar Typhimurium through the modulation of ﬁmZ regulatory gene transcription . 
The EMSA data suggest that Lrp forms three complexes upstream of the ﬁmZ promoter and that this interaction is modulated by L-leucine ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . 
Although Lrp can form high-afﬁnity nonspeciﬁc complexes with DNA , these complexes are not usually inﬂuenced by leucine ( 62 ) . 
The DNase I protection studies permitted the identiﬁcation of regions upstream of ﬁmZ that became hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in the presence of the Lrp protein . 
Lrp likely binds among those hypersensitive regions , bending the DNA between its binding sites and opening the DNA duplex there to enhanced DNase I digestion , as has been described in previous Lrp studies ( 79 , 80 ) . 
These ﬁndings , along with data from the EMSA analysis , suggest that there are three binding sites for Lrp amid the hypersensitive bases in the protected region . 
These regions were examined for sequences with similarity to the Lrp consensus sequence YAGHAWATTWTDCTR ( 24 , 25 , 63 ) . 
Three sites ( Fig. 5C ) show mismatches of three , four , and ﬁve bases compared to the consensus sequence . 
Site I , centered at 100 and having a mismatch of ﬁve bases , is located in the region covered by ﬁmZ probe I ( Fig. 4B ) , which did not show any interaction with Lrp in the EMSA . 
It is tempting to hypothesize that Lrp binding at site I may require cooperative binding to sites II and III , centered at 129 and 152 , respectively , and that complex 3 , seen in the EMSA analysis with probe Z202 , indicates the occupation of this site . 
Certainly , the cooperative binding of DNA is a recurring theme in studies of Lrp ( 20 , 36 , 37 , 62 , 63 ) . 
Puriﬁed Lrp protein protects bases in the regions extending from approximately 85 to 119 , 121 to 140 , and 146 to 170 on both strands from DNase I digestion in vitro ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Each of these regions of protection contains a match to the consensus sequence for Lrp binding sites ( Fig. 5C ) . 
The presence of the Lrp protein results in hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion in the case of certain bases on both the coding and noncoding strands . 
This elevated sensitivity is known to be consistent with the wrapping of the DNA around the protein , which results in the exposure of speciﬁc bases to enhanced DNase I cleavage ( 61 , 77 ) . 
The EMSA data suggest that leucine inﬂuences the cooperativeness of Lrp binding to ﬁmZ DNA ( Fig. 4 ) . 
However , the pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity seen in the ﬁmZ regulatory region was independent of leucine except in the region from 65 to 71 ( Fig. 5 ) . 
This result suggests that once puriﬁed Lrp protein has bound to its target sequences , leucine has only a modest inﬂuence on the protein-DNA interaction . 
However , the EMSA data indicate that leucine can also inﬂu-ence Lrp-DNA interaction further upstream , within the sequences encompassed by probe Z202 ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Thus , leucin does have an inﬂuence on Lrp-ﬁmZ interaction , but it is a subtle one that requires further study . 
The ectopic expression of the ﬁmZ regulatory gene from plasmid pBADﬁmZ made the expression of mannose-sensitive hemagglutination independent of the lrp gene . 
This result provides strong evidence that ﬁmZ is the primary point at which the Lrp protein interacts with the ﬁm gene cluster . 
It is also completely consistent with data from EMSA and DNase I footprinting experiments that show physical interaction of the Lrp protein with the ﬁmZ regulatory region . 
The Lrp binding sites identiﬁed in the ﬁmZ regulatory region are located far upstream from the transcription start site . 
The closest is centered at position 100 , making it unlikely that the positive effect of Lrp on ﬁmZ transcription involves direct protein-protein interaction with RNA polymerase unless the intervening DNA is looped . 
FimZ is known to regulate the expression of its own gene positively , raising the possibility that Lrp can potentiate the positive effect of FimZ at the PﬁmZ promoter . 
A 7-bp sequence ( 5 - AATAAGA-3 ) that is known to be required for FimZ binding at ﬁmA is centered at position 352 upstream of ﬁmZ ( 84 ) . 
Binding at this far-upstream location may mean that FimZ interaction with RNA polymer-ase requires the intervening DNA to be bent by the Lrp protein . 
Certainly , the relative locations of the putative FimZ binding site at 352 and the Lrp sites at 152 and 100 are consistent with such a model . 
Another attractive mechanism involves the Lrp-mediated ( or Lrp - and FimZ-mediated ) remodeling of the ﬁmZ promoter region to displace a transcriptional repressor . 
The H-NS protein is a global repressor of transcription in gram-negative bacteria , and it has high afﬁnity for A T-rich DNA sequences ( 9 , 27 , 28 , 54 , 58 , 64 , 70 ) . 
The ﬁmZ gene is unusually A T rich , and two independent chromatin immu-noprecipitation studies have shown that the H-NS protein binds to it ( 54 , 57 ) . 
Moreover , the inactivation of the hns gene resulted in the up-regulation of ﬁmZ transcription by 17-fold in a previous transcriptomic experiment ( 57 ) . 
Our ﬁnding ( Fig. 2 ) that Lrp can activate ﬁmZ transcription by at least 10-fold under growth conditions comparable to those used in the H-NS transcriptomic experiments is consistent with the hypothesis that Lrp derepresses ﬁmZ by the displacement of H-NS . 
In light of the positive regulation of ﬁmZ by the FimZ protein , H-NS displacement could be achieved by Lrp alone or by Lrp acting in combination with FimZ . 
This type of antirepression mechanism is a common theme in studies of H-NS-mediated negative regulation of transcription , and it is becoming clear that a wide variety of DNA binding proteins are capable of dislodging the repressor ( 18 , 52 , 75 , 78 ) . 
The involvement of the global regulators Lrp and H-NS in addition to the ﬁm-speciﬁc proteins FimW , FimY , and FimZ is likely to make the ﬁm gene cluster sensitive to environmental stimuli and to the physiological state of the cell . 
In the future , it will be important to discover what role , if any , these factors play in the phase variation of serovar Typhi-murium type 1 ﬁmbriae .
