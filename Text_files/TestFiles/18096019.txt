In vitro mimicking of the stimuli controlling in vivo-inducible bacterial promoters during infection of the host can be complex . 
Therefore , the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was evaluated , as a surrogate host to examine the expression of Salmonella enterica promoters . 
Green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP1 ) was put under the control of the promoters of the pagC , mgtB , sseA , pgtE and fur genes of S. enterica . 
After infection of C. elegans with an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing these constructs , clear bacterial expression of GFP1 was observed under the control of all ﬁve promoters , although signiﬁcant expression was not always obtained in vitro . 
It is concluded that C. elegans constitutes a useful model system for the study of the in vivo expression of Salmonella promoters .

Introduction
Live-attenuated Salmonella strains are promising vaccine carriers that can induce an effective immune response against foreign antigens ( Mastroeni et al. , 2001 ) . 
Various strategies have been developed for the stable and efﬁcient expression of these heterologous antigens . 
One of the most desirable may be to use an in vivo-inducible promoter . 
Ideally , this promoter is activated only when the bacteria enter the host or even when they interact with immune cells . 
This allows the culture and administration of recombinant bacteria that express low levels of antigen , resulting in minimal interference with bacterial viability or genetic stability ( Dunstan et al. , 1999 ; Mastroeni et al. , 2001 ) . 
Generation of the correct stimuli to induce these promoters in vitro can , however , be complex , which may complicate the development of suitable vaccine strains . 
Elucidating the induction mechanism of in vivo-inducible bacterial promoters can moreover be helpful for understanding the interaction between pathogens and their host . 
A better knowledge of the pathogenesis may lead to the development of improved prevention strategies or 
The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful surrogate host to study bacterial pathogens , such as Salmonella enterica serovars . 
These bacteria can persistently infect the intestine of C. elegans and reduce its lifespan ( Aballay et al. , 2000 ; Aballay & Ausubel , 2001 ) . 
Several Salmonella genes needed for virulence in vertebrates also play a role during infection of C. elegans ( Aballay et al. , 2000 ; Labrousse et al. , 2000 ; Tenor et al. , 2004 ) , and mutant strains that exhibit a reduced virulence in mammals were also attenuated in the nematode ( Labrousse et al. , 2000 ; Tenor et al. , 2004 ) . 
An additional advantage of using C. elegans as a model system is the transparency of these animals , allowing the use of ﬂuo-rescent proteins as reporter genes in situ ( Chalﬁe et al. , 1994 ) . 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the nematode C. elegans as a model system for the analysis of in vivo-inducible Salmonella promoters . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and nematodes
Escherichia coli K514 ( Colson et al. , 1965 ) was used for all cloning procedures . 
Wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar 
treatments . 
Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) LT2 strain w3000 ( Gulig & Curtiss , 1987 ) was used for the preparation of total DNA . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DV6181 , a live-attenuated vaccine strain , carrying deﬁned deletions of the guaB , ﬂiC and ﬂjBA genes ( Adriaensen , 2006 ) , was used for infection of C. elegans . 
For cloning , bacteria were grown at 37 1C on Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) agar plates or in LB broth , supplemented with carbenicillin ( 100 mgL ) or kanamycin 1 ( 50 mgL ) when required . 
1 Caenorhabditis elegans strain N2 , provided by the Cae-norhabditis Genetics Center ( University of Minnesota ) , was used in all the experiments . 
The nematodes were propagated on Nematode growth medium ( NGM ) with E. coli strain OP50 as a food source and were handled using standard procedures ( Brenner , 1974 ) .

Plasmids used in this study 
Plasmid Description
pDONRP4-P1R Donor vector used to clone the promoter elements pDONR221 Donor vector used to clone the gfp1 gene trogen ) . 
The plasmids and primers utilized in this work are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . 
The DNA fragment encoding green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP1 ) ( Scholz et al. , 2000 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR from plasmid pEHEC356 , using primers attB1-gfp and attB2-gfp . 
The resulting PCR fragment was inserted into plasmid pDONR221 , by site-speciﬁc BP recombination , between the bacterial attachment sites attB ﬂanking the PCR fragment and the l-phage attachment sites attP present on pDONR221 . 
This gave rise to plasmid pGV5174 . 
A fragment containing the pagC promoter ( position 12141 -- 12838 of accession number AE008754 ) was obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium w3000 , using primers PagCFW and PagCRev and inserted into pDONRP4-P1 . 
A third PCR fragment , containing a streptomycin and spectinomycin ( Sm/Sp ) resistance gene , was ampliﬁed from pGV1113 , using primers StrepFW and StrepRev , and inserted into the plasmid pDONRP2R-P3 , giving rise to plasmid pGV5194 . 
The inserts of the three donor vectors were subsequently combined into the destination vector pDESTR4-R3 by a site-speciﬁc LR recombination . 
The resulting plasmid ( pGV5178 ) contains the gfp1 gene under the control of the pagC promoter , followed by the Sm/Sp gene . 
The same strategy was followed to place gfp1 under the control of other promoters . 
The fur ( position 1558 -- 1851 of accession number AE008728 ) , sseA ( position 9459 -- 9855 of accession number AE008761 ) , pgtE ( position 1064 of 1218 accession number AE008808 ) and mgtB ( position 11367 -- 11581 of accession number AE008875 ) promoter sequences were ampliﬁed by PCR from the genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium w3000 , respectively , with primer sets , FurFW and FurRev , SseAFW and SseARev , PgtEFW and PgtERev or MgtBFW and MgtBRev and inserted into the plasmid pDONR221 . 
Site-speciﬁc LR recombination of the inserts of these donor vectors and the inserts of pGV5292 and pGV5291 into the destination vector pDESTR4-R3 resulted in plasmids pGV5221 , pGV5217 , pGV5222 and pGV5220 . 
These plasmids were transferred to S. Typhimu-rium DV6181 by electroporation . 
GFP1 ﬂuorescence in the colonies growing on LB medium was observed using a Philips TL 6W/08 F6 T5/BLB lamp .

In vitro expression of GFP
GFP expression was measured in a Cytoﬂuor II ﬂuores-TM cence multi-well plate reader ( PerSeptive Biosystems ) , using lex 485 nm and lem 530 nm , and is expressed in arbitrary units ( a.u. ) relative to DV6181 ( pEHEC356 ) . 
Bacteria containing gfp1 under the control of the PpagC were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.01 M MgSO4 or 6 mM EGTA ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) . 
For the PpgtE and PmgtB promoters , N-minimal medium ( Nelson & Kennedy , 1971 ) containing 8 mM MgCl2 ( low Mg21 ) or 10 mM MgCl2 ( high Mg ) and 0.3 mM guanine was compared . 
The expression 21 of PsseA was tested in LB medium and Phosphate Carbon Nitrogen minimal medium with phosphate limitation ( PCN-P ) ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) , containing 0.3 mM guanine . 
For Pfur , LB medium was used . 
As LB medium is autoﬂuor-escent , cultures grown in LB medium were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline , before detection of ﬂuorescence . 
DV6181 with or without pEHEC356 were included , respectively , as negative and positive controls . 
Samples of bacterial cultures were taken at different time points ( before induction and after 1 , 2 , 3 h or overnight induction ) and adjusted to an OD660 nm of 0.6 before ﬂuorescence measurements . 
Infection and microscopic observation of nematodes
Lawns of S. Typhimurium DV6181 derivatives , containing the relevant plasmids , were cultured overnight on 9 cm Petri dishes containing NGM medium , avoiding a 2 cm area on one side of the plates . 
Five microliters of droplets of concentrated commercial bleach and 2 M NaOH were mixed in the bacteria-free area , and ﬁve nematodes containing mature eggs were immediately transferred into this mixture . 
This resulted in killing of the adult nematodes and the E. coli OP50 , while the hatching larvae survived and fed on the lawn of Salmonella . 
After 4 days , living nematodes were transferred into a 10 mL droplet of 20 mM NaN3 on a thin layer of 3 % agarose in M9 buffer ( Brenner , 1974 ) on a slide and covered with a cover slip . 
The immobilized nematodes were examined using a Carl Zeiss Axiophot ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with the E-GFP ﬁlter set . 
Photography was performed using a Nikon Coolpix990 digital camera . 
The brightness and contrast were adjusted in Microsoft Ofﬁce PowerPoint 2003 .

Results and discussion
Construction of the promoter-gfp fusions
The DNA fragment encoding GFP1 was ampliﬁed by PCR and placed under the control of different in vivo-inducible promoters , using the MultiSite Gateway technology . 
The s pagC promoter was chosen , because the expression of different antigens driven by this promoter can elicit a strong immune response in mice ( Dunstan et al. , 1999 ; Bumann , 2001 ; Chen & Schifferli , 2003 ) . 
The mgtB ( Tao et al. , 1995 ) , sseA ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) and pgtE ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) promoters are sensitive to changes in the extracellular environment and may thus be useful for building stable vaccine constructs . 
Fur plays an important role in the virulence of Salmonella , regulating several virulence-asso-ciated promoters ( Tsolis et al. , 1995 ) . 
Pfuris highly expressed in Salmonella infecting the host and was therefore included in the study as a positive control . 
In vitro expression of GFP
In vitro expression of GFP1 in S. Typhimurium DV6181 was conﬁrmed by observing the ﬂuorescence of the cells grown on different media . 
On LB plates , S. Typhimurium DV6181 ( pGV5221 ) colonies , which harbor GFP1 under the control of the P promoter , showed clear green fur ﬂuorescence when examined under UV light ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DV6181 - ( pGV5178 ) colonies , which harbor GFP1 under the control of the PpagC promoter , showed weak , but clearly detectable green ﬂuorescence ( Fig. 1a ) . 
To compare the level of GFP1 expression under inducing and noninducing conditions , bacteria were grown in different liquid media . 
The background ﬂuorescence of DV6181 was low ( 2 a.u. ) , and high levels ( set to 100 a.u. ) of ﬂuorescence were detected using DV6181 ( pEHEC356 ) , which expresses GFP1 under the control of the lac promoter . 
Fluorescence levels of these strains were used as , respectively , negative and positive controls . 
The expression of GFP1 , controlled by the PpagC promoter , was already above the background level of DV6181 ( 2 a.u. ) , when DV6181 - ( pGV5178 ) was grown under noninducing conditions using LB medium supplemented with MgSO4 ( 17 a.u ) . 
However , GFP1 expression still increased after induction in LB medium containing EGTA , increasing from 23 a.u. after 1 h of induction to 43 and 66 a.u. after , respectively , 2 and 3 h , ﬁnally reaching a fourfold increase in ﬂuorescence ( 72 a.u. ) after overnight induction . 
Expression driven by the PsseA in LB medium ( 13 a.u. ) was slightly above the background ﬂuorescence of DV6181 , and a sharp increase ( to 234 a.u. ) was observed after the growth of DV6181 ( pGV5217 ) in PCN-P medium . 
Here again , the increase in ﬂuorescence was correlated to the induction time , with longer induction ( 2 and 3 h ) resulting in higher ﬂuorescence levels ( respectively , 88 and 169 a.u. ) . 
Pfur is highly active in LB medium ( 327 a.u. ) . 
Because the regulation of Pfur is complex ( Ratle-dge & Dover , 2000 ) , and expression in LB medium was already very high , ﬂuorescence levels were only considered-after overnight growth and other inducing media were not tested for this promoter . 
The ﬂuorescence of DV6181 harboring gfp1 under the control of PmgtB or PpgtE , grown under noninducing conditions in N-minimal medium containing high Mg concentrations , respectively , 2 and 4 a.u. 21 was comparable to DV6181 ( 2 a.u. ) . 
After induction using low Mg concentrations , only a barely noticeable increase 21 in ﬂuorescence was measured , to respectively 3 and 6 a.u. , regardless of the time point considered . 
The mgtB promoter is regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system and should respond to changes of the Mg con-21 centration in the medium ( Tao et al. , 1995 , 1998 ; Vescovi et al. , 1997 ) . 
The expression of pgtE in the presence of PhoP / Q-inducing N-minimal medium with a low Mg concen-21 tration was shown in some studies ( Kukkonen et al. , 2004 ) , although Guina et al. ( 2000 ) reported that the PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system does not account for the regulation of transcription or transport of pgtE , but plays a role in its post-transcriptional regulation . 
Transcription of pgtE is also induced in Salmonella cells isolated from macrophages ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) . 
Most likely , the conditions required for sufﬁcient induction of the PpgtE and PmgtB were not reached , using the media that were tested . 
This illustrates the problems encountered when trying to mimic in vitro the stimuli controlling in vivo-inducible bacterial promoters during infection of the host . 
In vivo expression of the promoter-GFP fusions 
In vivo induction of the promoters was tested in the nematode C. elegans . 
Nematodes holding eggs were bleached on NGM plates containing a layer of S. Typhimurium DV6181 transformed with plasmids pGV5178 , pGV5221 , pGV5217 , pGV5222 or pGV5220 . 
Before infection , the expression of GFP1 in the bacteria , grown on NGM plates , was checked . 
Only DV6181 ( pGV5221 ) showed clear green ﬂuorescence when examined under UV light ( Fig. 1b ) . 
After 4 days , the progeny of the nematodes was examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy . 
The experiment was performed twice to ascertain reproducibility . 
The results presented in Fig. 2 show that all tested promoters are active when S. Typhimurium is present in the intestine of C. elegans . 
The ﬂuorescence observed in the intestine of nematodes fed on DV6181 ( pGV5221 ) , shown in Fig. 1e , is , however , not limited to colonizing bacteria present in the intestine , but is observed uniformly in the entire digestive tract . 
This is most likely caused by the destruction of bacteria , expressing GFP1 before infection , in the grinder located in the terminal bulb of the pharynx of the nematodes ( Albertson 
& Thomson , 1976 ) , releasing the strongly ﬂuorescent GFP1 protein into the digestive tract . 
Quantiﬁcation of the promoter activity in the nematodes by determining the ﬂuorescence relative to the amount of bacteria present in the nematode 's intestine was not successful due to the low number of bacteria recovered from the nematode 's intestine and the background of the ﬂuorescence measurements in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader . 
Therefore , the high discriminative power of the ﬂuorescence microscope , allowing in situ visualization of GFP expression in individual bacterial cells , was required for these experiments . 
In conclusion , the results demonstrated that the nematode C. elegans may constitute a useful model system for the study of in vivo-inducible Salmonella promoters .
