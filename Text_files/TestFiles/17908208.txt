S. enterica ompS1 and ompS2 genes that code for the OmpS1 and OmpS2 quiescent porins that belong to the OmpC/OmpF superfamily ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 1995 ; 2004 ; Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
OmpS1 appears to have a role in swarming motility , bioﬁlm formation and virulence in mice ( Toguchi et al. , 2000 ; Mireles et al. , 2001 ; Rodríguez-Morales et al. , 2006 ) . 
Expression of ompS1 is dependent on two overlapping promoters , P1 and P2 . 
The P1 promoter is dependent on the OmpR response regulator : the ompS1 upstream regulatory region possesses six OmpR binding sites . 
The P2 promoter does not require OmpR for activation and is only active in the absence of OmpR . 
The regulatory region between positions -310 to +27 with respect to the transcriptional start site of P1 contains both positive and negative regulatory elements . 
Sequences upstream of position -88 are required for negative regulation and sequences downstream of -88 are required for positive regulation ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
H-NS , a nucleoid protein of 137 amino acids ( ~ 15 kDa ) , negatively regulates ompS1 expression by binding upstream of position -88 ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
In Salmonella , H-NS has been proposed to selectively silence horizontally acquired genes by targeting sequences with GC content lower than the resident genome , regulating around 12 % of its genes ( Lucchini et al. , 2006 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ) . 
E. coli and other related enteric bacteria such as S. enterica contain StpA , an H-NS paralogue ( Shi and Bennett , 1994 ; Zhang et al. , 1996 ; Bertin et al. , 2001 ; Tendeng and Bertin , 2003 ; Madrid et al. , 2007 ) . 
StpA binds both to RNA and DNA , and also shows preference for curved DNA sequences ( Zhang et al. , 1996 ; Sonnenﬁeld et al. , 2001 ) . 
Analysis of stpA and hns expression has indicated that the two gene products are capable of both negative autogenous control and cross-regulation ; that is , StpA levels are signiﬁcantly increased in an hns mutant background . 
Because of the high level of amino acid sequence identity between H-NS and StpA ( 58 % ) , it has been proposed that StpA is a molecular back-up for H-NS ( Shi and Bennett , 1994 ; Sondén and Uhlin , 1996 ; Zhang et al. , 1996 ; Sonnenﬁeld et al. , 2001 ) . 
LeuO is a LysR-type quiescent regulator that is under negative control by H-NS ( Klauck et al. , 1997 ; Chen et al. , 
B
2005 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ) . 
It has been implicated in the bacterial response to stress ( VanBogelen et al. , 1996 ; Fang et al. , 2000 ; Majumder et al. , 2001 ) , in virulence ( Tenor et al. , 2004 ; Lawley et al. , 2006 ; RodríguezMorales et al. , 2006 ) and in bioﬁlm accumulation ( Moorthy and Watnick , 2005 ) . 
Furthermore , expression of LeuO has been found to affect the expression of several genes inﬂuenced by mutations in hns : LeuO relieved silencing of the bgl operon , the operon involved in the utilization of certain b-glucosides ( Ueguchi et al. , 1998 ) ; suppressed the effect of an hns mutation on cadC , which codes for the activator of the acid-inducible lysine decarboxylase ( Shi and Bennet , 1995 ) ; and also suppressed the negative effect of the AT4 region , the 72 bp gene silencer region located between the leuO gene and the leuABCD leucine biosynthetic operon , by delimiting the transcriptional repression by H-NS through the binding of LeuO to the promoter region ( Chen et al. , 2001 ; 2003 ) . 
Besides , LeuO has a negative effect on the expression of the small regulatory DsrA RNA that increases sigma factor RpoS translation ( Klauck et al. , 1997 ) . 
It has been reported more recently that LeuO positively regulates the expression of rovA , which codes for the key regulator of virulence in Yersinia ( Lawrenz and Miller , 2007 ) . 
Interestingly , we had shown previously that LeuO positively regulates ompS2 ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
We report here that LeuO and the silencing proteins H-NS and StpA are the main positive and negative regulators of ompS1 expression in Salmonella . 
LeuO positively regulated the ompS1 expression by derepressing both promoters and antagonizing the negative effect of H-NS and StpA , displacing them from the 5 ′ regulatory region . 
In this study , LeuO was found to bind upstream and not to interact with the ompS1 promoter region . 
Results
LeuO positively regulated ompS1 expression in Salmonella enterica
We have reported previously that LeuO positively regulates ompS2 expression in S. Typhi ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
To test whether LeuO regulated the ompS1 gene , LeuO was expressed in S. Typhi wild type from plasmid pFMTrcleuO-50 induced with a gradient of IPTG concentrations ( 0 -- 100 mM ) , and the effect was determined on the expression of S. Typhi ompS1 -- lacZ ( pRO310 ) and ompS2 -- lacZ ( pFM413 ) gene reporter fusions ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Interestingly , the pRO310 ompS1 -- lacZ fusion was also positively regulated by LeuO , but at higher concentrations of IPTG than previously reported for ompS2 . 
The highest level of ompS1 expression 
( ~ 25 000 U ) was obtained when LeuO was induced at 100 mM IPTG . 
It is interesting that at the highest levels of LeuO induction ompS1 expression increased whereas ompS2 expression decreased . 
In contrast , the level observed for ompS1 expression was constant at the higher concentrations of IPTG up to 1 mM ( data not shown ) . 
Expression of pRO310 and pFM413 is also shown in the original S. Typhi Tn-10 insertion mutant ( IMSSTN103 ) , where the transposon insertion promoted leuO expression and allowed us to identify LeuO as a positive regulator of ompS2 ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
As observed , ompS1 expression was not induced as compared with the wild type , and only ompS2 expression could be readily detected albeit at a relatively low level . 
OmpS1 could now be detected as an OMP in the S. Typhi wild type , upon induction with LeuO from pFMTrcleuO-50 at 50 and 100 mM IPTG ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The identity of the OmpS1 band in the DompS2 ( STYS241 ) mutant strain was veriﬁed by mass spectrometry analysis . 
Hence , LeuO regulated positively the ompS1 gene . 
LeuO derepressed both ompS1 promoters
To elucidate how LeuO , OmpR and H-NS regulate ompS1 expression , the effect of LeuO was evaluated in the wild type ( IMSS-1 ) , in the ompR mutant ( IMSS-41 ) , in the hns mutant ( STYhns99 ) and in the hns ompR double mutant ( STY9941 ) . 
The STYhns99 mutant was obtained upon random mutagenesis of the S. Typhi genome , in the search for ompS1-negative effectors ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
The expression value levels for ompS1 at 100 mM IPTG in the wild type were ~ 25 000 U ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This maximum level of expression is as observed for the pRO88 fusion that lacks the cis-negative regulatory elements ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
In the ompR mutant the expression was induced to ~ 12 000 U ( Fig. 2A ) , indicating the importance of OmpR in order to reach the maximum level of ompS1 expression . 
Furthermore , expression in the hns mutant derivatives increased in the presence of LeuO , indicating that it can derepress ompS1 expression to the maximum level . 
In the hns ompR double mutant , the levels of expression were half of those observed in the hns single mutant upon induction of LeuO ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Because of the fact that ompS1 has two promoters , primer extension experiments were performed in order to assess the effect of LeuO on each promoter from the chromosomal gene . 
When LeuO was induced in the wild type , expression was observed only from P1 ; whereas in the ompR mutant the expression came from P2 ( Fig. 2B ) . 
This further illustrates how OmpR differentially regulates both promoters ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; FloresValdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
Figure 2C depicts the presence of OmpS1 in the outer membrane upon induction with LeuO , even in the ompR mutant ( under P2 ) . 
It is thus evident that OmpR is required only for the highest levels of expression , and that it determines the use of the promoters thus acting as a modulator of the ompS1 expression ; and that LeuO is the main regulator by derepressing both P1 and P2 . 
StpA repressed ompS1 expression in a mutant hns background
H-NS negatively regulates ompS1 expression in both S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
Moreover , the pattern of S. Typhi ompS1 regulation is similar in S. enterica and in E. coli ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
However , as the expression of the ompS1 -- lacZ pRO310 fusion was still partially repressed in a Salmonella hns mutant ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ; Fig. 2A ) , the possibility of StpA also acting as a repressor was explored as StpA is increased in a mutant hns background ( Sondén and Uhlin , 1996 ; Zhang et al. , 1996 ; Sonnenﬁeld et al. , 2001 ) . 
Given that null mutations in hns are lethal in S. enterica unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in rpoS or phoP ( Navarre et al. , 2006 ) , and as we were unable to generate a double hns stpA mutant in S. enterica , the effect of H-NS and StpA in S. Typhi was assessed using a dominant negative system that codes for an H-NS protein with a mutation in the C-terminal domain ( G113D ) ( Ueguchi et al. , 1996 ) . 
This mutant is defective in the ability to repress transcription but not in the ability to interact with other H-NS monomers . 
The negative dominant allele was cloned in a pMPM-T6W vector that is inducible by arabinose ( pT6-HNS-G113D ) ( Bustamante et al. , unpubl . 
data ) . 
We tested two ompS1 fusions , pKFV310 and pKFV88 , being equivalent to pRO88 and pRO310 , respectively , but with the appropriate antibiotic resistance marker ( pROs and pT6-HNS-G113D are Tcr ) . 
The ompS1 expression was determined under the induction of pT6H-NSG113D in three S. Typhi backgrounds : wild type ( IMSS-1 ) , hns mutant ( STYhns99 ) and stpA mutant ( STY DstpA ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
In the wild type , the induction of pT6-HNS-G113D resulted in the derepression of ompS1 expression , 
A
B
reaching the levels of an hns mutant ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The induction of pT6H-NS-G113D had no signiﬁcant effect on ompS1 expression in the hns background but , interestingly , in the stpA background the levels of ompS1 expression were maximum being similar to the pKFV88 fusion that lacks the negative regulatory elements ( Fig. 3A ) . 
These observations were corroborated determining the presence of OmpS1 in the outer membrane , coded by the S. Typhi chromosomal gene , expressed upon induction of the negative dominant allele . 
OmpS1 was detected in the wild type and in the hns background , and in the stpA mutant it was very abundant as expected ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Our results indicate that indeed H-NS and StpA silence ompS1 expression in S. Typhi , where StpA represses only in an hns background . 
H-NS , StpA and LeuO bound around OmpR box IV H-NS was found to bind upstream of position -88 of ompS1 P1 ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
To determine more precisely the site for H-NS binding , several fragments from the S. Typhi ompS1 regulatory region were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ; Fig. 4A , Table 1 ) and subjected to an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . 
Each fragment was evaluated using as negative control , the ler-coding region of enteropatho-genic E. coli and as positive control , the ompS1 regulatory region ( F1 ) ; both controls previously had been characterized by Flores-Valdez et al. ( 2003 ) , as exempliﬁed in caused a diminished affinity to H-NS , showing their relevance for efficient binding ( Fig. 4C ) , as illustrated by F2 as compared with F3 . 
On the other hand , the binding to fragments F6 and F7 and not to F8 indicated a second binding site at -59 to -25 ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
In terms of StpA , it bound to the same DNA fragments , but at twofold to threefold higher concentrations than H-NS ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
As the presence of both sites was needed for H-NS and StpA interaction , i.e. there was no binding to fragments F4 nor F8 that lack one of the two sites , we postulate that both of them are required for proper DNA binding ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
DNase footprinting was performed to determine the binding of H-NS to the ompS1 regulatory region in the vicinity of OmpR-binding box IV ( -70 to -200 bp upstream 
E
of the P1 transcriptional start ) . 
As can be observed , H-NS bound indeed around OmpR-binding box IV at 0.2 and 0.4 mM ( Fig. 4D ) corroborating the data generated by EMSA ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Upstream and downstream sequences of OmpR-binding box IV were protected at higher H-NS concentrations ( 0.6 -- 1.0 mM ) . 
LeuO also bound downstream of -153 as shown by the binding to F1 and not to F5 ( Fig. 4A and E ) . 
Furthermore , it bound to F2 , F3 , but not to F4 , indicating that it also 
F
bound between positions -164 and -114 ( Fig. 4A and E ) . 
No other region for LeuO binding was detected as for H-NS and StpA ( not shown ) . 
The binding site for LeuO was further deﬁned by a DNase footprinting analysis between positions -137 and -96 ( Fig. 4F ) . 
Speciﬁcally , LeuO bound at a region with two sites : one between -134 and -125 , LeuO ( I ) , and another at -113 to -99 , LeuO ( II ) , where the ﬁrst site generated greater protection by LeuO than the second ( Fig. 4F ) . 
As can be appreciated , the contact points for LeuO overlap OmpR-binding box IV and the -164 to -114 binding site for H-NS and StpA ( Fig. 4A , C and D ) . 
Interestingly , the LeuO binding site shared the ANTCA motif with the binding site at ompS2 ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) and leuO ( Chen et al. , 2003 ) ; and with a site required for LeuO activity on dsrA ( Repoila and Gottesman , 2001 ) . 
A DNase hypersensitive site between the contact points developed upon the binding of LeuO , indicating a restructuring in the DNA fold ( Fig. 4F ) . 
These data showed that the binding of H-NS and StpA was located at two sites and that LeuO bound upstream from the ompS1 regulatory region , overlapping with one binding site of H-NS and StpA , but not interacting with the promoter region and promoting a change in the local DNA architecture . 
cis-acting site required for LeuO derepression To demonstrate by genetic means the relevance of the LeuO binding region in the derepression of ompS1 , we generated a series of point mutants in the interaction site of the protein in agreement with the DNase footprinting assay . 
Thus , site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pRO310 reporter plasmid ( Fig. 5A ) . 
The pRO310 bIV -- mt1 mutant carried mutations on LeuO ( I ) ( -134 to -125 ) , the site with greater protection for LeuO ( Fig. 4F ) . 
The changes were A to T and T to A , preserving the G and C residues . 
The pRO310 bIV -- mt2 mutant carried mutations on LeuO ( II ) ( -113 to -102 ) modifying A to T ( Fig. 5A ) . 
The expression of the mutants was evaluated under the absence or presence of LeuO induction . 
The pRO310 bIV -- mt1 fusion resulted in the lack of activity under LeuO induction with respect to the wild type ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Moreover , the mutations did not disrupt the negative regulation of H-NS , because the activity level without LeuO induction was similar to the wild type . 
This shows that the LeuO ( I ) site is required for LeuO derepression . 
However , the mutations introduced on pRO310 bIV -- mt2 derepressed partially the expression without LeuO induction ; although there was still response to LeuO activation ( Fig. 5B ) . 
These observations are consistent with the notion that these LeuO ( II ) site mutants map indeed at a site of high affinity for H-NS at box IV ( Fig. 4A , C and D ) , resulting in partial derepression . 
The positive effect of LeuO on pRO310 bIV -- mt2 is also consistent with an unaltered LeuO ( I ) binding site . 
Moreover , the mutated TATATATCCT region at bIV -- mt2 corresponds to a highly protected region by H-NS ( Fig. 4D ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were preformed to examine the effect of the mutations on LeuO and H-NS binding to the -226 to + 27 F2 fragment , using as negative control fragment F5 ( -310 to -153 ) ( Fig. 5C ) . 
As can be observed , F2 derived from pRO310 bIV -- mt1 did not shift with LeuO ; however , it bound H-NS in agreement to the genetic data where these changes only alter the derepressing effect of LeuO ( Fig. 5B ) . 
F2 from pRO310 bIV -- mt2 bound to LeuO and also to H-NS ( Fig. 5C ) , but at higher H-NS concentrations as compared with F2 from the wild type and from pRO310 bIV -- mt1 ( Figs 4C and 5C ) . 
Different ompS1 -- lacZ fusions carrying various lengths of the 5 ′ regulatory region were transformed either with pFMTrc12 or with pFMTrcleuO-50 . 
pRO310 , pRO266 and pRO153 fusions responded to the LeuO-positive effect ; however , the pRO117 fusion was not positively regulated by LeuO , being similar to the pRO310 -- d4 ( Fig. 5D ) . 
This is also consistent with the notion of the relevance of the LeuO ( I ) binding site ( at -134 to -125 ) ( Fig. 4F ) . 
The fact that a set of mutations ( mt1 ) on the LeuO ( I ) binding site drastically affected LeuO but not H-NS activity , and that a second set ( mt2 ) on LeuO ( II ) binding site partially affected H-NS activity but not the effect of LeuO ( Fig. 5B ) , indicates that the zone around OmpR-binding box IV is key in the positive and negative regulation of ompS1 . 
LeuO acted as a derepressor, displacing H-NS from the ompS1 regulatory region
The highest level of ompS1 expression was attained either upon induction of LeuO in the wild type or else in an hns stpA background ( Figs 1 -- 3 ) . 
In order to assess the effect of LeuO in an hns stpA background , an E. coli double hns stpA mutant was used as the dominant negative hns system described earlier ( Fig. 3 ) could not be used because of plasmid incompatibility between pFMTrcleuO-50 and pT6-HNS-G113D . 
We thus tested two ompS1 fusions , pFV4 and pFV5 , being equivalent to pRO88 and pRO310 , respectively , but with the appropriate antibiotic resistance marker . 
The level of ompS1 expression in pFV5 in such hns stpA background did not increase in the presence of LeuO ( Fig. 6A ) , which is consistent with the notion that it is acting as a derepressor antagonizing H-NS and StpA action , and where LeuO is not acting by recruiting RNA polymerase to the ompS1 promoter . 
Competitive EMSAs between LeuO and H-NS for binding to the ompS1 regulatory region were performed to examine the effect of LeuO on H-NS bound to DNA . 
We examined the single binding of H-NS and LeuO to the F1 fragment from the 5 ′ regulatory region ( Fig. 4A ; Table 1 ) . 
Both proteins bound to F1-forming DNA -- protein complexes ( Fig. 6B ) . 
F1 was ﬁrst incubated with H-NS and then increasing amounts of LeuO were added . 
The H-NS -- DNA complexes , the displaced H-NS protein and the LeuO -- DNA complexes were detected by immunoblot with anti-Myc antibodies for H-NS and with a polyclonal antibody to LeuO respectively ( Fig. 6B ) . 
As can be observed , increasing amounts of LeuO modiﬁed the H-NS -- DNA complexes causing a displacement of H-NS from the bound DNA . 
Moreover , this displaced H-NS migrated higher than the unbound H-NS , suggesting that the displaced protein might be in an oligomeric state . 
Similar experiments showed that StpA was displaced by LeuO ( data not shown ) . 
Competitive EMSAs were performed incubating ﬁrst LeuO with F1 and adding subsequently H-NS ( Fig. 6C ) . 
Interestingly , DNA-bound LeuO was not displaced by the subsequent addition of H-NS ( Fig. 6C ) . 
This indicated that LeuO does effectively displace H-NS from the ompS1 regulatory region and that , once bound , it prevents H-NS binding . 
Discussion
LeuO , a regulator of the LysR family , was found to be a positive effector of the ompS1 gene in Salmonella . 
Previously , it was reported that LeuO positively regulates ompS2 ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
Furthermore , the regulation of these two quiescent genes is dependent on the level of induction of leuO ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Consequently , this could reﬂect a temporal expression in the cell dependent on the level of LeuO , where the expression of each porin was mutually exclusive . 
The fact that ompS2 expression diminishes at the highest levels of leuO induction ( Fig. 1A ) could mean that LeuO can act as a repressor aside rather than as an activator , for some genes . 
The repression of ompS2 observed at the higher levels of induction of the leuO gene could be due to the competition of LeuO for the binding site of the OmpR transcriptional activator as ompS2 expression is dependent of LeuO and OmpR ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
The maximum level of ompS1 expression was reached either by the action of LeuO or in an hns stpA background ( Figs 1 , 2 , 3 and 6A ) . 
StpA has been described as a molecular back-up that acts in the absence of H-NS , having both overlapping and distinct functions ( Sondén and Uhlin , 1996 ; Zhang et al. , 1996 ) . 
In uropathogenic E. coli the gene expression pattern of an hns stpA double mutant differed from that of the hns single mutant , suggesting the existence of a second regulon that is dependent on the presence of both regulators , presumably in the form of a heteromeric complex ( Müller et al. , 2006 ) . 
Thus , the regulatory model for ompS1 presented also involves StpA as a negative regulator . 
The negative effect of StpA on ompS1 was only observed in the hns background ; in the stpA background ompS1 expression was as in the wild type ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Such dual control would probably play a role in the silencing of genes acquired by horizontal transfer , which would be required in an environment other than the standard laboratory conditions ( Lucchini et al. , 2006 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ) . 
Interestingly , 
LeuO antagonizes H-NS and StpA in ompS1 737 coding sequences for both H-NS and StpA are present in several enterobacteriaceae including E. coli and S. enterica , members of the Shigella genus and in Erwinia carotovora ( Madrid et al. , 2007 ) . 
Moreover , StpA as H-NS can interact with other regulatory proteins such as the Hha/YmoA family ( Paytubi et al. , 2004 ) . 
StpA also can function as an RNA chaperone as in the case of the ompF porin gene , which positively regulates at the posttranscriptional level by means of stabilizing MicF , an antisense RNA of the ompF transcript ( Deighan et al. , 2000 ) . 
The P1 and P2 ompS1 promoters are regulated in a hierarchical manner . 
That is , the OmpR response regulator differentially determines transcription from P1 hindering transcription from P2 , which is active in the absence of OmpR ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
Such hierarchy was maintained upon derepression by LeuO ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Thus , whereas the induction of ompS2 expression by LeuO is from a sole OmpR-dependent promoter ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) , the induction of ompS1 can occur independent of OmpR . 
The data show that in S. Typhi LeuO caused derepression of the pRO310 fusion , reaching the maximum levels as observed from the pRO88 fusion , both in the wild type and in the hns background ( Fig. 2A ) . 
As in the hns stpA background such maximum level was also observed ( Figs 3 and 6A ) , we postulate that LeuO acts as a derepressor and not as an activator in ompS1 regulation ( Fig. 6A ) . 
This highest level of expression allowed the detection of OmpS1 as a major OMP ( Figs 1B , 2C and 3B ) . 
Together with this genetic evidence , it was found that LeuO could displace H-NS from the 5 ′ regulatory region ( Fig. 6B and C ) ; and a binding site for H-NS , StpA and LeuO was mapped around the previously deﬁned OmpR-binding box IV , -124 to -107 bp upstream of the transcriptional start for promoter P1 ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The concurrence in the binding of all four regulators denotes a central key regulatory site that reﬂects a complex regulatory circuit ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Furthermore , it has been observed previously that the deletion of OmpR box IV , in the pRO310 -- d4 derivative , results in a considerable derepression of the pRO310 template both in the wild type and in the hns background , and in the abolishment of negative regulation in the hns mutant at high osmolarity ( Fig. 5D , Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
These earlier observations fully concur with the model proposed here . 
In terms of the DNA binding site for LeuO , it has not been extensively characterized . 
Nevertheless , the LeuO binding site ( between -137 and -99 ) on ompS1 shares the sequence ANTCA ( Fig. 4F ) with the binding sites at the ompS2 and leuO genes , and with a site for LeuO activity on dsrA ( Repoila and Gottesman , 2001 ; Chen et al. , 2003 ; Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
Binding of LeuO resulted in what appears to be a DNA fold , which is revealed by the appearance of a DNase hypersensitive region as seen previously for ompS2 ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
The introduction of punctual mutations ( mt1 ) in the LeuO binding region showed that the LeuO ( I ) site at -134 to -125 was required for derepression of ompS1 expression by LeuO and that it was independent of H-NS action ( Fig. 5A and B ) . 
In addition , these mutations impeded LeuO binding ( Fig. 5C ) . 
This idea was corroborated when different length gene reporter fusions that did not include the LeuO ( I ) site were not positively regulated by LeuO ( Fig. 5E ) , even though one of them ( pRO117 ) still included the LeuO ( II ) binding site . 
Hence , the mutated residues in mt1 appear to be determinant for LeuO binding as observed by EMSA ( Fig. 5C ) . 
On the other hand , mutation ( mt2 ) of the LeuO ( II ) binding site had a different effect ( Fig. 5B ) . 
In the absence of LeuO , ompS1 activity was partially derepressed , indicating that an H-NS binding site was affected as corroborated by EMSA and DNase footprinting ( Fig. 5C and D ) . 
Most importantly , in mt2 , LeuO binding and activity were preserved ( Fig. 5B and C ) . 
Therefore , LeuO ( I ) appeared to be the key site for LeuO-mediated derepression . 
However , the LeuO ( II ) site could be required for enhancing the LeuO derepressor effect as it is protected by LeuO ( Fig. 4F ) . 
Similarly , box 2 of the of icsB gene in Shigella ﬂexneri has been shown to be critical for VirB-mediated derepression , in contrast to box 1 ( Turner and Dorman , 2007 ) . 
H-NS and StpA bound at a downstream sequence located at -59 to -25 ( Fig. 4A -- C ) . 
Hence , this binding site and the one upstream at -164 to -114 might be nucleation sites for oligomerization of H-NS or StpA , as described for the proU gene ( Bouffartigues et al. , 2007 ) . 
This would lead to the formation of a putative repressor complex that blocks RNA polymerase ( Figs 4A and 7 ) . 
The region of -113 to -102 , at the LeuO ( II ) binding site , forms part of an H-NS nucleation site as mutations in this site ( mt2 ) resulted in the derepression of ompS1 expression ( Fig. 5A and B ) and the DNase footprinting showed that this site had highest affinity for H-NS ( Fig. 4D ) . 
Interestingly , the sequence at the LeuO ( II ) binding site ( TATATATCCT ) presents homology to the H-NS nucleation site of the proU gene ( AATATATCGA ) ( Bouffartigues et al. , 2007 ) and the mt2 mutant at this site ( TTTTTTTCCT ) showed less affinity for H-NS ( Fig. 5A and C ) . 
Another binding site for H-NS was mapped downstream around OmpR box I ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Interestingly , it contains the motif TAAATATCTT at -62 to -53 between OmpR-binding boxes II and I . 
These observations support our model that involves two sites of interaction of H-NS necessary for the repression as was seen for the proU gene ( Bouffartigues et al. , 2007 ) , probably forming a nucleoprotein complex . 
However , fragment F4 ( -114 to +27 ) that carries both putative nucleation sites did not shift with H-NS ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Nevertheless , fragments F3 ( -164 to +27 ) and F6 ( -153 to +1 ) that contain both proposed nucleation sites plus upstream and downstream sequences do shift with H-NS ( Fig. 4C ) , indicating a possible role of such adjacent regions in the enhancement of DNA -- H-NS complexes as was seen in the DNase footprinting ( Fig. 4D ) . 
In this respect , the pRO310 -- d4 fusion , deleted for -135 to -105 , did not reach the maximum expression level represented by pRO88 ( Oropeza et al. , 1999 ) , an observation similar to that for the proU gene where the mutation of both nucleation sites derepressed the expression of the gene but not to its maximum level ( Bouffartigues et al. , 2007 ) . 
The fragment derived from pRO310 -- d4 diminished its affinity to H-NS with respect to the wild type but still shifted ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
This further indicates that probable existence of such other sites of H-NS interaction upstream and downstream of the deleted region . 
In accordance , it has been proposed that for the regulation of the proU gene the H-NS binding region consists of a series of small binding sites forming modules that are organized around two nucleation sites ( Bouffartigues et al. , 2007 ) . 
Hence , our model for ompS1 regulation involves the LeuO , OmpR , H-NS and StpA regulators ( Fig. 7 ) . 
We propose that LeuO binds at -134 to -125 , at LeuO ( I ) box , displacing H-NS and StpA and modifying the DNA local architecture , while OmpR would bind in the proximity of the promoter region differentially regulating P1 or P2 ( Fig. 7 ) . 
The interaction of H-NS and StpA solely with a second binding site ( -59 to -25 ) would not be enough to form the nucleorepressor complex , as its stability would be dependent on the binding of H-NS and StpA to both sites . 
Moreover , previous genetic data show that the removal of upstream regions from -310 to -88 gradually caused the derepression of ompS1 expression ( Fig. 5C , Oropeza et al. , 1999 ; Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) which , together with the H-NS DNase footprinting data ( Fig. 4D ) , suggest that H-NS binds at the two nucleation sites proposed and polymerizes throughout the entire 5 ′ upstream region , a type of interaction that has been proposed for H-NS ( Dorman , 2007 ) . 
In addition , no signiﬁcant intrinsic curvature was found in silico between the two putative nucleation sites , which is not consistent with the formation of a repressive loop . 
For the leuO locus , LeuO-mediated regulation involves the binding of the protein to the promoter region blocking the progress of the nucleorepressor ﬁlament ( Chen and Wu , 2005 ) . 
Our model is different by various criteria . 
LeuO acts as a derepressor for ompS1 expression by binding upstream of the promoter and not in the proximal region . 
In addition , our model contemplates that LeuO physically 
LeuO antagonizes H-NS and StpA in ompS1 739 does not block the progress of H-NS but rather causes a displacement of H-NS , hence preventing its binding at the nucleation sites and its polymerization , and causing a change in DNA structure as shown by the formation of a DNase hypersensitive site ( Figs 6B and C and 4F ) . 
Changes in the DNA conformation caused by a derepressor were seen for the regulation of icsB gene by VirB ( Turner and Dorman , 2007 ) and for the gadA and gadBC genes by means of GadX and GadW in E. coli ( Tramonti et al. , 2006 ) . 
Thus , members of several families of transcriptional regulators have been described as antagonists of H-NS : VirF ( AraC/XylS family ) ( Tobe et al. , 1993 ) , RovA ( SlyA/Hor ) ( Heroven et al. , 2004 ) and Ler ( H-NS/StpA ) ( Bustamante et al. , 2001 ) , among others . 
The studies reported here involve a regulator of the LysR family , LeuO , as a derepressor by displacement of H-NS and StpA . 
Although there are only a few known genes directly regulated by LeuO , the new mechanism described here illustrates the versatility in LeuO function . 
In this respect , for instance , Yersinia enterocolitica RovA acts as a derepressor of H-NS , differentially binds to two genes : inv and rovA ( Heroven et al. , 2004 ) . 
Similarly , differential binding were observed for the GadW and GadX regulators in the regulation of gadA and gadBC in E. coli ( Tramonti et al. , 2006 ) . 
The observation that both ompS1 and ompS2 were regulated by LeuO at different levels of induction opens the possibility that there is a regulon in S. enterica , where various genes are expressed at different levels according to the concentration of LeuO in the bacterial cell . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, plasmids and recombinant DNA techniques
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2 . 
DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . 
Oligo-nucleotides used for ampliﬁcation by PCR were provided by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility at our institute and are listed in Table 1 . 
PCRs were performed with Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) , according to the instructions by the manufacturer . 
The one-step mutagenesis procedure described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) for bacterial chromosomal genes was used to generate gene deletions and replacements for antibiotic resistance markers . 
Generation of point mutants in the LeuO binding site
The mutations introduced were performed using the strategy of inverse PCR . 
We used as template the pRO310 fusion , designing complementary primers that carry the desired changes . 
The primers used were : 5 ′ - AAATGATAAAATA 
TGTCATATTCTTAG-3 ′ and 5 ′ - CTAAGAATAATATGACATAT TTTATCATTT-3 ′ ( pRO310 bIV -- mt1 ) ; 5 ′ - CTTAGTCACTTT TTTTTCCTGTATTATAAA-3 ′ and 5 ′ - TTTATAATACAGGAAAA AAAAGTGACTAAG-3 ′ ( pRO310 bIV -- mt2 ) . 
The PCR products were digested with DpnI to eliminate the template and transformed in MC4100 . 
The candidates were sequenced to verify their identity . 
Bacterial culture, b-galactosidase and CAT assays
Bacteria were grown in nutrient broth ( low osmolarity ) or nutrient broth plus 0.3 M NaCl ( high osmolarity ) at 37 °C and collected at mid-logarithmic phase . 
The culture conditions and microplate protein and b-galactosidase assays were as previously described ( Flores-Valdez et al. , 2003 ) . 
CAT assays and protein quantiﬁcation to calculate Cloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) - speciﬁc activities were performed as described previously ( Martinez-Laguna et al. , 1999 ) . 
OMP puriﬁcation and electrophoresis
Outer membrane proteins were prepared as a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction and scaled down to a mini-prep level as described previously ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
They were separated by SDS-12 % polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis ( PAGE ) and visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue . 
Primer extension analysis
Total RNAs were isolated from samples of cultures grown in nutrient broth at 37 °C and collected at mid-logarithmic phase . 
Five micrograms of total RNA ( for ompA ) or 25 mg of total RNA ( for ompS1 ) , isolated by using commercial kit ( Rneasy , Qiagen ) , was denatured at 90 °C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to 50 °C . 
The RNA was annealed with [ g-32P ] ATP-labelled ompA-PE 5 ′ - TTTGCGCCTCGTTATCATCCAA-3 ′ 
( annealing from position +3 to -24 with respect to the translational start site ) or primer ompS1-PE 5 ′ - TTGCT GCGCCTGCCACTAATAAC-3 ′ ( annealing from +57 to +35 with respect to the translational start site ) . 
Primers were extended with Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for 2 h , and the extended products were collected with a Microcon-30 microconcentrator ( Amicon ) and analysed by electrophoresis in urea-8 % polyacrylamide gels alongside sequencing ladders . 
Isolation and puriﬁcation of H-NS-Myc-6XHis, StpA-T7-6XHis and LeuO-6XHis proteins
The S. Typhi hns structural gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using with the forward primer 5 ′ - ACTACCATGGGCGAAGCAC TTAAAATTC-3 ′ and the reverse primer 5 ′ - GTACTCGA GTCCTTGATCAGGAAATCTTCC-3 ′ . 
Then digested with NcoI-XhoI and ﬁnally cloned into pBAD/Myc-His C . 
The S. Typhi stpA structural gene was ampliﬁed with the forward primer 5 ′ - ATTGCCATGGATTTGATGTTACAGAACTTAAAT-3 ′ and the reverse primer 5 ′ - TTATCCGCATATGGATTAA GAAATCATCCAGAGATT-3 ′ , digested with NcoI-NdeI and cloned into pET-28b ( + ) . 
LeuO was previously cloned to the expression vector pTrc99A ( Fernández-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
Puriﬁcation of H-NS-Myc-6XHis , StpA-T7-6XHis and LeuO-6XHis proteins was performed with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin ( QIAExpress , Qiagen ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and the modiﬁcations established by Barba et al. ( 2006 ) . 
Brieﬂy , E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) carrying the pMDHNS , pMDStpA or pFMTrcleuO-50 plasmids ( Table 2 ) was grown to mid-logarithmic phase . 
L ( + ) - arabinose ( Sigma-Aldrich ) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 % , or IPTG to 1 mM , and the bacteria were incubated to 200 r.p.m. for 4 h at 37 °C . 
Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation , resuspended in urea buffer [ 8 M urea , 100 mM NaH2PO4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) ] and disrupted by sonication . 
The suspension was centrifuged , and the supernatant was ﬁltered through a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column ( QIAExpress , Qiagen ) ; the column was washed with urea buffer at pH 8.0 and urea buffer at pH 6.0 , and ﬁnally the bound protein was eluted with urea buffer at pH 4.5 . 
Fractions containing puriﬁed H-NS-Myc-His6 , StpA-T7-His6 and LeuO-His6 proteins were selected after SDS-PAGE . 
The selected fractions were loaded into a Slyde-A-Lyzer 10K cassette ( Pierce ) and gradually dialysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 10 mM MgCl2 , 20 % glycerol , 0.5 M NaCl , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , various amounts of urea ( 4 , 1 and 0.2 M ) , which was changed every hour . 
The ﬁnal dialysis was done in storage buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 10 mM MgCl2 , 20 % glycerol , 240 mM NaCl , 0.1 % Triton X-100 and 3 mM EDTA , and aliquots of the puriﬁed proteins were stored at -70 °C . 
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford procedure . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Polymerase chain reactions that generated various ompS1 products encompassing the 5 ′ regulatory region were obtained , using plasmid pRO310 as template and series of oligonucleotide primers ( Table 1 ) . 
The fragments ( ~ 100 ng in 
20 ml ) were mixed with increasing concentrations of H-NS-Myc-6XHis or StpA-T7-6XHis , in the presence of the binding buffer H/S 10 ¥ ( 400 mM HEPES , 80 mM MgCl2 , 500 mM KCl , 10 mM DTT , 0.5 % NP40 and 1 mg ml-1 BSA ) . 
They were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then separated by electrophoresis in 6 % native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 ¥ Tris-borate-EDTA buffer . 
For LeuO-6XHis the mixture was in the presence of binding buffer L 10 ¥ ( 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EDTA and 20 % glycerol ) . 
LeuO was incubated with DNA for 30 min at room temperature . 
The DNA bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide . 
Competitive EMSAs were performed incubating ﬁrst with one protein and then incubating with DNA ; followed by the addition of the other protein and incubation . 
DNase I footprinting assays
Plasmid pRO310 was used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation of the ompS1 5 ′ regulatory region . 
A 32P-labelled oligonucleotide complementary to the 5 ′ - coding sequence of ompS1 ( 5 ′ - TACTTTTCTTTTCATTTTTT-3 ′ ) and an oligo-nucleotide complementary to -253 to -228 bp relative to the transcriptional start P1 ( 5 ′ - TCGCTCAAGAAAATTAAATT AAAAAA-3 ′ ) were used . 
The binding of LeuO to the labelled DNA fragment was performed at room temperature ; in a buffer that contained 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM DTT , 20 % glycerol and 1 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) . 
The reaction mixture was treated with different concentrations of DNase I . 
The DNase footprinting with H-NS was performed at 6 °C . 
The DNA segments were separated by electrophoresis in 8 % polyacrylamide-8 M urea gels alongside sequencing ladders . 
Western blotting
Samples subjected to native-PAGE ( 6 % polyacrylamide ) , and transferred to 0.22-mm-pore-size nitrocellulose membranes ( Amersham , UK ) in a semidry electrophoresis unit ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Membranes were blocked with 5 % non-fat milk and incubated with anti-Myc or anti-T7 monoclonal antibodies ( Sigma ) , or anti-LeuO polyclonal antibodies . 
Membranes were washed with ( PBS 1 ¥ ) -0.05 % Tween 20 , immunostained with a 1:10 000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit antibodies ( Pierce ) , for monoclonal or polyclonal ﬁrst antibodies respectively , and developed with Chemiglow chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer ( Alpha Innotech ) .
