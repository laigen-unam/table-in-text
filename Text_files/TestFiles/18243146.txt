Abstract 
O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase catalyzes the final step of the biosynthesis of L-cysteine , the replacement of the β-acetoxy group of O-acetyl-L-serine ( OAS ) by a thiol . 
The enzyme undergoes a conformational change to close the site upon formation of the external Schiff base ( ESB ) with OAS . 
Mutation of K120 to Q was predicted to destabilize the closed form of the ESB and decrease the rate . 
The K120Q mutant enzyme was prepared and characterized by UV-visible absorbance , fluorescence , visible CD , and 31P NMR spectral studies , as well as steady state and pre-steady state kinetic studies . 
Spectra suggest a shift in the tautomeric equilibrium toward the neutral enolimine and an increase in the rate of interconversion of the open and closed forms of the enzyme . 
A decrease in the rate of both half reactions likely reflects the stabilization of the ESB as a result of the increased rate of equilibration of the open and closed forms of the enzyme along the reaction pathway . 
Data suggest a role of K120 in helping to stabilize the closed conformation by participating in a new hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of A231 .

O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A catalyzes the final step in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway , a β-replacement reaction in which the β-acetoxy group of O-acetyl-L-serine is replaced by a thiol [ 1 ] . 
The PLP-dependent enzyme exhibits a ping-pong Bi Bi mechan-ism with the first half of the reaction resulting in the conversion of the internal Schiff base ( ISB ) 1 to an α-aminoacrylate intermediate ( AA ) and acetate [ 2,3 ] . 
Several structures of the A-isozyme have been solved , including that of the ISB of the native enzyme [ 4 ] , and that of the K41A mutant enzyme , which exists as an external

Schiff ( ESB ) between a free methionine and PLP [ 5 ] . 
The ISB exists in an open conformation , while the ESB has a closed active site that resulted from a rotation of the N-terminal domain . 
Closure of the active site is triggered by interaction of the α-carboxylate of OAS or an amino acid analogue upon formation of the ESB with the substrate-binding loop ( 174-GTTGT-178 ) [ 5 ] . 
The interaction results in a relaxation of the N-terminal central β-sheet , which bring the loop and the substrate carboxylate into closer proximity . 
The above interaction stabilizes the ESB , and is further stabilized by interactions between the N - and C-terminal domains as they are brought into close proximity . 
One of the more prominent interactions is provided by K120 . 
The location of K120 is on the surface of the N-terminal domain at the entrance to the active site of OASS-A , Fig. 1A . 
Upon formation of the external Schiff base and closure of the site [ 5 ] , the side chain of K120 forms a new hydrogen bond ( 2.9 Å ) to the backbone carbonyl of A231 , Fig. 1B . 
Other than this interaction , the closest neighbors to the ɛ-amine of K120 are the backbone NH of A231 ( 4.0 Å ) , the backbone NH of M119 ( 3.8 Å ) , and the backbone carbonyl of K117 ( 4.2 Å )

Lysine 120 is highly conserved in OASS from bacteria to plants . 
In the few cases where K120 is not conserved the sequences are significantly different than those of the species that have the lysine conserved , Fig. 2B . 
For example , the sequence identity , compared to the Salmonella OASS-A , for Emericella and Schizosaccharomyces are 35 % and 33 % , respectively . 
This can be compared to sequence identities , compared to the Salmo-nella OASS-A sequence , ranging from 70 -- 97 % for species in which K120 is conserved . 
The highly conserved nature of K120 is suggestive of its importance in the mechanism of OASS . 
In this manuscript , K120 is changed to the smaller Q , which still has hydrogen-bonding potential , but is shorter than K and uncharged , to probe its effect on the reaction mechanism . 
The resulting mutant enzyme was characterized using a battery of spectroscopic and kinetic probes . 
The resulting data are interpreted in terms of the mechanism of the sulfhydrylase , spe-cifically with respect to stabilization of the external Schiff base in both half reactions .

The gene , cysK , which encodes OASS-A is cloned in the plasmid pRSM40 [ 6 ] . 
1.3. Enzyme
K120 was replaced with glutamine using the technique of cassette mutagenesis via PCR according to previously published procedures [ 7,8 ] . 
The resulting mutant gene was completely sequenced to be sure no other mutations were present , and none were found . 
Mutant proteins were then isolated using the same methods as for the wild type plasmid-containing strain [ 7,8 ] . 
The cell mass from overnight growths and the amount of mutant proteins obtained were similar to those obtained for wild type . 
The mutant enzyme was purified by the method of Tai et al [ 9 ] . 
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded for each fraction of the Q-Sepharose and phenyl Sepharose columns . 
The fractions with an A280/A412 of 5.0 were pooled and concentrated . 
Purity of the enzyme was further tested via SDS-PAGE , and the enzyme was N95 % pure . 
1.4. UV-visible spectral studies
UV-visible spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard , model 8452A photodiode array spectrophotometer . 
Spectra of the mutant enzyme were measured at pH 6.5 , 100 mM HEPES in the absence and presence of 1 mM OAS , and at pH 9.5 , 100 mM Ches in the absence and presence of 10 mM L-cysteine or 100 mM L-serine . 
Spectra were recorded at wavelengths from 250 to 600 nm using 1 cm path length cuvettes at 25 °C . 
Buffer and amino acid blanks were subtracted from the spectra . 
1.5. Fluorescence studies
Fluorescence spectra of wt and mutant enzymes ( 100 μg / mL ) were obtained on a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorometer in the absence and presence of amino acids at 25 °C . 
Spectra of the K120Q mutant enzyme were measured at pH 6.5 , 100 mM HEPES in the absence and presence of 1 mM OAS , and at pH 9.5 , 100 mM Ches in the absence and presence of 10 mM L-cysteine or 100 mM L-serine . 
Excitation was at 298 nm and the excitation and emission slit widths were set to 5 nm . 
Emission was measured over the wavelength range 300 to 550 nm . 
Buffer and amino acid blanks were subtracted from the spectra . 
1.6. Circular dichroism studies
CD spectra were collected on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter at 25 °C with a path length of 0.2 cm . 
Enzyme concentrations of 100 μg / mL and 4 mg mL were used for far UV and visible CD spectra , respectively . 
The buffer used for all spectra was 10 mM phosphate , pH 7.0 and a buffer blank was subtracted from each spectrum . 
Spectra were collected with a dwell time of 3 s , and were the average of three spectra . 
Far-UV spectra were measured from 200 -- 250 nm , while visible spectra were measured from 300 -- 550 nm .

The figures were made using the program PyMOL ( www.pymol.org ) and the coordinates of the open ( 1OAS ) and K41A mutant ( 1D6S ) of OASS-A molecule from the Protein Data Bank . 
1.7. 31P NMR spectroscopy
Fourier transform 31P NMR spectra were collected at 121.497 MHz on a Bruker AM300 SWB superconducting spectrometer using a 10-mm multinuclear probe head with broadband 1H decoupling . 
The NMR tube , spinning at 15 -- 20 Hz , contained the sample ( 2 mL ) and 2H2O ( 0.2 mL ) as field/frequency lock and was maintained at 20 ± 0.1 °C using thermostatted continuous air flow . 
A spectral width of 2000 Hz was acquired in 8 K data points with a pulse angle of 60 ° . 
The exponential line broadening used prior to Fourier transformation was 10 Hz . 
Protein samples were dissolved in 50 mM Mes or HEPES buffers containing 1 mM EDTA at the appropriate pH. Changes in pH were performed by dialysis against the desired buffer overnight . 
pH values of the sample were determined before and after the NMR measurement . 
Positive chemical shifts in ppm are downfield changes with respect to 85 % H3PO4 . 
1.8. Initial velocity studies
Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the disappearance of TNB at 412 nm ( ɛ − 1 − 1 412 , 13,600 M cm [ 10 ] ) . 
Measurement of kinetic parameters was carried out according to Tai et al. [ 9,11 ] . 
All assays were carried out in 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 , and 25 °C . 
The pH dependence of kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes was also determined as previously described [ 11 ] . 
Measurements were made using the following buffers at 100 mM concentration for the pH ranges indicated : Mes , 5.5 -- 6.5 ; Mops , 7.0 -- 7.5 ; HEPES , 8.0 ; and Taps , 9.0 . 
All assay buffers used in these studies were titrated with KOH . 
The pH of the reaction was confirmed by measuring the pH of the reaction solution before and after measurements . 
1.9. Rapid scanning stopped-flow
Pre-steady state kinetic measurements were carried out using an OLIS-RSM 1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer in the multiple wavelength mode . 
Sample solutions were prepared in two syringes at the same pH with a final HEPES concentration of 100 mM . 
The first syringe contained enzyme at a final concentration no lower than 15 μM , while the second syringe contai-ned OAS at twice the final desired concentration . 
Experiments were repeated at several different concentrations of OAS . 
Data were collected with a repetitive scan rate of 15 ms for K120Q over the wavelength range 300 -- 600 nm . 
The appearance of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate was monitored at 470 nm , and the disappearance of the internal Schiff base was monitored at 412 nm . 
The reaction temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a circula-ting water bath

2. Results
Lysine 120 is the only residue on the N-terminal domain near the entrance to the active site with an ionic side chain that is within hydrogen-bonding distance to residues of the C-ter-minal domain . 
The lysine is highly conserved suggestive of its importance to the mechanism of OASS . 
As a result it was of interest to determine the effect of the ion-dipolar interaction on the reaction catalyzed by OASS-A . 
Mutation of K120 to the shorter Q might be expected to influence the equilibrium between open and closed form , favoring the open form , but might still be capable of forming a weaker hydrogen bond . 
Overall a decrease in the rate of the reaction was predicted , the magnitude of which would be proportional to the amount of open form .

A. Absorbance spectra in the absence and presence of amino acids measured at 25 °C . 
Spectra 1 ( free enzyme ) and 4 ( 1 mM OAS ) were measured at pH 6.5 , 100 mM HEPES , while spectra 2 ( 100 mM L-serine ) and 3 ( 10 mM Lcysteine ) were measured at pH 9.5 , 100 mM Ches . 
B. Fluorescence spectra [ 1 -- 4 ] measured under the same conditions as in A. Excitation was at 298 nm , and spectra were corrected for those of buffer and amino acid alone . 
2.1. UV-Visible spectral studies
Spectra obtained for the K120Q mutant enzyme are similar but not identical to those of the wild type enzyme ( data not shown ) , Fig. 3A . 
The internal aldimine exhibits a maximum at 412 nm , and also has significant absorbance at 330 nm compa-red to the wt ; the ɛ412 is about 4 % lower than wild type . 
Addition of 1 mM OAS at pH 6.5 , gives a change qualitatively identical to that observed for the wild type enzyme with a decrease in the absorbance at 412 nm and a concomitant increase in the absorbance at 468 nm and 325 nm . 
The extinction coefficient for the AA at 468 nm is lower than the value for the wt enzyme [ 3 ] . 
In addition , there is a much higher absorbance at 325 nm compared to that observed for the wt enzyme . 
Data are consistent with a higher concentration of the enolimine tautomer , Scheme 1 , for the K120Q mutant enzyme compared to the wt enzyme ; Scheme 1 shows the tautomeric equilibrium for the ISB . 
The pyridine ring is shown in the neutral form consistent with structural [ 4 ] and mechanistic data [ 20 ] . 
Spectra of the external Schiff bases of lanthionine2 and serine are also qualitatively identical to those of the wild type enzyme . 
The serine ESB gives an increase in the extinction coefficient at 325 nm compared to wt , with a value nearly identical at 418 nm [ 13 ] . 
The cysteine ESB has an extinction coefficient that is lower than that of the wt at 418 nm . 
The ESB also has significant absorbance at 325 nm , and a shoulder at 440 nm , while the wt enzyme has very little absorbance at 325 nm [ 13 ] . 
Data are summarized in Table 1 . 
2.2. Fluorescence spectra
The spectrum obtained at pH 6.5 upon excitation at 298 nm exhibits maxima at 337 and 500 nm , Fig. 3B . 
The 337 nm ban is well formed , while the long wavelength band is of low intensity and broad . 
Although the relative fluorescence at 337 nm is quantitatively identical to wt , lower emission at 500 nm is observed [ 14 ] . 
Addition of 100 mM L-serine at pH 9.5 results in an increase in tryptophan emission at 337 nm , and a blue shift of the long wavelength band to 492 nm along with a 6-fold enhancement in emission intensity . 
A further increase in the long wavelength fluorescence intensity , also centered at 492 nm , is observed in the presence of 10 mM L-cysteine at pH 9.5 , along with a slight increase in the intensity of the 337 nm band . 
The resulting ratio of F337/F492 is similar to the value measured for wt [ 13 ] . 
Formation of the AA results in a slight red shift in tryptophan fluorescence to about 340 nm , with an intensity identical to that of free enzyme , and a loss of the long wavelength fluorescence . 
The loss of long wavelength fluorescence parallels loss of the ketoeneamine band and generation of the 468 nm band of the AA . 
Data are summarized in Table 1 .

B. Fluorescence spectra [ 1 -- 4 ] measured under the same conditions as in A. Excitation was at 298 nm , and spectra were corrected for those of buffer and amino acid alone . 
Table 1 
2.3. Circular dichroism spectral studies
No change is observed in the far UV CD spectra of the K120Q mutant enzyme with respect to that of the wild type enzyme ( data not shown ) . 
The visible CD spectra obtained for the mutant enzyme are shown in Fig. 4 . 
Spectra exhibit a positive Cotton effect for the free enzyme centered on the maximum absorbance of the ISB , while the AA intermediate gives a negative Cotton effect of intensity equal to that of the ISB , but centered on the aborbance maximum of the AA , Fig. 4A . 
A slight negative Cotton effect is observed above 300 nm for the AA . 
Data are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the wild type enzyme . 
The spectra for the serine and lanthionine ESBs also exhibit positive Cotton effects centered on the maximum absorbance of the absorbance spectra , but with an approximately 1.5-fold higher intensity for the cysteine ESB . 
Data are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the wild type enzyme [ 13 ] . 
Data are summarized in Table 1 . 
2.4. 31P NMR spectra
Spectra obtained for the K120Q mutant enzyme , Fig. 5 , are similar to those of wt OASS-A . 
The internal Schiff base exhi-bits a sharp single peak at 5.16 ppm to 5.18 ppm and is pH independent over the range 6.5 -- 9 , while the AA exhibits an equally narrow signal at 3.94 ppm at pH 6.5 . 
Formation of the lanthionine Schiff base at pH 9.5 by addition of L-cysteine gives a single resonance at 5.16 ppm , identical to that of free enzyme

2.5. Initial rate studies
A double reciprocal plot of initial rate vs. OAS at different fixed levels of TNB gave a series of parallel lines consistent with the ping-pong kinetic mechanism reported previously ( data not shown ) [ 2,9 ] . 
The turnover number of the K120Q mutant enzyme is decreased by N50-fold compared to the wt enzyme . 
On the other hand , the V/K values for OAS and TNB are decreased by only 3.7 - and 6.7-fold , respectively . 
Kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2 . 
Although the absolute values of kinetic parameters are decreased compared to wt , the pH-rate profiles for the K120Q mutant enzyme exhibits pKa values that are identical to those of wt using OAS and β-chloro-L-alanine as substrates ( data not shown ) . 
2.6. Pre-steady state kinetic studies
Rapid-scanning stopped-flow experiments measured upon mixing the mutant enzymes and OAS , gave spectra showing a decrease in the absorbance at 412 nm and an increase in the absorbance at 325 and 470 nm , consistent with the formation of the AA ( see above ) . 
Spectra exhibit a single isosbestic point at 430 nm , indicative of the interconversion of the ISB and AA with no other intermediates present at a significant concentration ( data not shown ) .

3. Discussion
3.1. Spectral properties
The wild type OASS-A exhibits a pH independent maximum at 412 nm with very little absorbance around 325 nm . 
The tautomeric equilibrium between the ketoeneamine and enolimine tautomers thus lies far toward the former in the ISB [ 3 ] . 
The predominance of the ketoeneamine tautomer suggests dipolar interactions with the protein surface , and indirectly suggests the reaction takes place via this tautomer in the ISB [ 16 ] . 
The tautomeric equilibrium changes dependent on the intermediate considered along the reaction pathway . 
The tautomeric equili-brium in the ESB of lanthionine ( formed from cysteine ) is very similar to that of the ISB , with the long lanthionine side chain likely extending into solvent and bound by the enzyme fixing the position of the cofactor similar to the situation found for the methionine ESB in the K41A mutant enzyme [ 5 ] . 
The serine ESB and AA , on the other hand exhibit significant absorbance at 325 nm , and thus contribution from the enolimine tautomer , Table 1 . 
This likely results from an increased flexibility of the cofactor and/or less localized charge in the vicinity of the cofactor as the cofactor moves upon formation of the ESB and AA . 
Replacing K120 , a residue at a site distant from the active site on the enzyme 's surface at the entrance to the active site , results in a shift in the tautomeric equilibrium toward the enolimine at all stages along the reaction pathway , as indicated by the increa-sed absorbance at 325 nm , Table 1 . 
The UV-visible absorbance spectral data are corroborated by those obtained from visible CD , given the observed increase in ellipticity at 325 nm for all species except the AA . 
However , the intensity of the induced CD signal centered on the visible maximum is very similar to that observed for wt in all cases , suggesting an increase in molar ellipticity for all species except the lanthionine ESB , Table 1 . 
In the case of the lanthionine ESB and the ISB , the cofactor , as stated above , is expected to have lower mobility than the serine ESB or AA . 
Fluorescence emission spectra show only slight changes in the ratio of intensities of tryptophan emission ( 337 nm ) to long wavelength cofactor emission ( 492 -- 500 nm ) suggesting the environment around the chromophores is similar in wt and mutant enzymes , Table 1 . 
The long wavelength band results from triplet-singlet energy transfer from tryptophan to the ketoeneamine tautomer of the internal Schiff base [ 17,18 ] . 
Given the increase in the concentration of the enolimine tautomer discussed above , one would expect a decrease in long wavelength fluorescence derived from the ketoeneamine tautomer resulting in an increase in the ratio of intensity at 337 nm to that at long wavelength . 
However , this is only observed in the case of the ISB , suggesting compensating changes in lifetime and/or orientation of the cofactor in the ESBs and AA . 
The 31P NMR spectra for the mutant and wt enzymes are very similar . 
The chemical shift observed for the ISB and AA are identical to those of the wt , as are the line widths of the signals , Table 1 . 
Data for the wt enzyme were interpreted as indicating a dianionic phosphate tightly bound to , and rota-ting with , the enzyme [ 13 ] . 
The lower chemical shift of the AA is indicative of the higher mobility of the cofactor . 
The chemical shift measured for wt and K120Q for the ESB of serine with its small side chain , is lower than that of the ISB , but slightly greater than that of the AA , again consistent with the increased mobility of the cofactor and looser binding of the 5 ′ - phosphate . 
In agreement , the lanthionine ESB , with its lon-ger , tightly bound side chain , exhibits a chemical shift , for wt and K120Q , slightly greater than that of the ISB . 
However , the line widths compared to the ISB are broad for the wt enzyme with values of 50 Hz and 37.5 Hz for the serine and lanthionine ESBs , indicative of an intermediate rate of exchange between two species in equilibrium [ 13 ] . 
It was suggested , for the wild type enzyme , that the species under consideration were different conformers of the ESBs . 
The position of the chemical shift is indicative of the weighted average of the two species in equilibrium , suggesting it lies in favor of the looser bound phosphate in the case of the serine ESB and in favor of the tighter bound phosphate in the case of the lanthionine ESB . 
The line widths are lower for the K120Q mutant enzyme suggesting the two species in equilibrium interconvert at an increased rate compared to wt , but the rate of exchange is still in the intermediate range , and the equilibrium position is identical to wt . 
The species involved are thought to be the open and closed conformations of the enzyme [ 19 ] . 
In summary , the spectral data suggest several changes in the enzyme as a result of substitution of Q for K at position 120 . 
1 ) A shift in the tautomeric equilibrium toward the neutral enolimine is suggested by UV-visible absorbance and visible CD spectra , and to a lesser extent by fluorescence emission . 
Although the equilibrium has shifted toward the enolimine , the shift is not dramatic and the equilibrium is still dominated by the ketoeneamine tautomer . 
2 ) An increase in the rate of interconversion of the open and closed forms of the enzyme is suggested by the decreased line width , compared to wt , of the 31P resonance in the serine and lanthionine ESBs . 
Data reflect the increased flexibility of the K120Q mutant enzyme , which results in an increase in the amount of the enolimine tautomer . 
Lysine 120 is located on the surface of the protein at the active site entrance , and forms a hydrogen bond ( and a charge-dipole interaction ) upon closure of the site , Fig. 1 . 
It is difficult to rationalize a role for K120 other than stabilizing the closed form of the enzyme . 
Taking into account the increase in the enolimine tautomer and increased rate of interconversion of the open and closed forms of the ESBs , data suggest an increase in the amount of the open form of the enzyme at a number of points along the reaction pathway , notably the ESBs . 
3.2. Initial rate studies
Decreases in V/Et , V/KOASEt , and V/KTNBEt reflect decrea-ses in the rate constants for both half reactions . 
A minima where k1 , and k5 are rate constants for binding of reactants , k2 ′ and k6 ' are the net off-rate constants for OAS and TNB from the reactant and product external Schiff base complexes , and k3 and k7 are rate constants for the elimination step in the first half reaction , and release of the product , S-carboxynitrophenyl-L-cysteine ( S-CNP-Cys ) in the second half reactions . 
The net off-rate constant k2 ' includes the steps for formation of the Michaelis complex ( ISB-OAS ) and opening the site to release OAS , while k6 ' includes the elimination of TNB from ESBS-CNP-Cys , the steps for formation of the Michaelis complex ( AA-TNB ) , and opening the site to release TNB . 
Given values of 300 s − 1 and 100 s − 1 from pre-steady state experiments for elimination of the acetoxy group and the 230-fold decrease in V/Et when TNB replaces bisulfide as the nucleophlic substrate , the net rate constant for the second half reaction limits the overall reaction [ 9 ] . 
In addition , the slow step in the first half reaction is the elimination step at saturating OAS , but the net off-rate constant for OAS from the ESB is 67 % the net rate constant for the elimination reaction [ 21 ] . 
The slow step in the second half of the reaction is release of product , even when a slow substrate like 1,2,4-triazole ( V/KE , 6 × 10 − 2 M − 1s − 1 t ) is used as the nuclephilic substrate [ 22 ] . 
( The V/KEt values for bisulfide and TNB are 2 × 107 M − 1s − 1 and 950 M − 1s − 1 , respectively [ 9 ] ) . 
Expressions for the macroscopic rate constants , V/Et , V/KOASEt , and V/KTNBEt are given in Eqs .

Since k7 limits overall , the expression for V/KTNB reduces to the expression on the right in Eq . 
( 8 ) . 
The expressions for KOAS and KTNB are given in Eqs . 
( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .

The 56-fold decrease in V/Et observed for the mutant enzyme , Table 2 , must reflect a decrease in the off-rate constant for release of the product S-CNP-Cys , while the 3-fold decrease in V/KOASEt is consistent with the 3-fold decrease in the rate constant for elimination of the acetoxy group in the first half reaction as shown by pre-steady state experiments . 
Consistent with this explanation , KOAS is decreased 15-fold , in agreement with the estimated 19-fold decrease in the ratio of k7/k3 ( k7 decreases 56-fold , while k3 decreases 3-fold ) . 
The decrease in V/KTNBEt is only about 7-fold , much lower than the 56-fold decrease in V/Et . 
Thus , data suggest a decrease of about 8-fold in the net off-rate constant for TNB from ESBS-CNP-Cys to give the AA and TNB . 
Considering the spectral and kinetic data , the decreased rate of the first half reaction likely reflects an increase in the amount of the open form of ESBOAS , probably giving an increase in the amount of the enolimine tautomer . 
The enolimine tautomer is either not active or much less active compared to the keto-eneamine tautomer [ 15 ] . 
The major effect on the overall reaction is on partitioning of the ESBS-CNP-Cys toward release of either the product S-CNP-Cys or TNB from enzyme . 
The decreased rate of release of S-CNP-Cys is consistent with a significant increase in the amount of the open form of the lanthionine ESB . 
If correct , opening the site stabilizes ESBOAS and ESBS-CNP-Cys , with the largest effect exhibited on ESBS-CNP-Cys . 
The increased rate of release of TNB likely reflects a cumulative effect of generating the open form at a number of points along the reaction pathway . 
Confirmation of the suggested increase in the flexibility of the enzyme will have to await additional expe-riments to monitor the dynamics of the enzyme along its reaction pathway .
