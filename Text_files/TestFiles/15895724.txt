ABSTRACT 
Proteins and genes involved in the recovery of heat-injured Salmonella Enteritidis were investigated . 
Salmonella Enteritidis cells cultured overnight in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ; nonselective medium ) were suspended in citric acid -- disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer ( pH 6 ) . 
After heat treatment at 558C for 15 min , the culturable counts measured by tryptic soy agar ( TSA ; nonselective medium ) decreased from 108 to 107 CFU/ml . 
On the other hand , culturable counts measured by desoxycholate -- hydrogen sulﬁte -- lactose ( DHL ) agar ( selective medium ) were decreased from 108 to 104 CFU/ml by the same treatment . 
The results suggest that 99.9 % of Salmonella Enteritidis detected on TSA were injured but recoverable . 
When injured Salmonella Enteritidis was incubated in TSB , the culturable count measured by TSA did not increase for 2 h , whereas that by DHL agar increased after incubation for 30 min . 
After incubation for 2 h , the culturable count measured by DHL agar reached a similar level with that by TSA , indicating that Salmonella Enteritidis had recovered . 
The two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that elongation factor G ( FusA ) and pyruvate kinase ( PykF ) speciﬁcally increased in the cells just after heat treatment and in the recovery cells . 
The levels of transcription of 86 stress-inducible genes were also investigated by reverse transcription PCR . 
Nineteen heat-inducible ( clpB , clpX , degP , dnaJ , fkpA , ftsJ , gapA , hﬂB , hslJ , hslU , hslV , htpG , htrA , lon , mopA , mopB , mreB , rpoE , and ppiD ) , and 12 oxidative-stress and DNA damage -- inducible ( ahpC , ahpF , ﬂdB , fur , grxA , dinF , katG , mutM , recA , soxR , trxC , and zwf ) genes were transcribed extensively during recovery in TSB . 
The results obtained in this study will be used to develop the media or culture conditions that will promote recovery for the detection of food poisoning bacteria , including injured cells from food products . 
Heat treatment is one of the most common methods of sterilization in food processing . 
In the sterilization of food by heat , the higher the treatment temperature or the longer the treatment time , the higher the sterilization efﬁciency becomes . 
However , such severe heat also results in dena-turation of food materials and reduces the commercial value of the food products . 
On the other hand , mild heat or insufﬁcient heat does not always kill but injures bacterial cells ( 5 ) . 
Injured bacteria have an impaired permeability barrier ( 2 ) or decreased enzymatic activities essential for the maintenance of life ( 35 ) . 
To facilitate detection of speciﬁc bacteria in foods , selective agents such as bile salts , novobiocin , or ceﬁxime are often added to media . 
However , these agents inhibit repair of injured bacteria or even kill them because they are more sensitive to the action of selective agents present in the media ( 3 , 14 , 24 , 38 ) . 
Successful enrichment is a decisive step in the detection of Salmonella . 
Several studies have been done to improve techniques for recovering sublethally injured Salmonella , Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( 10 , 12 , 27 ) . 
However , mechanisms for the recovery of injured bacteria are still unknown . 
Recent studies have revealed the mechanisms and functions of molecular chaperones in detail . 
For E. coli , heat

shock protein ( HSP ) 100/Clp ( 18 ) , HtpG ( 39 ) , DnaK ( 8 ) , GroEL ( 7 ) , ibpA/ibpB ( 36 ) , and Trigger factor ( 31 ) are known as major cytosolic chaperones . 
These chaperones help newly synthesized polypeptide chains fold correctly or help refold denatured proteins . 
Furthermore , these chaperones play important roles in protection against and recovery from injury caused by heat and oxidative stresses . 
Little is known about which chaperones or proteins are responsible for the recovery of Salmonella Enteritidis from injury . 
In this study , injury and recovery of heat-treated Sal-monella Enteritidis were investigated in terms of colony formation , syntheses of proteins , and gene transcription . 
The results obtained in this study will provide valuable information on the design and development of media or culture conditions effective for enrichment of injured Salmo-nella Enteritidis in food products . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
3313 was purchased from the Institute for Fermentation ( Osaka , Japan ) . 
Tryptic soy broth ( TSB ; Becton Dickinson , Sparks , Md. ) was used for preenrichment and recovery of the bacterium . 
Tryptic soy agar ( TSA ; Becton Dickinson ) was used for plating to count total culturable bacteria ( including both intact cells and injured but recoverable cells ) , and desoxycholate -- hydrogen sulﬁte -- lactose ( DHL ) agar ( Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) was used for plate counts of intact bacteria . 
was cultured overnight in TSB at 378C with shaking at 140 rpm to obtain cells in the stationary growth phase . 
The culture was suspended in 240 ml of sterile 50 mM citric acid -- disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer ( pH 6.0 ) in a conical ﬂask ( 500 ml ) to attain bacterial concentrations of approximately 108 CFU/ml .

Heat and recovery treatments of the cell suspension and enumeration of culturable cells . 
The cell suspension was incubated in a water bath at 258C for 10 min before heat treatment in a water bath at 558C with gentle shaking at 70 rpm for 15 min . 
For the recovery treatment , an equal volume ( 160 ml ) of 23 concentrated TSB was mixed with the heated cell suspension and incubated at 378C with shaking at 140 rpm . 
The cell suspensions just after the heat treatment and during recovery ( 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 min and 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 h ) were withdrawn and serially diluted with PBS , and 100 ml of each diluted suspension was spread over TSA and DHL . 
After incubation at 378C for 2 days , colonies were counted . 
As a control , unheated Salmonella Enteritidis was suspended in TSB at 104 CFU/ml and incubated for 8 h to observe the growth of intact Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Preparation of cellular protein . 
After the cell suspension 
( 240 ml ) was preincubated in a water bath at 258C for 10 min , 80 ml of the cell suspension was withdrawn as a control . 
The remaining suspension ( 160 ml ) was heated in a water bath at 558C for 15 min with gentle shaking . 
After the heat treatment , 80 ml of the heated cell suspension was immediately withdrawn as heated cells , and the cell suspension remaining was mixed with 80 ml of 23 TSB and incubated at 378C with shaking at 140 rpm for 1 h to prepare recovery cells . 
Cells of the control , just after heating , and recovery , were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 10 min at 48C , resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mM phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl-ﬂuoride , and stored at 2208C . 
two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 2D-PAGE ) , the O'Farell system ( 23 ) was used . 
The cell suspensions ( 100 ml ) , prepared as described in `` Preparation of bacterial suspension , '' were thawed at 48C and frozen at 2208C again . 
This freeze-thaw treatment was repeated three times . 
After the ﬁnal thawing , 120 mg of urea ( 9.5 M , Nacalai Tesque Inc. , Kyoto , Japan ) , 24 ml of 2 % Nonidet P-40 ( Nacalai Tesque Inc. ) , 9.6 ml of 1.6 % Ampholine , pH 5 to 7 ( Amarsham Biosciences AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) , 2.4 ml of 0.4 % Ampholine , pH 3.5 to 10 ( Amarsham Biosciences AB ) , and 12 ml of 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol ( Nacalai Tesque Inc. ) were added to 100 ml of the suspension . 
The mixture containing 100 mg of protein was put on each gel . 
Before isoelectric focusing , the gels were subjected to pre-electrophoresis to obtain a pH gradient at 200 V for 15 min , 300 V for 30 min , and 400 V for 30 min at 48C . 
Isoelectric focusing was done in rod gels ( 85 mm long by 2.0 mm diameter ) with 4.2 % polyacrylamide containing 8 M urea , 2 % Nonidet P-40 , 1.6 % Ampholine ( pH 5 to 7 ) and 0.4 % Ampholine ( pH 3.5 to 10 ) . 
Isoelectric focusing was run at 200 V for 1 h , 400 V for 12 h , and 800 V for 1 h at 48C . 
After migration , the gels were extruded into 30 ml of deionized water and incubated for 5 min with gentle shaking to remove urea and Nonidet P-40 from the gels . 
Next , the gels were equilibrated in 5 ml of second-dimension sample buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 6.8 ) , 10 % glycerol , 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and 5 % 2-mercaptoethanol for 20 min . 
The gels were then put onto 10 % SDS-PAGE gels ( 1 by 90 by 80 mm ) . 
SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli ( 15 ) . 
The separated proteins were visualized by staining with Coomasie brilliant blue R-250 ( CBB ) . 
The second-dimension gels were analyzed with the use of 
Yab GelImage software ( http://homepage.mac.com/yabyab/rb/gel-image.html ) . 
mg of cellular protein ) was subjected to 2D-PAGE as described above , except that in the second dimension of 2D-PAGE , 0.1 mM sodium thioglycolate was added in SDS-PAGE running buffer ( 0.025 M Tris-HCl , 0.192 M glycine , and 0.1 % SDS ) for better sequence performance . 
Electrotransfer was performed by the method of Towbin ( 35 ) with the following modiﬁcations . 
After electrophoresis , the gels were rinsed in deionized water . 
A ClearBlot Membrane-P ( polyvinylidene diﬂuoride [ PVDF ] membrane , ATTO Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) was dampened with 100 % methanol and equilibrated in the transfer buffer with gentle shaking . 
The gel and a sheet of the PVDF membrane were sandwiched between six sheets of blotting paper soaked in transfer buffer and were assembled into a semidry blotting apparatus ( ATTO Corp. ) . 
Electrotransfer was performed at 2 mA/cm2 for 60 min . 
The PVDF membrane was stained with 0.005 % CBB in 40 % methanol for 15 min and destained in 50 % methanol at room temperature for 20 min with gentle shaking . 
The membrane was then rinsed ﬁve times in deionized water for 5 min , air dried , and stored . 
The membrane areas containing the protein of interest were excised and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was determined with a gas-phase sequencer PSQ-1 system ( Shimadzu Co. , Ltd. , Kyoto , Japan ) . 
To determine the possible identities of proteins , the resulting amino acid sequences were compared with sequences in GenBanK and PIR ( Protein Identiﬁcation Resource database ) with the BlastP program ( 1 ) . 
PCR ) . 
Transcription of 42 heat-inducible genes and 46 oxidative stress -- inducible and DNA damage -- inducible genes was investigated in this study . 
The genes have been described in the literature for E. coli ( 32 ) , and the corresponding genes for Salmonella Typhimurium ( 19 ) have been searched for in the DBGET database . 
The name and origin of the genes and oligonucleotide sequences of primers are listed in Table 1 . 
The primers were designed to amplify about 200-bp DNA fragments downstream of , but very close to , the initiation codon of each gene . 
Cell suspensions of untreated ( 160 ml ) , just after heating ( 160 ml ) , and recovery ( 320 ml ) , were centrifuged at 5,000 3 g for 10 min at 48C , and the pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C . 
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN K.K. , Tokyo , Japan ) according to the manufacturer 's meth-od . 
The puriﬁed RNAs were eluted in RNase-free water , and total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm . 
Reverse transcription reaction was performed with a PC-701 programma-ble temperature control system ( Astec Co. , Ltd. , Fukuoka , Japan ) . 
A mixture of 1.2 mg of puriﬁed RNA dissolved in 10 ml of RNasefree water and 1 ml of 200 pM of each reverse primer was heated at 708C for 10 min to denature the RNA conformation . 
After cooling on ice , 9 ml of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.8 ) , 75 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM DTT ( pH 8.3 ) , 500 mM each of deoxynucleotide triphosphate , and 200 U of ReverScript I ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Ltd. , Osaka , Japan ) was added to the mixture . 
The reaction was started by primer-template annealing at 258C for 10 min and primer extension at 458C for 50 min . 
The reaction was terminated by heating at 708C for 15 min , and the reaction mixture was stored at 2208C . 
PCR was performed with a thermal cycler ( PCR Express Thermal Cycler , Hybaid , Ashford , UK ) . 
The PCR reaction was carried out with a 20-ml mixture containing 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase ( Sigma-Aldrich , Inc. , St. Louis , Mo. ) , 50 mM KCl , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.3 ) , 200 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate , 20 pmol of each of the primers , and 1 ml of the reverse transcription reaction mixture . 
The mixtures were subjected to 20 cycles of ampliﬁcation , consisting of template DNA denaturation at 958C for 1 min , primer-template annealing at 538C for 1 min , and primer extension at 728C for 1 min . 
The genomic DNA ( 0.2 mg ) was used instead of the reverse transcription reaction mixture to provide a positive control to monitor the reaction . 
Sterile water was used instead of template

DNA to provide a negative control to monitor the contamination of external DNA in the PCR reagents in each PCR reaction . 
An aliquot ( 10 ml ) of the PCR reaction mixture was analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 1.5 % agarose gel in 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer ( pH 3.0 ) containing 1 mM EDTA at 3 V/cm2 for 45 min . 
The gel was stained in 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide solution and visualized with a UV transilluminator . 
A 100-bp ladder marker ( New England Bio Labs , Beverly , Mass. ) was used for estimation of the size of the PCR product . 
teritidis . 
After heating at 558C for 15 min , culturable cell counts decreased from 108 to 107 CFU/ml and to 104 CFU / ml , as determined by plating on TSA and DHL agar , respectively , suggesting that 99.9 % of Salmonella Enteritidis cells that formed colonies on TSA were injured but recoverable . 
Figure 1 shows the changes in culturability of heattreated and intact Salmonella Enteritidis during incubation in TSB for 8 h ( Fig. 1a ) . 
During incubation of heat-treated Salmonella Enteritidis , total culturable cell count determined by the plating assay with TSA did not increase for 2 h , whereas that determined by the plating assay with DHL agar increased after 30 min of incubation ( Fig. 1b ) . 
After 2 h of incubation , the culturable cell count on DHL agar ( count of intact cells ) reached a similar level as that on TSA . 
In contrast , culturable counts of unheated Salmonella Enteritidis increased on both TSA and DHL agar after 30 min of incubation ( Fig. 1c ) .

The 2D-PAGE proﬁles of proteins prepared from untreated cells , just after heating , and recovery , are shown in Figure 2 . 
About 150 protein spots could be resolved in this system . 
Changes in seven protein spots are summarized in Table 2 . 
The relative amount of seven proteins changed after the heat treatment . 
Four of the proteins ( spots A , B , C , and F ) increased speciﬁcally in both heattreated cells and recovering cells . 
Two proteins ( spots E and G ) seemed to be induced by heat , but they decreased during recovery . 
The amount of one protein ( spot D ) decreased during recovery in TSB . 
To clarify the functions of the proteins , their N-termi-nal amino acid sequences were analyzed and examined to determine whether they matched those of any known proteins in GenBank or PIR . 
The N-terminal amino acid sequences of two protein spots were determined ( Table 3 ) . 
The 14 -- amino acid sequence obtained from an 82-kDa protein ( spot A ) was found to have 92 % sequence similarity b ( Normalized value in gels just after heating or gels incubated in TSB for 1 h ) / ( normalized value in control gels ) .

DISCUSSION
To clarify the mechanism for recovery of heat-injured Salmonella Enteritidis , changes in culturability , cellular proteins , and gene transcription were investigated . 
After heat treatment of Salmonella Enteritidis at 558C for 15 min , the culturable count determined by the plating assay with TSA , a nonselective medium , was nearly 1,000-fold higher than that determined by the assay with DHL agar , a selective medium . 
The result suggests that 99.9 % of Salmonella Enteritidis detected by the assay with TSA were injured but recoverable . 
During the incubation of heat-treated cells in TSB for 2 h , culturable counts measured by TSA did not increase . 
At 2 h , it was 1.08-fold that at time 0 ( Fig. 1b ) . 
The concentration of intact cells in the suspension was 1,000-fold lower than that of injured cells , which is why proliferation of intact cells was not reﬂected in the culturable counts measured by TSA . 
On the other hand , after incubation for 2 h , the culturable count measured by DHL agar increased 260-fold from the start of incubation ( Fig. 1b ) . 
If this rapid increase in culturable counts was attributed to proliferation of only intact cells , doubling time of the cell was calculated to be 14.9 min . 
In intact cells ( Fig. 1c ) , culturable count measured by DHL agar at 2 h was only 4.49-fold that of the starting of incubation . 
The doubling time was calculated to be 55.5 min for intact cells . 
Immediately after heat treatment of Salmonella Enteritidis at 108 CFU/ml , 10 % of initial cells ( 107 CFU/ml ) were culturable on TSA , but only 0.01 % of initial cells ( 104 CFU/ml ) were culturable on DHL agar . 
During 2 h of incubation in TSB , cells seemed to recover from the injury that made the cells susceptible to the selective reagents in DHL agar , and the culturable counts measured by DHL agar increased rapidly to the same level as that by TSA . 
This conclusion agrees with the report of Ray ( 26 ) . 
The 2D-PAGE analysis revealed that pyruvate kinase ( PykF ) and EF-G ( FusA ) speciﬁcally increased in both cells just after heat treatment and recovery in TSB ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Py-ruvate kinase catalyzes the synthesis of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate in the sugar phosphotransferase system ( 37 ) . 
A lack of PykF leads to a reduction in growth rate ( 6 ) . 
Sodium pyruvate has been reported to be effective in the recovery of injured bacteria such as E. coli . 
Because pyruvic acid is a key substrate for the citric acid cycle and subsequent electron transport system , the increase of PykF in cells just after heating and recovery of cells might facilitate the production of ATP in the electron transport system . 
As an energy source required for the recovery of the injured bacteria , ATP seems most important because many reactions involved in recovery require ATP . 
The function of EF-G is to catalyze ribosome translocation on mRNA through a mechanism that somehow is enhanced by hydro-lysis of ATP by EF-G ( 16 ) . 
Because EF-G is essential for de novo synthesis of proteins , an increase in the amount of 
EF-G could result in the synthesis of other recovery-related proteins . 
The heat-inducible genes in which transcripts speciﬁcally increased in the recovering cells are classiﬁed into the following groups : ( i ) chaperones ( mopA , mopB , dnaJ , htpG ) , which mediate refolding of denatured proteins ; ( ii ) proteases ( clpB , clpX , degP , hﬂB , htrA , lon ) , which degrade aggregated proteins ; ( iii ) isomerases ( fkpA , ppiD ) , which catalyze the refolding of proteins ; and ( iv ) a sigma factor ( rpoE ) . 
Functions of these genes have been described in great detail in other microorganisms ( 30 ) . 
For example , the activation of transcription of rpoE , which encodes sE , leads to the activation of transcription at promoters for fkpA , degP , rpoH ( s32 genes ) , and rpoE itself ( 25 ) . 
Furthermore , a recent study revealed that the promoter of fusA , which encodes EF-G , is also recognized by sE ( 28 ) . 
It seems that an increase in the expression of the rpoE gene induced by heat enhances the expression of fusA during recovery . 
Heat treatment is usually accompanied by oxidative stress . 
The SoxR protein acts as both a sensor and an activator protein against oxidative stress ( 20 ) . 
When it is converted to an active form , SoxR , which increased speciﬁcally in the recovering cells in this study , enhances transcription of soxS and increases the level of SoxR protein , a positive regulator stimulating transcription of superoxide anion -- responsive genes such as zwf , which encodes glucose-6-phos-phate dehydrogenase . 
The transcription of ahpC , encoding the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase small subunit , and ahpF , encoding the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase large subunit , also increased in the recovering cells . 
The translation products of ahpC and ahpF together assemble the alkyl hydro-peroxide reductase ( AhpR ) system ( 13 ) , which converts hydroperoxides like thymine peroxide or linoleic acid peroxide to the corresponding alcohols with NADH or NADPH as a reduction equivalent ( 34 ) . 
Other oxidative stress -- inducible genes that increased in the recovering cells are fur , encoding a global repressor for ferric ion uptake ( 9 ) ; ﬂdB , encoding ﬂavodoxin ( 17 ) ; trxC , encoding thioredoxine II ( 29 ) ; grxA , encoding glutaredoxin I ( 11 ) ; and mutM , encoding formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase ( 21 ) . 
These results suggest that heat treatment results in an increase in reactive oxygen species . 
This agrees with the report that catalase or sodium thiosulfate promotes the recovery of bacteria injured by hydroperoxide ( 22 ) or chlorines ( 4 ) . 
Further research is planned to determine precise expression levels of heat-inducible , oxidative stress -- inducible , and DNA damage -- inducible genes by real-time PCR . 
We have analyzed the factors involved in recovery of heat-injured Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Pyruvate kinase , sE , sE regulons such as EF-G , and reactive oxygen species reduction systems seem to play important roles in the recovery of heat-injured Salmonella Enteritidis , which is susceptible to the action of desoxycholate , as well as major cytosolic chaperones such as DnaK ( 8 ) . 
The results obtained in this study will contribute to the further understanding of mechanisms in the recovery of Salmonella Enteritidis and other food poisoning -- related bacteria during or after food processing . 
The results also will be useful for designing culture media or culture conditions for more reliable detection of injured but recoverable bacteria in food products . 
To promote recovery of injured bacteria , screening of substances and culture conditions that promote the expression of re-covery-related genes , such as pykF , fusA , or sE , would be necessary .
