The Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhi-murium ) genome encodes 12 intestinal colonization factors of the chaperone/usher fimbrial assembly class ; however , the binding specificity is known for only one of these adhesins , known as type 1 fimbriae . 
Here we explored the utility of glycomics to determine the carbohydrate binding specificity of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae from S. Typhimurium . 
A cosmid carrying the pef operon was introduced into Escherichia coli and expression of fimbrial filaments composed of PefA confirmed by flow cytometry and immune-electron microscopy . 
Plasmid-encoded fimbriae were purified from the surface of E. coli , and the resulting preparation was shown to contain PefA as the sole major protein component . 
The binding of purified plasmid-encoded fimbriae to a glycanarray suggested that this adhesin specifically binds the trisaccharide Gal 1 -- 4 ( Fuc 1 -- 3 ) GlcNAc , also known as the Lewis X ( Lex ) blood group antigen . 
Results from the glycanarray were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) in which plasmid-encoded fimbriae bound Lex-coated wells in a concentration-dependent manner . 
The binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to Lex-coated wells could be inhibited by co-incubation with soluble Lex antigen . 
Our results establish glycomic analysis as a promising new approach for determining the carbohydrate binding specificity of bacterial adhesins . 
The Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhi-murium ) 2 genome contains 12 operons encoding type II secretion systems of the chaperone/usher assembly class ( 1 ) . 
These include eight members of the - Fimbriae ( fim , bcf , sti , sth , lpf , saf , stc , and stb ) , one member of the - Fimbriae ( stj ) , two members of the - Fimbriae ( std and stf ) , and one member of the - Fimbriae ( pef ) ( 2 ) . 
However , the binding specificity is known only for type 1 fimbriae , which are encoded by the S. Typhi-murium fim operon ( 3 , 4 ) . 
Type 1 fimbriae mediate mannose ¬

sensitive agglutination of erythrocytes or yeast cells ( 5 ) , because the FimH fimbrial tip adhesin binds terminal - D-mannose res-idues present in host glycoproteins ( 6 -- 10 ) . 
The paucity of data on the binding specificities of chaperone/usher systems is partly due to the fact that , with the exception of type 1 fimbriae , these surface structures are poorly expressed during growth of S. Typhimurium under standard laboratory conditions ( 11 , 12 ) . 
The pef operon is located on the virulence plasmid of S. Typhimurium ( 13 ) . 
Plasmid-encoded fimbriae can not be detected after growth under standard laboratory growth conditions ( 11 , 12 ) , because expression is controlled negatively by the histone-like protein ( H-NS ) , the stationary phase sigma factor ( RpoS ) , and the presence of type 1 fimbrial biosynthesis genes ( fimAICDHF ) ( 2 , 14 ) . 
Although production of the major fimbrial subunit PefA is not detected under laboratory growth conditions , seroconversion of mice infected with S. Typhimurium ( 12 ) and detection of PefA on bacteria recovered from bovineligated ileal loops ( 11 ) provide evidence for in vivo expression of the pef operon . 
Introduction of the cloned pef operon into Esch-erichia coli results in expression of thin ( 2 -- 5 nm in diameter ) flexible fibrillae composed of the major fimbrial subunit PefA ( 13 , 15 ) . 
The ability to express plasmid-encoded fimbriae under laboratory growth conditions makes them well-suited for experiments aimed at characterizing their binding specificity . 
The goal of this study was to explore the utility of using glycanarrays for determining the binding properties of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae . 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions -- E. coli strains BL21 ( DE3 ) and TOP10 were obtained from Stratagene and Invitrogen , respectively . 
The E. coli strain ORN172 carries a fimBEACDFGH : : Km allele and is phenotypically non-fimbri-ate ( 16 ) . 
Bacteria were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani ( LB ) broth ( with shaking ) or on LB agar plates . 
For expression of fimbriae , bacteria were grown statically in LB broth at 37 °C overnight . 
Generation of Anti-PefD Serum -- A DNA region encoding an internal portion of PefD was amplified with primers : 5 - CGGGA-TCCGGCACGCGTTTTATCTATGAGGAAGG-3 and 5-GGAATTCTCACTTCAGCGTGTAGTCCTGGGTG-3 and cloned into the plasmid vector pGEX4T-2 ( 17 ) ( Amersham Biosciences ) to generate pCWD41 , which encodes a PefD-GST fusion protein . 
The PefD-GST fusion protein was purified from E. coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) using affinity chromatography as described previously ( 11 ) . 
Anti-PefD serum was raised in a female New Zealand White rabbit as previously described ( 11 ) . 
Serum was pre-absorbed with E. coli BL21 pGEX4T-2 ( expressing GST ) using a protocol described previously ( 18 ) . 
Flow Cytometry -- Approximately 5 108 cells were incubated with an equal volume of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( EM Science ) at room temperature for 20 min . 
Cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of 0.02 % gelatin in PBS ( PBS-gel ) . 
To block nonspecific binding , cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of filter-sterilized 2 % normal goat serum ( NGS , Sigma ) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a tabletop rotator . 
Polyclonal rabbit anti-PefA serum ( 11 ) was added to the cells at a final dilution of 1:250 for detection of PefA , and cells were incubated at room temperature for 60 min on a tabletop rotator . 
After washing the cells three times in PBS-gel , bacteria were resuspended in 0.5 ml of a solution of 0.04 mM propidium iodide in 2 % NGS with secondary antibody ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG , Jackson ImmunoLabs ) added at a dilution of 1:250 . 
The mixture was rotated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark . 
Samples were washed three times with PBS-gel , and bacteria were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 106 cells/ml . 
For each sample , the fluorescence of 10,000 particles ( bacterial cells ) was measured by flow cytometry ( FACSCalibur ; Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) . 
Purification of Fimbriae -- A non-fimbriate E. coli strain ( ORN172 ) carrying the cloned pef operon ( pFB11 ) ( 15 ) or the cloned fim operon ( pISF101 ) ( 19 ) was grown in two liters of LB broth , harvested by centrifugation , and resuspended in 10 ml of 0.5 mM Tris , 75 mM NaCl . 
Plasmid-encoded fimbriae were separated from the cells by mechanical shearing in a blender for three 1-min periods , after which cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation ( 3,500 rpm , 30 min , 4 °C ) . 
The supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.45-mm filter ( Millipore ) , and ( NH4 ) 2SO4 ( 60 % final concentration ) was added to precipitate the fimbriae . 
Precipitated fimbriae were recovered by centrifugation ( 14,000 rpm , 30 min , 4 °C ) . 
The pellet was resuspended in 50 l of sterile water and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE , Western blot , and electron microscopy . 
Western Blot Analysis -- Polyclonal rabbit anti-PefA serum has been previously described ( 11 ) . 
The serum was diluted 1:5 in PBS , pH 7.4 containing 0.2 % sodium azide and pre-absorbed 8 times ( 18 ) with ORN172-carrying plasmid pGEX-4T-2 ( 17 ) and 4 times with ADH19 ( SR11 pefBACDI : : Km ) . 
Purified fimbriae were disassembled into individual subunits by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) loading buffer for 10 min . 
Bacterial cultures were resuspended to A600 to a concentration of 2 108 colonyforming units ( cfu ) / 10 l in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min to generate cell lysates . 
Cell lysates were then separated by 15 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to Immobilon-P ( Millipore ) membranes using a Trans-Blot semi-dry transfer cell ( Bio-Rad ) , incubated with rabbit anti-PefA serum diluted to 1:500 final , detected with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate and the Immun-Star chemiluminescent substrate ( Bio-Rad ) , and visualized with X-Omat Blue Film ( Kodak ) . 
N-terminal Sequencing -- Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore ) in 10 mM CAPS , 10 % methanol , pH 11.0 using a Trans ¬ 
Blot SD semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell according to standard protocols . 
Following electrophoretic transfer , the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was washed two times in sterile water . 
Transferred protein was visualized by staining with Amido Black solution ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 2 min followed by destaining with 1 % acetic acid . 
N-terminal sequencing of the Pef major subunit was performed by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Texas A&M University using automated Edman chemistry in a Hewlett Packard G1000A Automated Protein Sequencer . 
Electron Microscopy -- For immune-electron microscopy , bacteria were grown in a static culture , washed twice in PBS , and resuspended in EM grade water ( EM Science ) at a titer of 1 109 colony-forming units/ml . 
The bacterial culture ( 10 l ) was allowed to adhere to a formvar/carbon-coated grid ( EM Science ) for 2 min , and grids were incubated for 20 min in a primary antiserum ( rabbit ) diluted 1:250 in PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . 
Grids were washed five times for 1 min in PBS containing 1 % BSA . 
Grids were incubated for 20 min in goat anti-rabbit 10-nm gold conjugate ( EM Science ) , diluted 1:20 in PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . 
Grids were washed three times for 1 min in PBS containing 1 % BSA and three times for 1 min in EM grade water ( EM Science ) before they were analyzed by electron microscopy . 
Purified plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( 10 l ) were visualized by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) by allowing attachment to formvar-coated copper TEM grids for 1 min . 
The purified fimbriae were negatively stained for 1 min using 1 % aqueous ammonium molybdate . 
The grids were allowed to dry before they were analyzed by electron microscopy . 
Glycanarray Analysis -- Glycanarray analysis was performed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics ( CFG ) . 
Streptavi-din-coated high binding capacity black 384-well plates ( Pierce 15513 ) were coated at saturating density ( 60 pmol/well ) with 99 different biotinylated carbohydrate ligands in triplicate ( Glycan-Array version 1.2 ) and washed 3 ( Embla 96/384 Well Washer from Molecular Devices ) with 0.1 ml of wash buffer ( PBS , 0.05 % Tween 20 ) . 
Purified plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( 0.05 ml of a solution containing 0.03 g/ml ) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . 
After three washes ( washing buffer ) , plates were incubated with rabbit anti-PefA serum ( 1:23.5 ) for 1 h at room temperature . 
After three washes , plates were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 conjugate ( 0.025 ml/well of a solution containing 0.05 mg/ml ) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . 
After three washes , wells were loaded with 0.05 ml of PBS , and fluorescence measured at 485/535 nm using the Core H plate reader ( Wallac Victor2 1420 Multi-label Counter from PerkinElmer ) . 
The background signal was determined in wells treated with primary ( rabbit anti-PefA ) and secondary antibody ( goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 ) , but not with plasmid-encoded fimrbiae ( control wells ) . 
The average reading from three wells coated with one biotinylated carbohydrate ligand was divided by the average reading from three control wells . 
Binding that was increased at least 2-fold above background levels was considered significant . 
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) -- EvenCoatTM streptavidin microplates ( R&D Systems ) were coated with Lewis X ( Lex ) - PAA-biotin , D-mannose-PAA-biotin , or HOCH2 ¬ 
( HOCH ) 4CH2NH-PAA-biotin ( GlycoTech ) . 
Streptavidincoated high binding capacity 96-well plates were coated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 l per well of 2 g/liter biotin-conjugated sugar diluted in PBS . 
Serial dilutions of a plasmid-encoded fimbrial preparation were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . 
After washing with PBS plus 0.05 % ( v/v ) Tween 20 ( PBS/T ) , the plate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with PBS/T containing 0.25 % ( w/v ) BSA . 
Then , the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-PefA serum ( 1:500 ) . 
After washing , the plate was incubated another hour at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( 1:1000 ) . 
The reaction was developed with Sigma 4-nitrophenyl phosphate diso-dium salt hexahydrate . 
The resulting color reaction was read at 415 nm with an ELISA microplate reader ( Bio-Rad Model 680 ) . 
Competition assays for determining binding specificity were performed by coating streptavidin microplates ( R&D Systems ) with 2 g/liter Lex-PAA-biotin ( GlycoTech ) in a 100-ml volume as described above . 
Wells were incubated with 2 g/liter of a preparation of plasmid-encoded fimbriae in the presence of increasing concentrations of Lex-PAA or D-mannose-PAA ( GlycoTech ) in a 100 - l volume for 30 min at room temperature . 
Binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to wells was performed with anti-PefA serum and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate as described above . 
RESULTS
Expression and Purification of Plasmid-encoded Fimbriae -- An E. coli fim mutant ( ORN172 ) carrying a cosmid ( pFB11 ) containing the S. Typhimurium pef operon was used to express plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( 15 ) . 
Expression of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae by ORN172 ( pFB11 ) was confirmed using flow cytometry . 
Bacteria were labeled with propidium iodide for detection of DNA and with rabbit anti-PefA serum and goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC conjugate for detection of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae . 
After gating for bacteria ( i.e. for propidium iodide-positive counts ) ( Fig. 1A ) , the gate for detection of PefA was set using E. coli strain ORN172 as a negative control . 
Cells of E. coli strain ORN172 ( pFB11 ) were considered positive for expressing plasmid-encoded fimbriae when their FITC fluorescence intensity exceeded that of all but a small fraction ( less than 1 % ) of the control population of the non-fimbriated parent ( ORN172 ) . 
Using this gate , the expression of plasmid-encoded fimbriae was detected on the surface of 29 % of cells in the ORN172 ( pFB11 ) culture ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Expression of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae is regulated by phase variation ( 14 ) , which provides a plausible explanation as to why expression of PefA was only detected in a fraction of cells in the population . 
A fraction of cells in cultures of ORN172 ( pFB11 ) carried thin flexible fibrillae on their surface ( Fig. 1C ) , which were not detected in cultures of the parent strain ORN172 ( data not shown ) . 
The thin flexible fibrillae expressed by ORN172 ( pFB11 ) could be labeled with rabbit anti-PefA serum and goat anti-rabbit 10-nm gold conjugate ( Fig. 1D ) , but no labeling was observed with the ORN172-negative control ( Fig. 1E ) . 
Furthermore , no labeling was detected in a control experiment detecting surface expression of PefD , a periplasmic chaperone involved in fimbrial assembly , in strain ORN172 ( pFB11 ) using rabbit anti-PefD serum and goat anti-rabbit 10 nm gold conjugate ( Fig. 1F ) . 
Collectively , these data suggested that the thin flexible fibrillae detected on the surface of strain ORN172 ( pFB11 ) were plas-mid-encoded fimbriae of S. Typhimurium . 
Fimbriae were removed from the surface of strain ORN172 ( pFB11 ) by mechanical shearing and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation . 
Inspection of the fimbrial preparation by electron microscopy revealed the presence of fimbrial filaments ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The presence of the PefA fimbrial subunit in the fimbrial preparation was demonstrated by Western blot with anti-PefA serum ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Analysis of proteins present in the fimbrial preparation by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of two major bands with apparent molecular masses of 17 and 10 kDa ( Fig. 2C ) . 
N-terminal sequencing of the 17-kDa band yielded the sequence ANEVTF , which corresponded to residues 22 -- 27 in the PefA primary structure ( Fig. 2D ) . 
Analysis of the PefA primary structure using the SignalP software ( 20 ) predicted the presence of a 21-amino acid signal peptide , whose cleavage would give rise to a mature protein the Gal 1 -- 4 ( Fuc 1 -- 3 ) GlcNAc moiety , also known as the Lewis X ( Lex ) blood group antigen , because various carbohydrates present on the glycanarray were conjugated to biotin via the same linker as Lex ( - O ( CH2 ) 2NH ( O ) ( CH2 ) 5NHC ( O ) - ( CH2 ) 5NHC ( O ) - ) . 
Although binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to the remaining sugars scored below the cutoff value , it should be mentioned that the biotinylated carbohydrate ligand producing the greatest average S/N ratio was tri-Lewis X-biotin ( average S/N ratio 1.65 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Results from the glycanarray experiments thus suggested that Lex is a carbohydrate ligand specifically bound by plasmid-en-coded fimbriae . 
Confirmation of Glycanarray Results -- We next wanted to confirm data from our glycomics screen by performing more detailed binding studies for those interactions that scored positive in the glycanarray . 
Increasing concentrations of plasmid-encoded fimbriae were added to 96-well plates coated with Lex-PAA-biotin , and binding was detected with anti-PefA serum and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to Lex-PAA-biotin-coated wells was concentration-dependent , and saturation was reached with a fimbrial preparation containing 2 g of protein per liter . 
Half-maximal binding was observed at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.01 g/liter of plasmid-encoded fimbriae . 
No binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to wells coated with - D-mannose-PAA-biotin or HOCH2 ( HOCH ) 4CH2NH-PAA-biotin was observed . 
These data further supported the idea that plasmid-encoded fimbriae specifically bind the carbohydrate ligand Lex , thus confirming results from the glycanarray analysis . 
To determine the specificity of Lex binding by plasmid-en-coded fimbriae , we tested the ability of Lex-PAA to inhibit binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to Lex-PAA-biotin-coated wells in a solid phase binding assay ( Fig. 4B ) . 
Plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( 2 g/liter ) were incubated in wells coated with Lex-PAA-biotin in the presence of increasing concentrations of LexPAA . 
Soluble Lex-PAA blocked binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to Lex-PAA-biotin-coated wells in a concentration-dependent fashion . 
Inhibition was observed at Lex-PAA concentrations of 2 g/liter ( which corresponds to concentrations of Lex-polyacrylamide repeat units of 1.8 nM ) . 
In contrast , no inhibition of binding was observed when plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( 2 g/liter ) were incubated in wells coated with Lex-PAA-biotin in the presence of increasing concentrations of - D-mannose-PAA . 
Collectively , solid-based binding studies supported the idea that plasmid-encoded fimbriae spe-cifically bind the Lex blood group antigen , thereby validating results from our glycanarray analysis . 
These data demonstrate that glycanarrays can be an effective tool in determining the carbohydrate binding specificity of intact bacterial fimbrial filaments .

Fimbriae were visualized in ORN172 ( pFB11 ) by negative staining ( C ) or by immune-electron microscopy with anti-PefA serum ( D ) or anti-PefD serum ( F ) . 
A negative control ( ORN172 ) for immune-electron microscopy with anti-PefA serum is shown in E . 
The binding of antiserum was detected using goat anti-rabbit 10-nm gold particles .

The left lane contains standard proteins ( 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 37 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 , and 200 kDa ) . 
D , position of amino acid sequences ( bold font ) determined by N-terminal sequencing of the indicated protein bands ( arrows ) in the PefA primary structure are shown . 
with a molecular mass of 15.3 kDa . 
N-terminal sequencing confirmed cleavage of the predicted signal peptide and identified the 17-kDa band as the mature form of PefA . 
The 10-kDa protein band detected in the fimbrial preparation ( Fig. 2C ) contained the N-terminal sequence PNAQGC , which corresponded to residues 75 -- 80 in the PefA primary structure ( Fig. 2D ) . 
A truncated fragment of PefA containing amino acids 75 -- 172 has a predicted molecular mass of 9.8 kDa , which corresponded well to the apparent molecular mass of 10 kDa detected by SDS-PAGE . 
Thus , N-terminal sequencing provided evidence that the 10-kDa protein band represented a truncated form of PefA . 
Interestingly , the 10-kDa band was not detected by Western blot analysis with anti-PefA serum ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Collectively , our data suggested that preparations of plas-mid-encoded fimbriae were composed predominantly of a single protein , PefA . 
These results identified PefA as the major fimbrial subunit of plasmid-encoded fimbriae . 
Like other members of the - Fimbriae , the pef operon does not encode a tip adhesin ( 2 ) . 
Screening for Carbohydrate Ligands of Plasmid-encoded Fimbriae using Glycanarrays -- The preparation of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae was allowed to bind to streptavidin-coated 384-well plates in which triplicate wells had each been coated with one of 99 different biotinylated carbohydrate ligands . 
Carbohydrates present on the glycanarray are shown in Table 1 . 
The binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to wells was detected using rabbit anti-PefA serum and goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 conjugate . 
The background signal was determined in wells treated with primary ( rabbit anti-PefA ) and secondary antibody ( goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 ) , but not with plasmid-encoded fimbriae ( control wells ) . 
For each biotinylated carbohydrate ligand , the average signal from three wells was determined and divided by the average background noise detected in three control wells ( average S/N ratio ) . 
By analogy to procedures commonly used during analysis of DNA microarrays , we used a 2-fold increase in the average S/N ratio as an arbitrary cutoff for scoring binding to a biotinylated carbohydrate ligand as positive . 
Glycanarray analysis revealed that binding of plasmid-en-coded fimbriae to wells scored positive for only a single bio-tinylated carbohydrate ligand , Gal 1 -- 4 ( Fuc 1 -- 3 ) GlcNAc-O ( CH2 ) 2NH ( O ) ( CH2 ) 5NHC ( O ) ( CH2 ) 5NHC ( O ) - Biotin ( average S/N ratio 2.41 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These data suggested binding to 
DISCUSSION
The human blood group antigens are defined by the presence of glycosphingolipids on the surface of erythrocytes , which carry characteristic terminal ends in their saccharide chains . 
In addition to their presence on erythrocytes , blood group antigens are abundant in epithelia of skin and mucosal surfaces

The above considerations suggest that some of the 12 chap-erone/usher-type fimbrial operons present in the S. Typhi-murium genome may encode adhesins that bind human blood group antigens . 
Our finding that plasmid-encoded fimbriae bind the Lex blood group antigen represents the first evidence supporting this concept for the human pathogen S. Typhi-murium . 
The Lex antigen is defined by the presence of a terminal Gal 1 -- 4 ( Fuc 1 -- 3 ) GlcNAc-R moiety on saccharide chains of glycoproteins or glycosphingolipids . 
In the human intestine , the Lex histo-blood group antigen is expressed mainly by crypt epithelial cells ( 21 ) . 
Studies in bovine-ligated ileal loops show that S. Typhimurium initiates infection by invading epithelial cells at the tips of absorptive villi and in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer 's patches ( 25 , 26 ) . 
However , these surfaces rapidly become unavailable , because the ensuing inflammatory reaction leads to necrosis of the uppermost mucosa , while the crypt epithelium remains intact ( 27 ) . 
Abundant crypt abscesses are commonly found in S. Typhimurium patients ( 28 , 29 ) , thus raising the possibility that the pathogen may bind to human crypt epithelium at later stages of infection . 
Our finding that S. Typhimurium possesses an adhesin that binds a crypt-specific histo-blood group antigen may thus be relevant to the pathogenesis of human infections .
