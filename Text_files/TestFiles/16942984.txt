gens resulting in 39 % of 15,600 laboratory-diagnosed infections in 2003 ( CDC , 2004 ) . 
A majority of cases of human salmonellosis are due to the consumption of contaminated egg , poultry , pork , beef , and milk products . 
Conventional culture methods used for the detection of Salmonella include non-selective preenrichment , followed by enrichment and plating on selective and differential agars . 
Suspect colonies are conﬁrmed biochemically and serologically , possibly taking up to 7 days to complete the entire procedure . 
More recently , a number of rapid methods for detection of Salmonella in foods have been developed including immuno-assays , nucleic acid hybridization , and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) techniques ( Li et al. , 2000 ) . 
PCR assays for the rapid , sensitive , and speciﬁc detection of Salmonell have targeted genes such as invA ( Chen et al. , 1997a , b ; Oliveira et al. , 2002 ; Eyigor et al. , 2002 ; Eyigor and Carli , 2003 ; Hong et al. , 2003 ) , the 16S rRNA gene ( Trkov and Avgustin , 2003 ; Hong et al. , 2003 ; Lin et al. , 2004 ) , agfA ( Doran et al. , 1993 ) , virulence associated plasmid ( Rexach et al. , 1994 ) , viaB ( Hashimoto et al. , 1995 ) , and sefA ( Szabo and Mackey , 1999 ; Oliveira et al. , 2002 ; Medici et al. , 2003 ) . 
Most PCR assays employ either visual scoring of the ampliﬁcation product by ethidium bromide stained agarose gels or post-PCR hybridization-capture methods that are labor intensive , time-consuming , and difﬁcult to automate . 
To overcome some of these concerns , we recently modiﬁed a commercially available , Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical Chemists ( AOAC ) - approved , PCR-based method ( Bailey , 1998 ) for real-time monitoring by including the ﬂuorescent dye SYBR Green I ( Bhagwat , 2003 , 2004 ) . 
Although this modiﬁcation enabled simultaneous and rapid detection of three foodborne patho-gens in a high-throughput format , the ﬂuorogenic reporter dye lacked speciﬁcity for the desired target molecule . 
Therefore , post-PCR melting curve analysis of the ampliﬁed product was incorporated in the protocol , and spurious ampliﬁcation products were easy to distinguish ( Bhagwat , 2004 ) . 
However , a new ﬂuorogenic PCR-based format has been recently developed which utilizes an internal ﬂuorogenic probe that is speciﬁc to the target gene ( Chen et al. , 2000 ; Hoorfar et al. , 2000 ) . 
During the PCR assay , the target gene is ampliﬁed and simultaneously recognized and monitored by the ﬂuorescent probe moiety ( Tyagi and Kramer , 1996 ) . 
There are two types of ﬂuorogenic PCR-based detection methods . 
One of the assay utilizes the 50 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase to hydrolyse an internal ﬂuorogenic probe for monitoring ampliﬁcation of DNA target ( referred to as TaqMan assay ) ( Chen et al. , 1997a ; Hoorfar et al. , 2000 ; Rodriguez-Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) , while the other like iQ-Check system ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) utilizes a ﬂuorogenic probe which has ﬂanking GC-rich arm sequences complementary to one another ( Tyagi and Kramer , 1996 ; Chen et al. , 2000 ; Liming and Bhagwat , 2004 ) ( referred as molecular beacon , MB ; Fig. 1 ) . 
In both types of real-time PCR probes , a ﬂuorescent moiety is conjugated to one end of the sequence , and a quencher moiety is attached to the other end of the sequence . 
In the absence of target DNA sequences , the MB assumes a hairpin conformation , with the two arms hybridizing to each other , thus bringing the quencher into close proximity to the ﬂuorophore ( which results in no or low background ﬂuorescence ) . 
When the target DNA is present , the sequence in the loop region hybridizes , the hairpin of the MB opens , and the ﬂuorophore and the quencher separate . 
In the open conformation , the ﬂuorophore of the MB emits a detectable signal that is directly correlated with the quantity of the target template present in the PCR assay ( Tyagi and Kramer , 1996 ; McKillip and Drake , 2004 ) . 
The TaqMan assay differs from the MB method in that the generation of the ﬂuorophore signal is dependent upon 50-30-nuclease activity to cleave the reporter dye from the linear probe ( Kimura et al. , 1999 ; Nogva and Lillehaug , 1999 ) . 
Hydrodynamic pressure ( HDP ) processing is a relatively new , non-thermal process that was developed at the Food Technology and Safety Laboratory ( Belts-ville , MD , USA ) for improving meat tenderness ( Solomon , 1998 ) . 
Supersonic -- hydrodynamic shockwaves generated during HDP treatment disrupt the myoﬁbrillar proteins of the meat muscle ( Zuckerman and Solomon , 1998 ) . 
HDP treatment was successfully utilized to signiﬁcantly improve the tenderness of early deboned chicken breasts ( Meek et al. , 2000 ; Claus et al. , 2001 ) . 
Additionally , HDP treatment was also effective in reducing spoilage bacteria in ground beef and stew pieces ( Williams-Campbell and Solomon , 2000 , 2002 ) . 
However , the effect of HDP in reducing pathogenic bacteria in meat is yet to be elucidated . 
Further , cells injured due to high pressure may remain viable but not culturable by rapid microbiological assays and therefore impart false-negative results ( Chen et al. , 1997a , b ) . 
Under favorable environmental conditions , these injured cells undergo repair , become functionally normal , and compromise the food safety . 
A rapid , sensitive assay for detection of very low levels of healthy or HDP-injured pathogenic Salmonella would be beneﬁcial to the poultry industry . 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a real-time , rapid , sensitive MB probe PCR assay in detecting Salmonella in HDP-treated chicken inoculated at the level of 2 cfu/25 g . 
The MB-PCR assay was compared with standard USDA microbiological procedure for correlation .

Abstract 
A real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay was evaluated to detect Salmonella in hydrodynamic pressure ( HDP ) - treated chicken using molecular beacon probes available as a commercial kit ( iQ-Check , Bio-Rad Laboratories ) . 
The sensitivity and accuracy of the assay were compared with the conventional USDA microbiological procedure using artiﬁcially contaminated minced chicken . 
Chicken ﬁllets were irradiated at 10 kGy to completely destroy any naturally occurring Salmonella . 
These ﬁllets were minced and inoculated with as low as 271 cfu of S. typhimurium per 25 g chicken . 
The minced chicken samples were vacuum packed in multi-layer barrier bags , heat shrunk , and treated with HDP . 
Results showed that all inoculated samples ( n 1/4 36 ) were detected by the PCR assay and conventional USDA procedure . 
Similarly , all uninoculated controls ( n 1/4 11 ) were negative by both PCR assay and USDA procedure . 
As few as 271 cfu could be detected from 25 g HDP-treated chicken following 16 -- 18 h enrichment in buffered peptone water . 
Real-time PCR proved to be an effective method for Salmonella detection in HDP-treated chicken with high sensitivity and more importantly , a rapid and high-throughput detection in 18 h , compared to 3 -- 8 days for the conventional microbiological methods . 
HDP treatment , which has been reported to reduce spoilage bacteria in various meats , was unable to kill pathogenic Salmonella in minced chicken .

Introduction 
Salmonellosis is one of the most frequent foodborne diseases , being an important public health problem in almost all industrialized countries ( D'Aoust , 1997 ) . 
Salmonella is responsible for more than 1 million outbreaks , resulting in 500 + deaths every year in the United States ( Mead et al. , 1999 ) , and is the leading causative agent among nine foodborne bacterial patho ¬

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strain and media
Salmonella typhimurium strain ( MT 2195 ) lacking DNA adenine methylase ( Dam mutant , Heithoff et al. , 1999 ) was used in the study . 
This Dam mutant strain is non-pathogenic in nature which permitted us to carry out HDP treatment in open atmosphere using plastic explosive container ( PEC ) . 
The strain was maintained in tryptic soy broth ( TSB , Difco Laboratories , Detroit , MI , USA ) containing 10 % glycerol ( Difco ) and stored at 801C . 
Frozen cultures were partially thawed at room temperature ( 22 -- 23 1C ) for 15 min , streaked on Tryptic soy agar slants ( Difco ) , and incubated at 37 1C for 24 h. Following overnight incubation , a loopful of growth was transferred to 10 ml LB Miller broth ( Difco ) containing 100 mM morpholinethanesulfonic acid ( Amresco Inc. , Solon , OH , USA ) , at pH 5.5 and incubated at 37 1C with shaking at 200 rpm for 20 -- 22 h to obtain stationary-phase cultures ( Chen et al. , 2004 ) . 
Cells obtained after at least two successive transfers as described above were resuspended in phosphate buf-fered saline ( PBS , 50 mM ) and adjusted to a cell density of 10 cells ml ( 1 o.d. at 600 nm ) using a UV-2501 PC 8 1 spectrophotometer ( Shimadzu Corp. , Japan ) . 
Cells were further diluted to obtain desired cell populations for inoculation into minced chicken . 
Cell concentrations were conﬁrmed by spot plating on LB Miller agar ( Difco ) . 
2.2. Sample preparation and inoculation
Chicken breast ﬁllets obtained from a local retailer were vacuumed packed and irradiated at 10 kGy ( Food Technology Service Inc. , Mulberry , FL , USA ) to inactivate any indigenous Salmonella and stored frozen at 20 1C . 
Total microbial populations of irradiated chicken prior to Salmonella inoculation were nondetectable . 
Fillets ( 500 g ) were thawed overnight and minced with a sterile knife . 
Minced chicken ( 100 g ) was inoculated with as few as 10 Salmonella cells from serially diluted bacterial cultures ( 200-ml PBS ) . 
Higher inoculation levels ( 2 log cfu g 1 10 ) were also used to determine the reduction in Salmonella populations , if any , following the HDP treatment . 
Each experiment was repeated four times with two samples per treatment . 
2.3. Hydrodynamic pressure processing
Samples for HDP treatment were vacuum packed in Cryovac B620T bags ( Sealed air Corp. ) . 
The sealed bag containing the samples was vacuum packed again in a multi-layer barrier bag ( Cryovac BH620T bags , Sealed Air Corp. , Duncan , SC , USA ) , and heat shrunk in hot water ( 88 1C ) for 1 -- 2 s. HDP was performed in a suspended 98-l PEC using 50 g binary explosive that was immersed in the water 30.5 cm away from the surface of the chicken samples . 
A 1.3 cm thick ﬂat steel reﬂecting plate was used to support the chicken samples on the bottom of the PEC . 
To create an air boundary around the PEC , it was suspended 25 cm above the ﬂoor . 
2.4. Conventional procedure
The USDA protocol for isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella from meat , poultry , and egg products ( USDA , 2002 ) was followed . 
Brieﬂy , a 25 g chicken sample was placed into a sterile stomacher bag containing a ﬁlter ( Microbiology International , Frederick , MD , USA ) and diluted with 225 ml buffered peptone water ( BPW , Difco , MI , USA ) , using an automatic diluter ( Dilumat 3 , AES Laboratoire , France ) and pummeled for 2 min with a BagMixer ( Interscience , France ) . 
s After preenrichment for 20 -- 24 h at 35 1C , 0.5 and 0.1 ml of the preenriched samples were transferred to 10 ml tetrathionate broth ( TT Hajna , Difco , MI , USA ) and 10 ml Rappaport-Vassuliadis R10 broth ( Difco ) , respectively . 
Broth tubes were incubated at 42 1C for 22 -- 24 h , then streaked on Brilliant Green Sulfa ( BGS , Difco ) and Xylose Lysin Tergitol 4 agar ( XLT4 , Difco , MI , USA ) . 
Plates were incubated at 35 1C for 18 -- 24 h . 
The identities of suspect Salmonella colonies on BGS and XLT4 agar were conﬁrmed by the Salmonella Latex Test ( Oxoid Ltd. , UK ) . 
To determine the lethal effect of HDP on Salmonella in chicken , samples inoculated with 2 log10 cfu g 1 were immediately analysed following HDP treatment . 
Chicken samples ( 25 g ) were mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 % peptone water , pummeled for 2 min in a BagMixer ( Interscience ) , and spread plated on XLT4 s agar ( Difco ) . 
Bacterial colonies with characteristic Salmonella morphology were enumerated after an incubation of 24 h at 35 1C . 
2.5. Cell lysis and PCR preparation
Chicken samples ( 25 g ) were enriched in BPW for 18 h at 37 1C as recommended by the manufacturer of the iQ-Check Salmonella kit ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 
Following incubation , 1 ml was withdrawn from the top layer without disturbing the food debris and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm ( 18,500 g ) for 5 min . 
After discarding the supernatant , the pellet was suspended in 200-ml lysis buffer ( Bio-Rad ) and vortexed . 
Lysis was carried out by incubating the suspension at 100 1C for 15 min in a dry-block heater ( VWR International Inc. , Bridgeport , NJ , USA ) . 
DNA from pure cultures were prepared by mixing serially diluted 24 h cultures of S. typhimurium MT 2195 ( 10 ml ) containing known quantities of viable cell 
( measured as cfu ml ) with 90-1 ml lysis buffer ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Four sets of Salmonella culture dilutions varying from 2.2 log10 cfu to 6.2 log10 cfu ml , corresponding to 1 1 -- 8200 cfu PCR reaction were used . 
Lysis was carried 1 out as described above and used as a standard in PCR assays . 
2.6. PCR conditions and ampliﬁed product detection
Lysed samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm ( 18,500 g ) for 5 min . 
For each sample , 5 ml of initial and 1:10 diluted DNA was mixed with 40 ml of ampliﬁcation mixture and 5 ml of ﬂuorogenic oligonucleotide MB probe labeled with FAM at the 50-end and DABCYL at the 30-end as the quencher . 
The ﬂuorogenic MB probe from iQ-Check Salmonella kit ( Bio-Rad TM Laboratories ) targets the iagA ( invasion associated gene ) which is highly speciﬁc to Salmonella species ( Miras et al. , 1995 ) . 
To monitor for successful DNA ampliﬁcation in each reaction tube , kit provides a synthetic DNA as a part of the reaction mixture which works as an ` internal control ' . 
This control was ampliﬁed with a speciﬁc probe at the same time as the Salmonella DNA sequence , and detected by a second ﬂuorophore ( Texas Red ) . 
The thermocycler ( iCycler , Bio-Rad Laboratories ) was programmed for 50 1C for 2 min , 95 1C for 5 min , 95 1C for 20 s , 55 1C for 30 s , 72 1C for 30 s ) 50 cycles , and 72 1C for 5 min . 
Data were collected after each annealing step using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm as speciﬁed by the manufacturer ( Bio-Rad ) .

Salmonella populations survived in minced chicken following HDP treatment are shown in Table 1 . 
Initial populations in minced chicken were in the range of 1.98 -- 2.22 log10 cfu g which were reduced to 1 1.70 -- 1.95 log10 cfu g following HDP treatment .

Salmonella reduction after HDP treatment was marginal ( 0.2 -- 0.3 log10 cfu ) and practically insigniﬁcant . 
3.2. Sensitivity of Salmonella speciﬁc PCR assay
We examined the sensitivity of a real-time MB-PCR method using dilutions of 24 h pure cultures of S. typhimurium MT 2195 . 
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between cell populations and the efﬁciency of detection ( measured as threshold cycle value , Ct ) . 
Ct values can be deﬁned as the cycle at which a signiﬁcant increase in ﬂuorescence is ﬁrst recorded . 
The Ct value increased as the number of the available template DNA molecules decreased . 
The ﬁgure shows a strong linear relationship between the log number of cells and Ct values with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.94 . 
As low as 1 cfu of Salmonella per PCR reaction was detected using the assay . 
3.3. Detection of Salmonella in HDP-treated chicken
The sensitivity of real-time iQ-Check PCR for TM detecting very low number of Salmonella in HDP-treated minced chicken was studied . 
Fig. 3 shows the normalized ﬂuorescence measurements from the MB probe values ( relative ﬂuorescence units , RFU ) versus PCR cycle collected in real time . 
Fluorescence from the MB probe ( RFU ) increased as the target DNA ( iagA ) accumulated at the end of each successive round of ampliﬁcation . 
Data collected during the 30-s annealing cycle were used to quantify target DNA ampliﬁcation . 
In artiﬁcially contaminated chicken samples , Ct value increased as the initial number of the template DNA molecules decreased , similar to the pure cultures . 
Thus , Ct values could be used to quantify target DNA molecules and subsequently cell populations in the PCR reaction mix . 
The MB real-time PCR assay and conventional USDA procedure were performed in parallel for each sample . 
Uninoculated chicken samples served as controls . 
There was no difference in Ct values of untreated and HDP-treated chicken samples ( 18.9271.66 and 20.2072.54 , respectively ) inoculated at 271 cfu/25 g. Similar results were found at other inoculation levels ( Table 2 ) . 
Both protocols were able to detect S. typhimurium at low levels of inoculations ( 271 cfu in 25 g chicken ) in all samples tested . 
However , it took 3 -- 5 days to obtain conﬁrmatory results using the conventional USDA protocol compared to 18 h using the PCR assay . 
4. Discussion
4.1 . 
Effect of HDP treatment on Salmonella in chicken 
The Salmonella reduction in minced chicken following the HDP treatment was 0.2 -- 0.3 log10 cfu . 
It seems that lethal effect of HDP treatment on spoilage or patho-genic bacteria in food is not adequately deﬁned . 
We investigated the efﬁcacy of HDP treatment to reduce pathogenic Salmonella in minced chicken as the treatment has shown potential to signiﬁcantly reduce the total plate counts in fresh ground beef ( Williams-Campbell and Solomon , 2002 ) and intact beef muscle ( Schilling et al. , 2003 ) . 
However , Lorca et al. ( 2002 ) did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in coliform or Escherichia coli populations in ground beef following HDP treatment generated by electric arc . 
Hydrostatic pressure processing ( HPP ) is another technology which utilizes very high pressure for cold pasteurization of foods . 
The HPP technology is being studied due to its ability to kill and injure microbial cells in various foods ( Farkas and Hoover , 2000 ; Ray , 2002 ) . 
Yuste et al. ( 2003 ) reported 3 log10 reduction of S. typhimurium in minced chicken following HPP treatment at 400 MPa for 1 min ; however , the reduction was not signiﬁcant ( 0.2 log10 cfu ) when treated at 200 MPa for 5 min . 
The shock waves generated during HDP treatments are much lower ( 70 -- 100 MPa ) for fractions of milliseconds ( Williams-Campbell and Solomon , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , the shock waves may not be strong enough in the magnitude and the duration to have lethal effect on S. typhimurium .

4.2. Real-time assay sensitivity
Application of PCR for the detection of pathogens in food samples is often limited by the presence of substances that inhibit the PCR reaction , poor quality of target DNA , or insufﬁcient enrichment of target DNA ( Rossen et al. , 1992 ; Chen et al. , 1997a ; Heller et al. , 2003 ) . 
Chen et al. ( 1997a ) suggested another centrifugation step of template DNA just prior to use in PCR to better remove PCR inhibitors and ﬂuorescent contaminants . 
More cell debris and protein particles could be further removed from raw milk and chicken carcass rinse samples using additional centrifugation step . 
Soumet et al. ( 1997 ) suggested an enrichment step or an immuno-magnetic separation with additional enrichment to overcome false-negative results of Salmo-nella detection in chicken products . 
However , immunomagnetic concentration of preenriched chicken samples was not advantageous in purifying Salmonella DNA ( Medici et al. , 2003 ) . 
We followed the procedure described by Liming and Bhagwat ( 2004 ) , who recommended enrichment in BPW and taking samples without disturbing the media at the end of the enrichment to keep the inhibition minimum . 
The PCR-ELISA assay for Salmonella yielded 5.0 % false positives and 8.3 % false negatives based on the assumption that the culture method is the standard for detection ( Hong et al. , 2003 ) . 
Kurowski et al. ( 2002 ) reported 100 % relative sensitivity with culture methods using multiple probes in PCR assay ; however , the detection limit in the fecal sample was 230 organisms . 
Our MB-PCR assay had 100 % agreement with the conventional USDA procedure with 11 negative ( uninoculated ) and 36 positive samples . 
To date , culture techniques are universally recognized as the standard methods for the detection of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella in foodstuffs . 
In theory , these methods are capable of detecting as few as one viable cell in a food sample following pre - and selective enrichment stages . 
Increased sensitivity of PCR assays has been reported for the detection of Salmonella , and is attributed to the fact that PCR can detect target sequences , irrespective of the growth potential of target cells ( Chen et al. , 1997a ; Bailey , 1998 ; Whyte et al. , 2002 ; Eyigor and Carli , 2003 ) . 
PCR assay is usually more sensitive than the culture method because : ( 1 ) Salmo-nella with atypical biochemical proﬁles may not detected by culture methods but detectable by PCR assay ; ( 2 ) lethally injured or dead cells may not be culturable but detected by PCR assay ; and ( 3 ) growth of target cells may be prevented by the presence of other bacteria that can compete with Salmonella during preenrichment .

4.3. Detection limits
The detection sensitivity of real-time PCR to detect Salmonella in artiﬁcially inoculated poultry samples was 6 cfu ml ( Eyigor et al. , 2002 ) ; however , the researchers 1 used a selective enrichment step that could have affected the recovery of injured cells . 
Chen et al. ( 1997a ) were able to detect 3 cfu in 25 g food samples using a ﬂuorogenic TaqMan probe . 
In their study , PCR TM assay detected more positive samples than the modiﬁed semi-solid Rappaport-Vassiliadis ( MSRV ) culture meth-od . 
This may be due to the inability of injured cells to grow in MSRV medium or presence of a non-motile Salmonella strain not detected by MSRV method . 
Whyte et al. ( 2002 ) were able to detect as few as 10 cells without a DNA extraction step . 
Lin et al. ( 2004 ) tried to shorten the enrichment time so that the test could be completed in 1 day . 
While they were able to detect Salmonella in inoculated chicken meat after 8 h of enrichment , the sensitivity of the assay was 1 cfu g . 
1 With the MB-PCR procedure , we were able to detect 2 cfu in 25 g chicken samples following 18 h preenrichment . 
Lack of background ﬂora in irradiated chicken might have contributed to the increased PCR sensitivity in our study . 
Bacterial pathogens are expected to be injured or inactivated by high-pressure treatment , depending on the pressure levels , species , and strain of the micro-organism . 
Major injury , where the pathogen could form colonies on non-selective medium but not on selective medium ( Bozoglu et al. , 2004 ) could give false-negative results . 
To permit the recovery of HDP-treated injured cells , if any , we used a preenrichment step with BPW ( USDA , 2002 ) that could allow the repair of any injured cells and subsequent detection by the PCR assay . 
The MB-PCR assay could be used as a valuable tool in screening the large number of samples for Salmonella in poultry .
