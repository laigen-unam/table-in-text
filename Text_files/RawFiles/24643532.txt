Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is associated with a disseminated febrile illness in humans , termed typhoid fever , while Sal-monella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes localized gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals . 
One of the genetic differences between both pathogens is the presence in S. Typhi of TviA , a regulatory protein that shuts down ﬂagellin ( FliC ) expression when bacteria transit from the intestinal lumen into the intestinal mucosa . 
Here we investigated the consequences of TviA-mediated ﬂagellum gene regulation on ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cell responses in a mouse model of S. Typhimurium infection . 
Introduction of the S. Typhi tviA gene into S. Typhimurium suppressed antigen presentation of dendritic cells to ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells in vitro . 
Furthermore , TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellin expression impaired the activation and proliferation of naive ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells in Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes , which was accompanied by increased bacterial dissemination to the spleen . 
We conclude that TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellin expression reduces antigen availability , thereby weakening ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cell responses . 
The genus Salmonella comprises a group of pathogens associated with human illnesses ranging from localized gastroenteritis to disseminated febrile illness , termed typhoid fever ( reviewed in reference 1 ) . 
The causative agent of typhoid fever , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , is strictly human adapted , and the resulting lack of suitable animal models has limited studies on its pathogenesis . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium causes disseminated infection in mice , which is commonly used to model typhoid fever ( reviewed in reference 2 ) . 
However , S. Typhimurium does not cause typhoid fever in humans but instead is associated with localized gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals ( reviewed in reference 3 ) . 
Thus , genetic differences between S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi must account for the fact that the former pathogen is associated with localized enteric infection in humans while the latter disseminates to cause typhoid fever ( 4 , 5 ) . 
An understanding of how relevant genetic differences between S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi inﬂuence the outcome of host-pathogen interactions will be required for a full comprehension of typhoid fever pathogenesis . 
One relevant genetic difference is the presence in S. Typhi of Salmonella pathogenicity island 7 ( SPI7 ) , a large DNA region that is absent from the S. Typhimurium genome ( 6 ) . 
Located on SPI7 is the viaB locus , composed of a regulatory gene , tviA , and an adjacent operon formed by the tviBCDE and vexABCDE genes . 
TviA is a positive regulator of the tviBCDE vexABCDE operon , which encodes functions for the biosynthesis and the export of the virulence-associated ( Vi ) capsular polysaccharide of S. Typhi ( 7 , 8 ) . 
Expression of the Vi capsular polysaccharide alters host-patho-gen interactions by preventing complement deposition ( 9 , 10 ) and by blunting the induction of proinﬂammatory host responses during infection ( 11 -- 14 ) . 
However , the role of TviA during hostpathogen interactions is not limited to its function as a positive regulator of Vi capsular polysaccharide expression . 
Osmoregulation prevents the expression of TviA in the intes-tinal lumen , but the expression of this regulatory protein rapidly commences when bacteria encounter tissue osmolarity during epithelial cell invasion ( 15 -- 17 ) . 
Once available , TviA engages the response regulator RcsB as an auxiliary protein , thereby activating Vi capsular polysaccharide expression while repressing the expression of genes located outside SPI7 , including those involved in ﬂagellum-mediated motility and epithelial cell invasion ( 15 , 18 , 19 ) . 
As a result , S. Typhi rapidly becomes nonmotile , noninvasive , and capsulated during its transition through the intestinal epithelium into mucosal tissue ( 16 , 20 ) . 
While the above-mentioned data suggest that S. Typhi is non-ﬂagellated when it resides in intestinal tissue , ﬂagella are expressed by S. Typhimurium in Peyer 's patches ( 21 ) . 
How does this difference in ﬂagellum expression between S. Typhi and S. Typhimu-rium affect the outcome of host-pathogen interactions ? 
One of the consequences of TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellum gene expression is the evasion of innate immune surveillance by Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) ( 22 ) . 
However , the ﬂagellar ﬁlament protein FliC ( ﬂagellin ) is also a major target of the adaptive immune response , as illustrated by the fact that a signiﬁcant fraction of S. Typhimurium-speciﬁc CD4 T cells generated during natural infection respond to this antigen ( 23 , 24 ) . 
The goal of this study was to determine whether TviA-mediated gene regulation diminishes the development of mucosal FliC-speciﬁc CD4 T cell responses during infection .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and culture conditions . 
All Salmonella strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Unless noted otherwise , Salmonella strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( 10 g/liter tryptone , 5 g/liter yeast extract , 10 g/liter NaCl ) or on LB agar plates ( 15 g/liter agar ) . 
For optimal expression of tviA , strains were ﬁrst cultured in LB broth for 16 h , diluted 1:50 in tryptone-yeast extract ( TYE ) broth ( 10 g/liter tryptone , 5 g/liter yeast extract ) , and incubated aerobically at 37 °C for another 3 h , as described previously ( 15 ) . 
When appropriate , growth medium was supplemented with chloramphenicol at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.03 mg/ml , kanamycin at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.05 mg/ml , and nalidixic acid at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.01 mg/ml . 
The turbidity of bacterial cultures was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm after dilution in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7.4 ) . 
Determination of gene transcription . 
Salmonella strains were cultured as described above in TYE broth for 3 h . 
A volume of 1 ml of bacterial culture was centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C , and the supernatant was discarded . 
RNA was isolated by using the Aurum Total RNA minikit ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The DNA-free kit ( Life Technologies ) was used to minimize DNA contamination . 
cDNA was generated from 0.1 g of RNA by using murine leukemia virus ( MuLV ) reverse transcriptase and reverse tran-scription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) reagents ( Life Technologies ) ( 22 ) . 
As a control , a mock reaction with a mixture lacking the reverse transcriptase was performed to detect DNA contamination . 
SYBR green-based real-time PCR was performed ( 22 ) with the primers listed in Table 2 . 
Data were analyzed by employing the comparative threshold cycle ( CT ) method , normalizing ﬂiC and ﬂjB transcription to 16S rRNA levels . 
The murine cell line JAWSII , obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC CRL-11904 ) , was routinely passaged in complete growth medium consisting of alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with ribonucleosides , deoxyribonucleosides , 4 mM L-glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Life Technologies ) , 5 ng/ml murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( PeproTech ) , and 20 % fetal bo-vine serum ( Life Technologies ) . 
For infection experiments , cells were seeded at a density of 1 105 cells per well into a 24-well plate ( Corning ) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide . 
Cells were infected with S. Typhimurium strains and cultured in TYE broth as described above , at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 . 
Plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to synchronize infection . 
After 30 min , the supernatant was replaced with complete growth medium containing 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin . 
Cells were lysed with Tri reagent ( Molecular Research Center ) 3 h 30 min later , and total RNA was extracted according to the recommendations of the manufacturer . 
RNA was further puriﬁed by using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit ( Qiagen ) and subjected to DNase treatment with the DNA-free kit ( Life Technologies ) . 
Reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR were performed as outlined above . 
Analysis of FliC protein levels by Western blotting . 
The indicated Salmonella strains were cultured in TYE broth for 3 h , as described above . 
Cell lysates corresponding to about 5 107 CFU were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane ( Millipore ) ( 22 ) . 
FliC and the housekeeping protein GroEL were analyzed by using rabbit Salmonella H antiserum i ( Difco ) , rabbit Salmonella H antiserum d ( Difco ) , and rabbit GroEL antiserum ( Sigma ) , in conjunction with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody ( Bio-Rad Laboratories ) . 
Chemiluminescence was detected by using a ChemiDoc-It system ( UVP ) . 
Images were processed with Photoshop ( Adobe ) to adjust brightness and contrast uniformly to the entire image .

RESULTS
S. Typhimurium as a model to study TviA-mediated ﬂagellin regulation . 
Since S. Typhi is not pathogenic for mice , we wanted to investigate how TviA affects the development of CD4 T cell responses using a mouse-virulent S. Typhimurium strain expressing the S. Typhi tviA gene . 
To this end , we employed a S. Typhi-murium phoN : : tviA mutant in which the tviA promoter as well as the tviA coding sequence are inserted chromosomally into the phoN gene ( 15 ) . 
The tviA gene and remnants of the phoN gene are encoded by opposite strands , ensuring that the transcription of tviA is controlled solely by its native promoter . 
The phoN gene is disrupted in the S. Typhimurium phoN : : tviA mutant , and the contribution of tviA to host-microbe interactions can be ascertained by comparing it with an isogenic S. Typhimurium phoN mutant . 
To compare responses to those generated when phase I ﬂagellin ( FliC ) and phase II ﬂagellin ( FljB ) proteins of S. Typhimurium are completely absent , we used an isogenic nonﬂagellated S. Typhi-murium phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant ( 16 ) . 
To provide a proof of concept for our approach , we compared FliC expression in the above-described S. Typhimurium strains with those in equivalent S. Typhi strains grown under tviA-induc-ing conditions using detection of the heat shock protein GroEL as a loading control . 
Using anti-S . 
Typhi FliC serum ( anti-Hd se-rum ) , low-level FliC expression was detected in S. Typhi strains carrying an intact tviA gene ( wild type and tviB-vexE mutant ) ( Fig. 1A and B ) . 
Consistent with a role for TviA in ﬂagellin repression ( 15 ) , the FliC expression level was markedly increased in a S.

Sizes and locations of deletions present in the S. Typhi tviB-vexE mutant ( SW74 ) and the S. Typhi viaB mutant ( SW347 ) are indicated . 
( B and C ) S. Typhi wild-type ( Ty2 ) , tviB-vexE mutant ( SW74 ) , viaB mutant ( SW347 ) , and viaB ﬂiC mutant ( SW483 ) strains as well as S. Typhimurium wild-type ( IR715 ) , phoN mutant ( SW478 ) , phoN : : tviA mutant ( SW474 ) , and phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant ( SW681 ) strains were cultured in TYE medium for 3 h. Expression of FliC was determined by Western blotting using Hd-speciﬁc antiserum ( Hd ) ( B ) or Hi-speciﬁc antiserum ( Hi ) ( C ) . 
As a loading control , the expression of GroEL was examined ( GroEL ) .

Levels of mRNA were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to levels of 16S rRNA .

Typhi strain lacking the tviA gene ( viaB mutant ) . 
As expected , deletion of ﬂiC , the sole ﬂagellin gene present in this monophasic serovar , abrogated FliC expression in S. Typhi ( viaB ﬂiC mutant ) . 
Similarly , S. Typhimurium strains lacking the tviA gene ( wild type and phoN mutant ) exhibited FliC expression at a higher level than did a strain carrying the tviA gene ( phoN : : tviA mutant ) ( Fig. 1C ) . 
In the nonﬂagellated S. Typhimurium phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant , FliC expression was no longer detectable by using anti-S . 
Typhimurium FliC serum ( anti-Hi serum ) . 
In S. Typhi , TviA acts as an auxiliary protein for RcsB , the response regulator of the Rcs phosphorelay system ( 15 , 18 ) . 
TviA exerts its effect on ﬂagellar gene regulation in conjunction with RcsB by repressing transcription of the ﬂagellar master regulators ﬂhDC , which control the expression of ﬂagellar genes ( 15 , 16 ) . 
Consistent with this idea , the expression of tviA in S. Typhimu-rium resulted in the concomitant downregulation of ﬂiC and ﬂjB mRNA levels ( Fig. 1D and E ) , as determined by quantitative realtime PCR . 
Thus , the TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellin expression observed in S. Typhi could be recapitulated by introducing the tviA regulatory gene into S. Typhimurium . 
TviA-mediated gene regulation reduces antigen presentation in cell culture . 
We initiated our analysis by investigating whether tviA-mediated gene regulation would lower ﬂiC expression levels when bacteria reside within host cells . 
Murine mono-nuclear ( JAWSII ) cells were infected with S. Typhimurium strains carrying the S. Typhi tviA gene ( phoN : : tviA mutant ) or lacking the tviA gene ( phoN mutant ) , and the expression level of ﬂiC in intracellular bacteria was determined 4 h later by quantitative real-time PCR . 
The presence of the tviA gene signiﬁcantly ( P 0.05 ) reduced ﬂiC transcript levels in intracellular bacteria ( Fig. 1F ) . 
As expected , no ﬂiC expression could be detected in JAWSII cells infected with the S. Typhimurium phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant . 
The observation that TviA reduced ﬂiC transcript levels within phagocytes was intriguing , since it raised the possibility that bacterial gene regulation might diminish the amount of antigen available for presentation . 
To test this hypothesis , we isolated CD11c dendritic cells from spleens of mice ( C57BL/6 Nramp / mice ) and treated them with the vehicle control ( DPBS ) or with different MOIs of S. Typhimurium strains carrying the tviA gene ( phoN : : tviA mutant ) , lacking the tviA gene ( phoN mutant ) , or lacking ﬂagellum expression ( phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant ) . 
To assess antigen presentation , CD11c dendritic cells were cocultured for 16 h with CD4 T cells expressing a S. Typhimurium FliC-speciﬁc T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) ( ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells ) ( 27 , 28 ) . 
Finally , the activation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells was assessed by detecting the expression of CD69 , an early marker of T cell activation which is expressed rapidly on the surface of activated T cells after TCR ligation ( 31 ) . 
Prominent CD69 expression on ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells was observed after coculture with dendritic cells infected with the S. Typhimurium phoN mutant at MOIs of 10 and 100 ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In contrast , coculture with dendritic cells infected with the S. Typhimurium phoN : : tviA mutant at an MOI of 10 did not result in CD69 expression on ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells , while CD69 expression was signiﬁcantly ( P 0.05 ) reduced at an MOI of 100 compared to that elicited by the phoN mutant ( Fig. 2B ) . 
No activation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells was observed after coculture with dendritic cells infected with the nonﬂagellated S. Typhimurium phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant , suggesting that the observed CD4 T cell responses were antigen speciﬁc . 
Collectively , these data supported the idea that TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellum expression diminished antigen presentation in vitro . 
TviA diminishes ﬂagellin-speciﬁc , naive CD4 T cell responses in vivo . 
To test the in vivo relevance of our observations , ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells were adoptively transferred into recipient mice ( C57BL/6 Nramp / ) . 
One day later , recipient mice were inoculated intragastrically with sterile medium ( mock infection ) or with the S. Typhimurium phoN mutant , the phoN : : tviA mutant , or the phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant . 
Flagellin-speciﬁc T cell responses to infection with virulent S. Typhimurium remain localized to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( 27 ) . 
We thus measured the expansion of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells 5 days after infection in Peyer 's patches using ﬂow cytometry . 
The CD90 .1 marker was used to distinguish ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells of the donor mouse ( CD90 .1 cells ) from T cells of the recipient mouse ( CD90 .1 cells ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The fraction of CD4 CD90 .1 cells present in the Peyer 's patch lymphocyte population was signiﬁcantly ( P 0.05 ) increased in mice infected with the S. Typhimu-rium phoN mutant compared to mice infected with the phoN : : tviA mutant or the phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant ( Fig. 3B ) . 
These data suggested that TviA-mediated ﬂagellin repression blunted the expansion of naive ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells during S. Typhimurium infection . 
To further examine the effect of TviA on the activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells , ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells were labeled with CFSE and adoptively transferred into recipient mice ( C57BL/6 Nramp / ) . 
Recipient mice were inoculated intragastrically with sterile medium ( mock infection ) or with the S. Typhimurium phoN mutant , the phoN : : tviA mutant , or the phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant . 
The progressive halving of CFSE ﬂuorescence intensity associated with T cell proliferation was monitored 5 days after infection in both Peyer 's patches ( Fig. 4A ) and mesenteric lymph nodes ( Fig. 4B ) . 
Expression of CD11a , an integrin important for the expansion and differentiation of primary T cells ( 32 ) , was monitored to assess T cell activation . 
The presence of the tviA gene signiﬁcantly ( P 0.05 ) blunted the proliferation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc T cells in both Peyer 's patches ( Fig. 4C ) and mesenteric lymph nodes ( Fig. 4D ) during infection with the phoN : : tviA mutant compared to infection with the phoN mutant . 
Proliferation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc T cells was antigen speciﬁc , because it was not observed during infection with a S. Typhimurium strain lacking ﬂagellin antigens ( phoN ﬂiC ﬂjB mutant ) . 
These data suggested that TviA-mediated ﬂagellin regulation suppressed the proliferation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells at mucosal sites during S. Typhimurium infection . 
To investigate how the pathogen is affected by TviA-mediated ﬂagellin regulation , ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells were adoptively transferred into recipient mice ( C57BL/6 Nramp / ) . 
One day later , recipient mice were inoculated intragastrically with sterile medium ( mock infection ) or with the S. Typhimurium phoN mutant or the phoN : : tviA mutant .

Dissemination of S. Typhimurium to the spleen was increased approximately 10-fold ( P 0.05 ) by the presence of the tviA gene ( Fig. 5C ) . 
DISCUSSION
Flagellin is a dominant CD4 T cell antigen during S. Typhimurium infection ( 23 , 24 ) . 
Tracking of the fate of naive ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells during oral S. Typhimurium infection using an adoptive transfer system revealed rapid activation in Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes but no response in the spleen ( 27 ) . 
This activation pattern is unrelated to the bacterial load within these organs , but as our data suggest , it might be inﬂuenced by antigen availability . 
During infection of mice , ﬂiC transcription is detected only in S. Typhimurium bacteria recovered from Peyer 's patches but not in bacteria recovered from the mesenteric lymph node and spleen ( 21 ) . 
Here we show that by lowering FliC expression levels , the introduction of the tviA gene into S. Typhimurium reduced the activation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells in Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes . 
Collectively , these data suggest that antigen availability in Peyer 's patches is critical for the activation of naive ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells in Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes . 
TviA has emerged as a master regulator of processes that enable S. Typhi to cause disseminated illness in humans , rather than remaining localized to the intestine and mesenteric lymph node ( 33 ) . 
Through osmoregulation of TviA expression , S. Typhi can sense its transition from the intestinal lumen into tissue and respond rapidly by repressing ﬂagellum and invasion gene expression while activating the expression of the Vi capsular polysaccharide ( 16 , 20 ) . 
Speciﬁcally , TviA represses the transcription of 105 genes involved in the function of the invasion-associated type III secretion system , in chemotaxis , and in ﬂagellum biosynthesis , including ﬂiC and ﬂjB ( 15 ) . 
Our results suggest that by repressing ﬂagellum gene expression , TviA can suppress ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cell responses that help limit dissemination from the mes-enteric lymph node to the spleen . 
These observations add to a growing body of work suggesting that ﬂagellin expression in the intestinal mucosa is an obstacle for bacterial dissemination to systemic sites . 
The nonﬂagellate organism S. enterica serovar Gallinarum causes a disseminated illness in poultry , termed fowl typhoid . 
Restoration of ﬂagellum expression in S. Gallinarum results in severe attenuation and limits the patho-gen 's ability to disseminate within its avian host ( 34 ) . 
Similarly , ﬂagellin expression limits the dissemination of S. Typhimurium to the spleen in a chick model of infection ( 16 , 35 ) . 
A S. Typhimu-rium variant , termed deﬁnitive phage type 2 ( DT2 ) , which is associated exclusively with disseminated disease in pigeons ( 36 ) , exhibits repressed ﬂagellum expression after growth at 42 °C , the approximate body temperature of its avian host ( 37 ) . 
This observation suggests that disseminated disease caused by DT2 in pigeons is also accompanied by a repression of ﬂagellum expression in host tissue . 
One caveat of comparing data from avian hosts with those from mammalian hosts is the lack of lymph nodes in the former group . 
S. Typhimurium does not spread beyond the mesenteric lymph node in immunocompetent humans , although mice infected with the pathogen develop bacteremia ( 2 ) . 
While barrier functions are impaired in mice compared to humans , the mesenteric lymph node of mice still serves as a protective ﬁlter to restrain the dissemination of bacteria , because its surgical removal increases bacterial loads in the spleen ( 38 , 39 ) . 
Our data suggest that TviA-mediated suppression of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc CD4 T cell responses facilitates passing the barrier formed by the mesenteric lymph node , thereby resulting in increased bacterial dissemination to the spleen . 
In conclusion , TviA-mediated repression of ﬂagellin expression in intestinal tissue is one of the properties that help explain why S. Typhi is more efﬁcient than S. Typhimurium in disseminating beyond the mesenteric lymph node and causes bacteremia . 
FIG 4 Effect of TviA on activation and proliferation of ﬂagellin-speciﬁc , naive SM1 T cells in Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes . 
A total of 1 106 CFSE-labeled , ﬂagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells were adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 Nramp / mice . 
Groups of these mice were mock treated ( transfer only ) or orally infected with the indicated S. Typhimurium strains . 
T cells were isolated from Peyer 's patches ( A and C ) and mesenteric lymph nodes ( B and D ) 5 days after infection . 
CFSE staining as well as CD11a expression on SM1 T cells were examined by ﬂow cytometry ( gated on CD4 CD90 .1 SM1 T cells ) . 
( A and B ) Representative plots for CD11a and CFSE staining ( top ) and representative histogram plots for CFSE staining in SM1 T cells ( bottom ) . 
( C and D ) Bars represent the geometric means standard errors of CD11a-expressing , CFSE-low SM1 T cells in groups of 3 mice .

FIG 5 TviA augments dissemination to the spleen . 
Flagellin-speciﬁc SM1 T cells were adoptively transferred into Nramp / mice . 
Animals were mock treated ( n 3 ) or orally inoculated with the S. Typhimurium phoN mutant ( SW478 ) ( n 5 ) or the phoN : : tviA mutant ( SW474 ) ( n 5 ) . 
The bacterial load in Peyer 's patches ( A ) , mesenteric lymph node ( B ) , or spleen ( C ) was determined 3 days after infection . 
Bars represent the geometric means standard errors .
