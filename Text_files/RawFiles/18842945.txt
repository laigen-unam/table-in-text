The commercial PremiTest Salmonella kit uses a multiplexed DNA typing test aimed at identifying common serovars of Salmonella enterica . 
It was used in assays over a 9-month period in the Belgian reference laboratory that performs the routine identiﬁcation of Salmonella strains of animal origin . 
A blind analysis of 754 strains was conducted in parallel by classical serotyping and the PremiTest assay . 
Full results were available for 685 strains ( 90.8 % ) by serotyping , while the remaining 69 strains were found to be nontypeable due to either a lack of surface antigen expression or autoagglutination properties . 
When the PremiTest assay ( version 4.2 ) was performed with crude bacterial extracts , it identiﬁed 658 strains ( 87.3 % ) , including most strains found to be nontypeable by serotyping . 
In contrast , it gave no , wrong , dual , or noninterpretable results for 96 strains , for which 23 were caused by assay failures . 
When puriﬁed DNA instead of crude extracts were tested , the number of strains successfully identiﬁed to the serovar level increased to 714 ( 94.7 % ) , while all assay failures were cleared . 
Our conclusion is that , in its actual development stage , the application of the investigated kit to puriﬁed DNA samples offers a valuable alternative to classical serotyping for laboratories performing the routine identiﬁcation of Salmonella strains belonging to commonly encountered serovars and isolated from a given geographical area , assuming that the system has been validated beforehand with a signiﬁcant number of strains originating from that particular area . 
The scoring of antigenic formulae for Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica strain typing uses the Kaufmann-White scheme , which is based on the reactivities of speciﬁc antisera with the Salmonella surface antigens and which is considered the reference method ( 3 , 16 ) . 
More than 150 different somatic O and ﬂagellar H antigens are used for the characterization of over 2,500 serovars ( 3 , 15 ) . 
To compensate for the methodological constraints associated with antigen proﬁling , alternative strat-egies aimed at replacing or complementing the reference method have been proposed over the last decade . 
These include PCR and real-time PCR speciﬁc identiﬁcation and typing methods ( 6 , 8 , 9 , 14 , 20 , 22 , 23 ) , multiplex PCR ( 1 , 10 ) , DNA sequencing ( 13 ) , and DNA microarray analysis ( 5 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 27 ) . 
Antibody-based arrays have been developed as well ( 4 , 7 , 21 , 26 ) . 
The PremiTest Salmonella assay ( PT ; DSM Nutritional Products ) was previously evaluated in our laboratory ( 25 ) . 
It uses a DNA-based methodology called the multiplex ligation detection reaction ( LDR ) to generate a collection of ligated probes from the template genome that are further ampliﬁed by PCR with a single pair of amplimers ( 19 , 24 , 25 ) . 
The ampliﬁed molecules are subsequently hybridized to a low-density DNA microarray spotted with probe-speciﬁc complementary oligonucleotides .

rated into one of the PCR primers , generating biotinylated ampliﬁcation products that are detected on the microarray by colorimetric detection . 
Array images are analyzed with a photometric detector and are computed online through the use of customized software . 
The target genetic markers were selected to give , as far as possible , a unique microarray hybridization proﬁle ( i.e. , a PT signature ) for each S. enterica serovar considered ( 2 ) . 
The system was initially evaluated with strains isolated from Belgium and The Netherlands , and the strains were selected to fairly represent the local diversity of Salmonella serovars associated with foodproducing animals ( 25 ) . 
In the present work , a blind comparison of PT with the classical serotyping method was conducted over a 9-month period ( from April to December 2007 ) with every strain that arrived at the Belgian reference laboratory for routine testing of Salmonella strains of animal origin . 
A total of 754 strains belonging to 58 different sero-vars were tested . 
Each strain was typed in parallel by slide agglutination by the classical serotyping scheme with antisera purchased from the Statens Serum Institute ( Copenha-gen , Denmark ) and Bio-Rad ( La Jolla , CA ) . 
The antisera were used according to the manufacturers ' instructions . 
PT is supplied as a kit containing premixed LDR buffers and probes , customized DNA microarrays in a microtube format ( Array Tubes ; ClonDiag , Jena , Germany ) , and re-agents and buffers for microarray hybridization and staining . 
The assay requires standard laboratory equipment , such as a minicentrifuge , a PCR thermocycler , and a rotating heating block for hybridization and staining of the array tubes ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) . 
The array images are generated with a dedicated microarray reader ( Array Tube reader ; ClonDiag ) connected to a standard computer running software customized for PT data analysis ( version 4.2 ) . 
The cost of the assay ( without DNA extraction and any other laboratory cost allowance ) was $ 31.5 per sample at the time of testing . 
The analysis time was about 1.5 working days for a 36-sample batch . 
According to the instructions of the manufacturer ( CheckPoints , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) , the assays were conducted with crude DNA preparations obtained by boiling a small amount of colony material . 
In our hands , however , such crude extracts yielded correct results for only 87.3 % of the samples tested . 
Testing of the remaining 12.7 % of the samples led to assay failures or to wrong , partial , or noninterpretable results . 
An increase or decrease in the amount of sample and the use of a lysis buffer prior to boiling of the sample improved the results in some instances but did not do so systematically . 
Using the commercial kit DNeasy blood and tissue kit ( Qiagen Inc. , Valencia , CA ) , we therefore extracted the total genomic DNA from those strains with assay failures or suspect results . 
By the use of puriﬁed DNA , PTs were 100 % successful and allowed the results to be updated to 714 strains ( 94.7 % ) with correct identiﬁcations , 16 strains ( 2.1 % ) with a PT signature corresponding to two possible serovars , 19 strains ( 2.5 % ) with unknown PT signatures ( i.e. , the strains were not recognized as deﬁned serovars ) , and 5 strains ( 0.6 % ) with incorrect identiﬁcations . 
The serovars determined by classical slide agglutination and PT were found to be signiﬁcantly associated , as indicated by independency 2 statistical assessment ( P 0.01 ) . 
The probabilities of obtaining a successful result by PT performed with crude bacterial extracts and DNA were 0.894 and 0.968 , respectively . 
The results are summarized in Table 1 . 
See Table S1 in the supplemental material for detailed strain typing data . 
Salmonella strains leading to recurrent assay failures with crude material often belonged to serovar Typhimurium , Infantis , or Paratyphi B var . 
Java ( Fig. 1A to F ) . 
Such crude strain extracts are thought to contain an unidentiﬁed bacterial compound that interferes with the assay procedure . 
The relatively high incidence of these serovars during the assessment period probably accounts for the observed frequency of assay failures . 
PT results yielding a PT signature but no serovar name typically belonged to uncommon serovars , as estimated by classical serotyping , suggesting that their associated PT signature either was never encountered during system validation or was rarely so ( Fig. 1L ) . 
We also noticed that more than two-thirds of the strains ( 37/50 ) yielding unknown PT signatures when crude extracts were tested were , in fact , assigned a wrong PT signature by the software . 
When puri-ﬁed DNA from these strains was tested , these strains displayed a different PT signature , suggesting that the software had misinterpreted the corresponding poor-quality proﬁles obtained with the crude extracts ( Fig. 1E ) . 
Incorrect serovar identiﬁcations issued from strains that up to now displayed PT signatures found to be exclusively associated with another serovar . 
Therefore , the interpretation of some PT signatures as deﬁned in version 4.2 of the software should be revised ( Fig. 1H ) . 
Dual results occurred for strains with PT signatures associated with two serovars ( Fig. 1I and J ) . 
In summary , we found that PT performs signiﬁcantly better when puriﬁed DNA rather than crude extracts are used . 
The proportion of Salmonella strains successfully identiﬁed to the serovar level was 4 % greater than that successfully identiﬁed by the classical serotyping method . 
This value can be increased by another 2 % if strains assigned two possible serovars are considered , which leads to a maximum success rate of 96.8 % . 
Our assessment of the method also pointed to some incomplete or questionable PT signatures , and these should be regularly updated on the basis of present and future results . 
The current version of PT makes use of a microarray proﬁle made up of 13 DNA markers for serovar discrimination . 
Given the relatively low level of complexity of the microarray proﬁles generated , on the one hand , and the limited number of serovars recognized by the system , on the other , it is expected that additional DNA markers will be required to identify unequivocally any of the 2,500 Salmo-nella serovars deﬁned to date . 
Therefore , future versions of the system should be extended to generate PT signatures that do not overlap different serovars . 
In our opinion , the present version of PT already offers a valuable alternative to the classical serotyping method for the routine identiﬁcation of common Salmonella serovars . 
Future versions that increase the robustness of the test and the number of DN markers for serovar discrimination will further enhance the value of the system .
