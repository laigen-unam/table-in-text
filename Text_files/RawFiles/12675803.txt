Summary
In enterobacteria such as Salmonella , ﬂagellar biogenesis is dependent upon the master operon ﬂhDC at the apex of the ﬂagellar gene hierarchy , which is divided into three classes 1 , 2 and 3 . 
Previously we reported that depletion of the ClpXP ATP-dependent protease results in dramatic enhancement of class 2 and class 3 gene transcription , whereas the transcription level of the ﬂhDC operon remains normal in Sal-monella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
This suggests that the ClpXP protease may be responsible for the turnover of the FlhD and FlhC master regulators ( Tomoyasu , T. , Ohkishi , T. , Ukyo , Y. , Tokumitsu , A. , Takaya , A. , Suzuki , M. et al. , 2002 , J Bacteriol 184:645 -- 653 ) . 
In this study , to establish the role of the ClpXP protease in the turnover of FlhD and FlhC proteins , we analysed levels of the FlhD and FlhC proteins in wild-type and ClpXP mutant cells using anti-FlhD and anti-FlhC antibodies . 
The results show that both FlhD and FlhC proteins are markedly accumulated in ClpXP mutant cells and the half-life of FlhC is approximately ﬁvefold longer in the ClpXP mutant , suggesting that the ClpXP protease is responsible for the degradation of FlhD and FlhC . 
The results also show that the ClpXP protease degrades both proteins in FlhD2FlhC2 complex but does not seem to recognize the respective subunits synthesized individually.Taken together , it is suggested that the cellular concentration of the FlhD2FlhC2 master regulator is tightly controlled at the post-translational level by the ClpXP protease . 
We also examined the role of other members of the ATP ¬

dependent protease family in the regulation of ﬂagellar biogenesis and concluded that only ClpXP in this family functions as a negative regulator for ﬂagellar biogenesis in Salmonella . 
Introduction
Proteolysis functions as a precise regulatory mechanism which limits availability of key metabolic enzymes or regulatory proteins and rids the cell of terminally damaged polypeptides . 
Most intracellular proteolysis in bacteria is initiated by ATP-dependent proteases , including Clp and Lon ( for reviews , see Goldberg , 1992 ; Gottesman , 1996 ; Maurizi , 1992 ) . 
Two types of Clp protease exist in Gramnegative bacteria , the ﬁrst with ClpP subunit as the proteolytic core , and the second with HslV ( or ClpQ ) ( Porank-iewicz et al. , 1999 ) . 
ClpP is classiﬁed as a serine protease and HslV has a threonine active site . 
The Clp proteins are assembled into structures similar to the eukaryotic proteasome ( Kessel et al. , 1995 ; Rohrwild et al. , 1996 ) . 
The ClpP proteolytic subunit associates with either of two ATPases , ClpA or ClpX , whereas the HslV proteolytic subunit associates with the HslU ( or ClpY ) ATPase . 
Furthermore , ClpA , ClpX , and HslU function as molecular chaperones which catalyse ATP-dependent protein unfolding . 
This suggests that the function of Clp chaperones is to bind and unfold misfolded proteins that can then be transferred to a proteolytic component ( Wickner et al. , 1999 ) . 
ClpX , ClpA , HslU and Lon are also known as members of the AAA + ( ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities ) superfamily ( Neuwald et al. , 1999 ) . 
We have recently reported that the ClpXP protease functions as a negative regulator for ﬂagellum biogenesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Tomoyasu et al. , 2002 ) . 
The ﬂagellum is an organelle consisting of three distinctive structural parts , the basal body consisting of a central rod and several rings , the short carved structure called the hook , and the long helical ﬁlament ( for a review , see Macnab , 1996 ) . 
More than 50 genes are known to be involved in ﬂagellar formation and function in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
The transcription of these genes forms a highly ordered cascade called the ﬂagellar regulon and is co-ordered with the ﬂagellar assembly hierarchy ( Kutsukake and Iino , 1994 ; Kutsukake et al. , 1990 ) . 
The

444 T. Tomoyasu , A. Takaya , E. Isogai and T. Yamamoto operon the furthest downstream in the cascade is the class 3 operon which contains genes involved in ﬁlament formation , ﬂagellar rotation and chemotaxis . 
Expression of the class 3 operon requires an alternative sigma factor , s28 , encoded by ﬂiA which belongs to a class 2 operon encoding components involved in formation of the hookbasal complex ( Ohnishi et al. , 1990 ; Liu and Matsumura , 1994 ) . 
At the apex of the ﬂagellar gene hierarchy is the class 1 ﬂhDC operon ( Kutsukake et al. , 1980 ) . 
Because the ﬂhDC operon is essential for transcription of all the genes in the ﬂagellar cascade , it is also called the master operon . 
The two operon products , FlhD and FlhC , together activate the s70 promoter of the class 2 genes by interacting with the RNA polymerase a subunit ( Ikebe et al. , 1999 ) . 
Transcription of the ﬂhDC operon is known to be regulated by signals from a network of cell components including CRP , OmpR , H-NS and the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system ( Yokota and Gots , 1970 ; Shi et al. , 1992 ; Bertin et al. , 1994 ; Kutsukake , 1997 ) . 
In a previous study , we demonstrated that depletion of ClpXP results in dramatic enhancement of the transcription of class 2 and class 3 genes , leaving the transcription level of the ﬂhDC operon almost normal . 
The enhancement disappears in the DﬂhDC background , suggesting that the FlhD and FlhC master regulators are possible targets of the ClpXP protease ( Tomoyasu et al. , 2002 ) . 
In the present study , we demonstrate that the FlhD and FlhC proteins accumulate in ClpXP-depleted cells using antibodies against FlhD and FlhC . 
We propose that the ClpXP protease negatively regulates transcription of the ﬂagellar regulon by controlling the turnover of the FlhD2FlhC2 master regulators . 
Results
Effect of mutations in ATP-dependent protease-related genes on expression from the ﬂagellum gene ﬂiC promoter in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
Most intracellular proteolysis in bacteria is elicited by members of the ATP-dependent protease family , including ClpXP , ClpAP , HslVU and Lon . 
To determine the contribution of various ATP-dependent proteases on Salmonella ﬂagellar biogenesis , we examined the effect of individual mutations in genes encoding the proteases ClpXP , ClpAP , HslVU and Lon on the transcription of ﬂiC which encodes the ﬁlament . 
The clpA : : Km and hslV : : Km mutants were constructed from strain c3306 in the present study ( see Experimental procedures ) . 
The lon : : Cm , clpX : : Cm . 
clpP : : Km , and clpP : : Cm mutants which were previously constructed ( Yamamoto et al. , 2001 ; Takaya et al. , 2002 ) were also subjected to this study . 
Because the clpP gene exists in an operon with clpX , the clpP : : Cm mutation results in a polar mutation in the clpX gene . 
However , the clpP : : Km mutation does not affect the expression of the clpX gene because the Km resistance cassette used here allows natural downstream transcription ( Yamamoto et al. , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is known to express the different H antigens , H : i ( phase 1 ) and H :1,2 ( phase 2 ) , which are encoded by the ﬂiC and ﬂjB genes respectively . 
The alternative expression of the two genes results in the oscillation of phenotype known as phase variation , which occurs with frequencies from 10-3 to 10-5 per bacterium per generation ( Macnab , 1996 ) . 
The ﬂiC gene is subjected to repression by the product of the ﬂjA gene which is contained in the ﬂjB operon . 
To avoid the effect of ﬂjA , we used derivatives carrying an ﬂjB : : Tn10 mutation in the background for the present transcription assay . 
The chromosomal ﬂiC-lac fusion was introduced by transduction and the resulting transductants were assayed for b-galactosidase activity . 
The results are shown in Fig. 1 . 
Whereas the mutations clpP : : Km , clpX : : Cm and clpP : : Cm resulted in overexpression of bgalactosidase from the ﬂiC promoter , mutation in the clpA gene did not lead to signiﬁcant change in the bgalactosidase level , suggesting that the ClpAP protease is not involved in the expression of ﬂagellar regulon . 
The lon : : Cm mutation resulted in approximately twofold increase in expression from the ﬂiC promoter . 
On the otherhand , the depletion of HslVU protease by hslV : : Km mutation resulted in a slight decrease in the ﬂiC transcription . 
These results suggest that among the members of the cytoplasmic ATP-dependent protease family the ClpXP protease mainly functions as a negative regulator for the expression of the Salmonella ﬂagellar regulon .

Immunoblotting for detection of FlhC protein in various pro-tease-depleted mutants . 
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from strains of CS2033 ( lane 1 ) , CS2034 ( lane 2 ) , CS2035 ( lane 3 ) , CS2036 ( lane 4 ) , CS2457 ( lane 5 ) , CS2162 ( lane 6 ) , and CS2193 ( lane 7 ) , and then separated in a 15 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel . 
Bacterial cells of strain CS2628 was grown to OD600 of 1.0 in L-broth at 37 ∞ C. Cells were collected , lysed and run in lane 8 . 
The separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF-membrane and then immun-ostained with antibody against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium c3306 FlhC protein ( C ) . 
The separated proteins were also immun-ostained with anti-FliC antibody ( B ) . 
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE patterns of the same samples used for immunoblotting analysis are shown in ( A ) . 
Lane M contains the following molecular mass standards ( BIO RAD prestained SDS-PAGE standards broad range ) from top to bottom : 210 , 125 , 101 , 56.2 and 35.8 kDa . 
The molecular sizes of the FliC ( B ) and FlhC ( C ) are 51.6 kDa and 21.6 kDa respectively . 
The speciﬁc effect of the ClpXP protease on the accumulation of FliC protein was also conﬁrmed by immunob-lotting analysis of the cell lysates prepared from isogenic parent and various protease mutant strains with anti-FliC antibody ( Fig. 2A ) . 
All strains used in this analysis have the ﬂjB : : Tn10 mutation in their backgrounds , resulting the expression of ﬂiC gene ( phase 1 ) . 
We have previously reported that the depletion of the ClpXP protease results in signiﬁcant accumulation of FliA , a ﬂagellin-speciﬁc sigma factor , HAP1 and HAP3 , which are hook-ﬁlament junction proteins , and HAP2 , a ﬁlament cap protein , besides accumulating of FliC protein ( Tomoyasu et al. , 2002 ) . 
Taken together , it is suggested that among the members of the ATP-dependent protease family the ClpXP protease mainly regulates the ﬂagellar biogenesis in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Levels of master regulators, FlhD and FlhC, in the ClpXP protease-depleted mutant
Our previous study showed that the level of bgalactosidase activity in cells carrying the ﬂhD-lac fusion 
Turnover of FlhDC by ClpXP protease 445 was not changed , in contrast to the marked increase of bgalactosidase levels expressed from the ﬂiC-lac fusion , by mutations in either clpX or clpP ( Tomoyasu et al. , 2002 ) . 
This suggested that ClpXP is responsible for the modulation of the FlhD and FlhC master regulators at the posttranscriptional and/or post-translational levels ( Tomoyasu et al. , 2002 ) . 
To examine the possibility whether FlhD and FlhC are targets for negative regulation by the ClpXP protease , we decided to measure the levels of the FlhD and FlhC proteins in wild-type cells and various protease mutants by immunoblotting analysis . 
To do this , we ﬁrst constructed plasmids encoding the N-terminally His-tagged FlhD or FlhC , puriﬁed the His-tagged proteins , and used these to immunize rabbits as described in the Experimental procedures . 
Figure 2C shows the results of an immunoblotting analysis of whole cell lysates with antiFlhC antibody . 
To indicate the FlhC protein on the immu-noblot , the cell lysate of ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutant in which the FlhC protein was overexpressed from the recombinant plasmid pTKY595 was immunstained with anti-FlhC antibody ( Fig. 2C lane 8 ) . 
In wild-type cells , a slight amount of FlhC protein was detected by the anti-FlhC antibody . 
As far as we know , no studies detecting FlhC or FlhD in Salmonella or E. coli cells with antibodies have been reported , suggesting that both regulator proteins are short-lived and/or exist in low amounts . 
However , in DClpXP , DClpP and DClpX cell lysates , a large amount of FlhC protein was detected . 
These results indicate that FlhC accumulates upon depletion of the ClpXP protease . 
Detection of the FlhD protein was not successful even in ClpXP-depleted cells using the anti-FlhD antibody established in the present study . 
Thus , we constructed a plasmid , pTKY594 , capable of overexpressing the ﬂhDC operon under the regulation of the PA1lac0-1 promoter system described in Experimental procedures . 
Bacterial cells were transformed by this plasmid and subjected to immu-noblotting analysis to detect the FlhD and FlhC proteins . 
The results are shown in Fig. 3 . 
In the DClpXP cells , FlhC was detected even in the absence of IPTG , a condition in which read-through expression of the ﬂhC gene from the PA1lac0-1 promoter produces FlhC in higher amounts than in cells carrying the corresponding gene on the chromosome ( Fig. 3B ) . 
To indicate a band corresponding to the FlhD protein , the lysate of the ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutant cells overexpressing the FlhD protein in the presence of IPTG from the recombinant plasmid was immunostained with anti-FlhD antibody ( Fig. 3C , lane 8 ) . 
The lower band with higher intensity is a non-speciﬁc because it is also detected in the cell lysate of a ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutant ( Fig. 4B , lane 7 ) . 
Overproduction as a result of the read-through expression of the ﬂhD gene on the plasmid in the absence IPTG enabled detection of the FlhD protein in the DClpXP mutants ( Fig. 3C , lane 4 ) . 
This shows that the FlhD protein also accumulates in ClpXP-depleted cells , suggesting that 
446 T. Tomoyasu , A. Takaya , E. Isogai and T. Yamamoto the ClpXP protease is responsible for the turnover of the FlhD/FlhC master regulators .

Whole cell extracts were prepared from strains CS2033 ( lane 1 ) , CS2034 ( lane 2 ) , CS2477 ( lane 3 ) , and CS2478 ( lane 4 ) and electrophoresed in a 15 % SDS-poly-acrylamide gel . 
Bacterial culture of strain CS2637 grown overnight was diluted 1:100 into fresh L-broth and followed by the induction of FlhD and FlhC expression by the addition of 20 mM IPTG for 2 h. Cells were collected , lysed and run in lane 5 . 
The separated proteins were transferred to a membrane and then immunostained with anti-FlhC antibody ( B ) and anti-FlhD antibody ( C ) . 
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE patterns of the same samples used for immunoblotting analysis are shown in A. Lane M contains the molecular mass standards whose sizes are indicated in the legend to Fig. 2 . 
The molecular sizes of the FlhC ( B ) and FlhD ( C ) are 21.6 kDa and 13.3 kDa respectively . 
Cellular levels of FlhD and FlhC subunits expressed individually
As FlhD and FlhC are known to act together in an FlhD FlhC complex as a master regulator for the ﬂagellar 2 2 regulon ( Claret and Hughes , 2000a ; Liu and Matsumura , 1994 ) , we then examined whether the ClpXP protease recognizes FlhD and FlhC when not in the FlhD FlhC 2 2 complex . 
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from the ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutants carrying recombinant plasmids that express FlhD and FlhC together or individually and subjected to immunoblotting analysis . 
The results are shown in Fig. 4 . 
When FlhD and FlhC proteins were synthesized together , accumulation of both proteins by the depletion of ClpXP protease was conﬁrmed ( lane 2 in Fig 4B or 4C ) . 
Whereas the FlhD protein in amounts sufﬁcient to detect was not in wild-type cells synthesizing FlhD and FlhC together ( lane 1 in Fig 4B ) , it was detectable in cells producing FlhD alone ( lane 3 in Fig 4B ) , suggesting that FlhD is not recognized by the ClpXP protease when not in the FlhD2FlhC2 complex . 
Similarly , the FlhC protein could be easily detected in wild-type cells expressing FlhC alone ( lane 5 in Fig 4C ) , indicating that FlhC also resists ClpXP proteolysis when not in the FlhD2FlhC2 complex . 
These results suggest that the ClpXP protease degrades the FlhD and FlhC in FlhD2FlhC2 complex but does not seem to degrade the respective subunits synthesized individually . 
In vivo stability of FlhC protein in wild-type and ClpXP protease-depleted cell
To test whether the ClpXP protease is involved in the turnover of the master regulators , we determined the in vivo half-life of the FlhC subunit in FlhD2FlhC2 complex by pulse-chase labelling followed by immunoprecipitation of FlhC ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The experiment was performed with cells carrying plasmid pTKY594 . 
In this system , FlhC protein in amounts sufﬁcient enough to precipitate as an immunocomplex was produced by read-through from the PA1lac0-1 promoter even in the absence of IPTG . 
This allowed us to perform half-life determinations of the FlhC protein under almost physiological conditions . 
Whereas the half life of FlhC protein in wild-type cells is 5.6 min , that in DClpXP cells is 30.1 min , indicating stabilization of the FlhC protein by depletion of the ClpXP protease . 
We intended to determine the in vivo half-life of the FlhD subunit in FlhD2FlhC2 complex by pulse-chase labelling followed by immunoprecipitation of the FlhD . 
As indicated in Figs 3C and 4B , the immunoblotting analysis using the anti-FlhD antibody detected a non-speciﬁc band with strong intensity . 
This interfered a quantitative analysis of the radioactivity incorporated into FlhD protein separated on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine a half-life of FlhD in FlhD2FlhC2 complex .

The separated proteins were transferred to a membrane and then immunostained with anti-FlhD and anti-FlhC antibodies ( B and C ) .

Discussion
Production of antibodies speciﬁc to the FlhC and FlhD proteins , master regulators of the Salmonella ﬂagellar regulon , allowed us to establish the role of the ClpXP protease in the expression of these proteins . 
We show here that the FlhC and FlhD proteins accumulate signiﬁcantly in the ClpXP-depleted cells , suggesting that the master transcriptional regulator is degraded by the ClpXP protease . 
It is known that FlhD and FlhC act together in an 
FlhD2C2 heterotetramer to activate transcription of the ﬂagellar regulon ( Liu and Matsumura , 1994 ; Clart and Hughes , 2000a ) . 
Both FlhD and FlhC subunits also homodimerize in vivo and in vitro , suggesting that self interactions stabilize the FlhD2C2 complex ( Clart and Hughes , 2000a ) . 
The present results indicate that neither FlhD or FlhC seems to be recognized by the ClpXP protease when not in the FlhD2FlhC2 complex but both proteins are targeted by the ClpXP-mediated proteolysis when together they preferentially interact to built the heterotetramer . 
The substrate speciﬁcity of ClpXP-mediated proteolysis is determined by the ClpX component . 
The ClpP component consists of two , stacked heptameric rings which enclose a central chamber containing proteolytic active sites ( Wang et al. , 1997 ) . 
Because access to this proteolytic chamber requires passage through small axial pores , ClpX component denatures substrates and delivers them to the chamber for degradation ( Lupas et al. , 1997 , Zwickl et al. , 2000 ) . 
How might ClpX recognize the heterotetramer , FlhD2FlhC2 and not the respective homodimer , FlhD2 and FlhC2 ? 
One possibility is that each subunit of the heterotetramer provides a portion of the degradation signal recognized by ClpX . 
For example , neither region alone is capable of directing ClpX recognition , but together they create a protein environment conductive for ClpX recognition . 
Alternatively , it is possible that the building of the heterotetramer promotes a conformational change that exposes a degradation signal normally masked in each homodimer . 
Recent reports 
448 T. Tomoyasu , A. Takaya , E. Isogai and T. Yamamoto provided the evidence for destabilizing an otherwise stable protein through a protein -- protein interaction that provides the ClpXP-recognition ( Gonzalez et al. , 2000 ) . 
That is to say , UmuD cents and its pro-protein UmuD by themselves exist in vivo as homodimers , when together they preferentially interact to form heterodimer . 
The UmuD cents becomes a substrate of the ClpXP protease when in a heterodimer , while leaving the UmuD protein intact . 
In ClpXP recognition , the involvement of regions near the N - or C-terminus has been reported . 
ClpX recognizes , for example , the co-translationally added 11 amino acid peptide ( AANDENYALAA ) to the C-terminus of the respective truncated protein when ribosomes are stalled in a position without a termination codon ( Keiler et al. , 1996 ; Ibba and Soll , 1999 ) . 
This tagging system is encoded by E. coli ssrA . 
It has been also reported that the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the MuA transposase , QNRRKKAI , is a potential binding site for the ClpX function ( Levchenko et al. , 1995 ) . 
However , the QNRRKKAI synthetic peptide , added in a 1000-fold molar excess to the lO protein , which is an another substrate for the ClpX , did not inhibit the ClpXP-dependent degradation ( Wojtkowiak et al. , 1993 ) . 
In addition , P1 Phd , Mu Rep vir and E. coli ss factor have been reported as ClpXP substrates ( Lehnherr and Yarmolinsky , 1995 : Laachouch et al. , 1996 ; Schweder et al. , 1996 ) . 
As no substantial homology among the C-terminal sequences of these substrates is observed ( Wawrzynow et al. , 1996 ) , it suggests that other factors are involved in ClpX recognition . 
The C-terminal sequences of FlhC and FlhD also show no substantial homology to each other . 
Another well-characterized degradation signal is a component of the bacterial N-end rule degradation pathway ( Tobias et al. , 1991 ) . 
In the degradation of UmuD/D cents described above , a 24 amino acid peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of UmuD , not UmuD cents , was identiﬁed as a region essential for ClpXP-mediated degradation of UmuD cents in a heterodimer complex ( Gonzalez et al. , 2000 ) . 
Studies in vivo on the ss factor suggested that residues 173 -- 188 of the amino acid sequence may directly or indirectly serve as a recognition target for the ClpXP protease ( Schweder et al. , 1996 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
In the present study , we show that the half-life of FlhC in FlhD2FlhC2 complex in wild-type cells ( 5.6 min ) is mark-edly increased to 30.1 min by depletion of ClpXP , suggesting that the lability of FlhC is controlled at the posttranslational level by ClpXP proteolysis . 
The present immunoblotting analyses show that no FlhC or FlhD could be detected in wild-type cells , suggesting that both regulator proteins are short-lived and/or in slight amounts . 
The half-life of FlhC as 5.6 min is almost 1/4 of the cell doubling time . 
The only other study with anti-FlhD and antiFlhC antibodies had been done in Proteus mirabilis in which FlhD and FlhC regulators were detectable with antibodies only during bacterial differentiation into elongated hyperﬂagellated swarm cells ( Claret and Hughes , 2000b ) . 
They established that whereas FlhD and FlhC had half-lives of ~ 6 min and 5 min , respectively , in the early stage of differentiation , the half-lives of both proteins decreased to ~ 2 min after differentiation . 
Our results suggest that FlhC and FlhD belong to the small group of central regulators of cell physiology known as timing proteins ( Gottesman and Maurizi , 1992 ) . 
It is known that the expression of the ﬂhDC operon is regulated by a variety of genes which are unrelated to the ﬂagellar regulon . 
The global regulators , cAMP-CRP complex and H-NS positively regulate the transcription of the ﬂhDC operon ( Yokota and Gots , 1970 ; Kutsukake , 1997 ) . 
The molecular chaperone machine composing DnaK , DnaJ and GrpE , was also shown to be required for transcription of the master operon ( Shi et al. , 1992 ) . 
A two-component regulatory system consisting of OmpR and EnvZ has been shown to be a negative regulator for the transcription of the ﬂhDC operon . 
In contrast to these transcriptional regulators , few post-translational regulators for FlhD and FlhC have been reported . 
The P. mirabilis FlhD and FlhC proteins have been shown to be stabilized in E. coli Lon mutants , indicating the putative involvement of the Lon protease in the turnover of both proteins ( Clart and Hughes , 2000b ) . 
Our results , shown in Figs 1 and 2 , demonstrate that the Lon protease is not predominantly responsible for the transcription of the ﬂagellar regulon or biogenesis in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
In Caulo-bacter , ClpXP , an essential protease in this organism , has been shown to be required for turnover of the transcriptional regulator , CtrA , which controls the expression of cell-cycle-regulated genes encoding ﬂagellar proteins , a DNA methyltransferase and a cell division protein ( Jenal and Fuchs , 1998 ) . 
Our present results suggest that the FlhC and FlhD when are in FlhD2FlhC2 complex are targeted by the ClpXP protease to negatively regulate the transcription of the ﬂagellar regulon . 
To show the direct interaction between the ClpXP and FlhD2FlhC2 , biochemical analysis with FlhC and FlhD reconstituted in vitro and the puriﬁed ClpXP protease is now in progress .

450 T. Tomoyasu , A. Takaya , E. Isogai and T. Yamamoto media were supplemented with ampicillin ( 25 mg ml-1 ) , kanamycin ( 25 mg ml-1 ) , chloramphenicol ( 20 mg ml-1 ) , and tetracycline ( 20 mg ml-1 ) . 
Construction of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium clpA and hslVU mutants 
To inactivate the clpA gene , we replaced the central part of the gene with a kanamycin-resistance cassette . 
The clpA locus was ampliﬁed from the chromosome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium c3306 by PCR with forward primer ( 5 cents - CCTCACCAACTCTCGACATTAC-3 cents ) and reverse primer ( 5 cents - TTAGTGCGCGGCTTCCGGCTTGT-3 cents ) . 
The PCR product was directly cloned into a pT7Blue-2 vector . 
The resulting plasmid , pTKY514 , was cleaved with EcoRV to eliminate a 348 bp central fragment of clpA and then ligated to the fragment encoding the kanamycin-resistance gene generated from PstI-digested pUC4K and then ﬁlled . 
The resulting plasmid , pTKY589 , was digested with MluI and SalI and the fragment encoding clpA : : Km was ligated to MluI-SalI digested pTKY229 , a transferable suicide vector previously constructed ( Yamamoto et al. , 1996 ) . 
The resultant mutator plasmid , pTKY590 , was introduced into E. coli S17 -- 1lpir . 
The chromosomal clpA gene was replaced by clpA : : Km on pTKY590 by conjugative crosses as previously described ( Yamamoto et al. , 1996 ) . 
The mutant was selected by resistance to kanamycin and nalidixic acid . 
A double crossover event resulting in the clpA : : Km mutant was assessed by its sensitivity to ampicillin . 
Disruption of the clpA gene was checked by immunoblotting with anti-E . 
coli ClpA serum ( result not shown ) . 
To inactivate the hslVU operon , the hslV locus was ﬁrst ampliﬁed from the chromosome of serovar Typhimurium c3306 by PCR with forward primer ( 5 cents - TGTGCTTATCCAGT TCGCTG-3 cents ) and reverse primer ( 5 cents - CTCTGTATTCGTAAC CAAGG-3 cents ) and then directly cloned into a pT7Blue-2 vector . 
The resulting plasmid , pTKY511 , was digested with EcoT22I to eliminate the 31 bp central fragment of hslV and ligated to the fragment encoding the kanamycin-resistance gene which was generated from SalI-digested pUC4K and then ﬁlled . 
The resulting plasmid , pTKY518 , was digested with EcoRI and SalI , ﬁlled , and then the fragment encoding hslV : : Km was ligated to the EcoRI digested and ﬁlled pTKY229 . 
The result-ant mutator plasmid , pTKY519 , was introduced into E. coli S17 -- 1lpir . 
The chromosomal hslV gene was replaced by the hslV : : Km on pTKY519 using the same procedure as that to construct the clpA : : Km mutant . 
Disruption of the hslV gene by a double crossover event was conﬁrmed by restriction analysis of the PCR-ampliﬁed fragment from the chromosome of the kanamycin and nalidixic acid-resistant colony ( results not shown ) . 
Construction of plasmids
To construct plasmid pTKY533 encoding N-terminally His-tagged ﬂhC , the locus of ﬂhC was ampliﬁed from the chromosome of strain c3306 using the primer CF ( 5 cents - GGGCG GATCCATGAGTGAAAAAAGCATTGTTCAGG-3 cents ) and the primer CR ( 5 cents - CACCGCTGCAGTTAAACAGCCTGTTC GATCTG-3 cents ) . 
The generated 578 bp fragment was cleaved with BamHI at the 5 cents end and HindIII at the 3 cents end and then cloned into the vector pUHE212-1 . 
Plasmid pTKY534 encoding N-terminally His-tagged ﬂhD was constructed by cloning a PCR-generated BamHI-PstI fragment carrying the ﬂhD gene into the vector pUHE212-1 . 
The primer sequences used for PCR-ampliﬁcation of the ﬂhD gene are as follows : primer DF ( 5 cents - GGTTAGGATCCATGGGAACAATGCATATCCG-3 cents ) and primer DR ( 5 cents - CACTAAGCTTCATGCCCTTTTCT TACGCGCGCCG-3 cents ) . 
Plasmid pTKY594 , in which the expression of ﬂhDC is controlled by the PA1lacO-1 promoter-operator system , was constructed by amplifying a BamHI-PstI fragment carrying the ﬂhDC operon by PCR with primers CF and DR and cloning the fragment into the pUHE21 -- 2Dfd12 which allows the translation of cloned genes start at their authentic start codon . 
Plasmid pTKY595 was constructed by subcloning the BamHI-HindIII fragment carrying the ﬂhC gene of plasmid pTKY533 into the pUHE21 -- 2Dfd12 . 
Plasmid pTKY596 was also constructed by subcloning the BamHI-PstI fragment carrying the ﬂhD gene of plasmid pTKY534 into the pUHE21 -- 2Dfd12 . 
Puriﬁcation of N-terminally His-tagged proteins and generation of anti-FlhC and anti-FlhD antibodies
For puriﬁcation of N-terminally His-tagged FlhC and FlhD , 3 l cultures of E. coli DH5aZ1 derivatives harbouring either pTKY533 or pTKY534 were incubated at 37 ∞ C until the cell density reached an OD600 of 1.0 . 
Then , IPTG was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM for 3 h followed by collection of the cells by centrifugation . 
Wet cell pastes were resuspended in cold lysis buffer ( 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfuluoride , 0.05 % Na-DOC , 0.1 M NaCl ) and sonicated . 
For puriﬁcation of the N-terminally His-tagged FlhC protein which had formed inclusion bodies , 6 M guanidine-HCl was added to the lysis buffer . 
After further centrifugation , the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2 + - NTA Superﬂow column ( 10 ml , HR16/5 Amersham-Pharmacia ) prepared according to the manufacture 's instruction . 
After washing with buffer ( 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2 , 0.1 M NaCl , 8 M urea , 20 mM imidazole ) , the protein was eluted with 100 ml of a 0 -- 500 mM imidazole linear gradient . 
A 1.5 ml portion of the peak fraction was electrophoresed in a 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the eluent from the gel corresponding to the FlhC band was used to immunize a rabbit . 
For puriﬁcation of the N-terminally His-tagged FlhD protein , the supernatant after centrifugation of the sonically disrupted cells was loaded onto a Ni2 + - NTA Superﬂow column and then washed with the buffer ( 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2 , 0.3 M NaCl , 20 mM imidazole ) . 
The FlhD fusion protein was eluted with 30 ml of a 20 -- 250 mM imidazole linear gradient . 
It was further puriﬁed by gel chromatography over a SephadexTM 75 column with PBS . 
A portion of the peak fraction was used to immunize a rabbit . 
Pulse labelling and co-immunoprecipitation
Bacterial cells of strains CS2477 and CS2478 were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 0.25 % glucose , 40 mg ml-1 of the 18 amino acids ( except methionine and cysteine ) and 2 mg ml-1 thiamine at 37 ∞ C to the exponential phase . 
Cells were labelled with 3.7 Mbq ml-1of [ 35S ] - Met and Cys ( Protein labelling mix ; > 37 Tbq mmol-1 ; Amersham ) for 1 min and chased with 200 mg ml-1 of unlabelled methionine and cysteine . 
Aliquots of the cells were taken at appropriate intervals and mixed with TCA ( ﬁnal 5 % ) , chilled on ice for 15 min , and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 2 min . 
The pellets were washed with acetone and resuspended in 30 ml of SDS-buffer ( 10 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 ) . 
One ml of RIPA buffer [ 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 % Na-DOC , 0.1 % SDS , 0.15 M NaCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) ] was added to each resuspended pellet and then centrifuged . 
The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FlhC serum by incubation over-night on ice . 
To collect the immunocomplexes , protein A-sephalose beads ( Amersham-Pharmacia ) were added and incubated for 1 h on ice . 
After centrifugation , the pellets were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and ﬁnally dissolved in 40 ml of SDS-sample buffer ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . 
A portion of each sample was analysed by 15 % SDS-PAGE . 
The radioactivity incorporated into FlhC was quantiﬁed using a BAS2000A photoimager ( Fuji Film ) 
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
Gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli ( 1970 ) using 15 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue . 
For immunoblot analysis , resolved proteins on the gel were transferred onto PVDF-membrane ( Millipore ) as previously reported ( Yamamoto et al. , 1997 ) . 
The membranes were treated with either rabbit anti-S . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium FliC ( 1:25000 ) , FlhC ( 1:5000 ) or FlhD ( 1:2500 ) antiserum , generated as described above , followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG . 
The enzymatic reactions were performed in the presence of 30 mg ml-1 of nitrobluetetrazolium ( DOJINDO , Kumamoto , Japan ) and 15 mg ml-1 bromochloroindolylphosphate ( aMReSCO , Solon , OH ) .
