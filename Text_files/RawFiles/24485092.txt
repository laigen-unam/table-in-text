Article history : 
The aim of the present study was to test the effect of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 ( E. faecium ) on CD4 + T helper immune cell subpopulations and CD25 + cells in ileal lymphatic tissue after challenge with Salmonella ( S. ) Typhimurium DT 104 . 
German Landrace piglets treated with E. faecium ( n = 16 ) as a feed additive and untreated controls ( n = 16 ) were challenged with S. Typhimurium 10 days after weaning . 
The expression of lineage speciﬁc T helper cell subtype master transcription factors on mRNA level was measured in the whole tissue of the gut associated lymphoid tissues ( ileocecal mesenteric lymph node , ileum with Peyer 's patches and papilla ilealis ) and in magnetically sorted T helper cells from blood and ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes at two and 28 days post infection . 
CD25 protein expression of T helper cells was studied by ﬂow cytometry in ileal Peyer 's patches , lymph nodes and blood . 
Distribution and morphology of CD25 + cells was demonstrated in situ by immunohistochemistry in parafﬁn embedded specimens of the ileum and the ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes . 
The data provide evidence for a higher T helper 2 cell driven immune response in the control group compared to the E. faecium treated group ( P < 0.05 ) in CD4 + magnetically sorted lymphocytes from the ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes at two and 28 days post infection . 
We did not observe differences for CD25 + cells in immunohistochemistry and ﬂow cytometry between E. faecium fed pigs and the control group , but provided a detailed description of the occurrence and morphology of these cells in the gut associate lymphoid tissues of piglets . 
In conclusion we suggest that ( i ) prolonged feeding with E. faecium can result in changes of the T helper cell response leading to a stronger infection with S. Typhimurium and ( ii ) that it is important to examine puriﬁed immune cells to be able to detect effects on T helper cell subpopulations .

1. Introduction
In the past , antibiotic additives were widely used to prevent infection outbreaks in pig populations . 
This resulted in the development of bacterial resistances against many antibiotics , and ﬁnally the European Union ( EU ) banned their use in pig feed in 2006 ( Regulation1831/2003 , 2003 ) . 
Since then , much interest has been raised on the potential use of alternatives such as probiotics , which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health beneﬁt to the host ( FAO/WHO , 2001 ) . 
Probiotics are believed to possess beneﬁcial effects on the gastrointestinal tract of farm animals . 
Among the different modes of action , modulation of the mucosal and systemic immune systems is considered to play a major role like e.g. in prophylaxis against infections ( Romeo et al. , 2010 ) . 
The gut-associated lymphoid tissues such as ileal Peyer 's patches and lymph nodes harbor a large pool of the body 's lymphoid cells and are an important ﬁrst barrier against intestinal pathogens like Salmonella ( Forchielli and Walker , 2005 ) . 
Lactic acid producing bacteria , such as several strains of lactobacilli and some enterococci , are in the focus of research as they are traditionally used in a broad range of industrial food fermentation processes with a long history of safe use . 
Former studies provided evidence that Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 ( E. faecium ) reduces the Chlamydia load of healthy piglets ( Pollmann et al. , 2005 ; Saxelin et al. , 2005 ) . 
Furthermore , experiments in piglets fed with E. faecium have shown a reduction of diarrhea ( Taras et al. , 2006 ; Zeyner and Boldt , 2006 ) . 
Those reports suggested a potential ben-eﬁcial effect of using E. faecium as a probiotic to reduce infectious diseases in pigs . 
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is the predominant causative agent responsible for salmonellosis outbreaks in humans in the EU ( EFSA , 2010 ) . 
Therefore , S. Typhimurium is an important pathogen for humans . 
Because pigs are natural carriers of Salmonella and can transfer them to humans , reduction of the Salmonella infection load in pigs would be desirable . 
However , previous studies demonstrated increased shedding of Salmonella in pigs fed E. faecium ( Szabo et al. , 2009 ; Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
A ﬁrst publication concentrated on the determination of anti-S . 
Typhimurium IgG as well as the levels of T cells , T cells and IgM + B cells obtained by ﬂow cytometry within the circulating blood and in the different tissues of the gut associated lymphoid tissue ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
Additionally , the effect of E. faecium on the performance and feed intake of weaned pigs was studied . 
In that approach , no protective effect of feeding E. faecium to weaned pigs infected with S. Typhimurium could be observed ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
Since there are opposing results in the literature ( Taras et al. , 2006 ; Zeyner and Boldt , 2006 ) it is of high importance to study the underlying mechanisms of the action of E. faecium . 
One attempt to better understand the effect of E. faecium is the examination of the diverse acting T helper ( Th ) cell subpopulations . 
These subpopulations have special molecular requirements for the development of the different lineages of effector CD4 + T helper cells , which include a speciﬁc cytokine milieu during their activation as well as speciﬁc sets of transcription factors ( Deenick and Tangye , 2007 ) . 
The subpopulations can be distinguished by their speciﬁc master transcription factors . 
Th1 cells express the transcription factor TBET , Th2 cells express GATA3 ( Glimcher and Murphy , 2000 ) , and regulatory T helper cells ( Tregs ) express the transcription factor FOXP3 ( Fontenot et al. , 2003 ) . 
Tregs are described as CD4 + CD25 + T lymphocytes expressing FOXP3 with the ability to down regulate various immune responses . 
They are also present in pigs and described with the same phenotype like in humans ( Kaeser et al. , 2008 ) . 
FOXP3 takes part in the development and function of Tregs . 
It induces up-regulation of CD25 and other Treg cell associated molecules and the suppression of effector T cells ( Letourneau et al. , 2009 ) . 
CD25 is the alpha-chain of the IL-2 receptor and , if expressed together with the two other chains of the receptor , is referred to as trimeric high afﬁnity receptor which is found on Tregs and activated T cells . 
Lower levels of CD25 have also been detected on other immune cells , including pre-B cells , thymocytes and NK cells , as well as on certain non-immune cell lines ( Letourneau et al. , 2009 ) . 
The aim of the present study was to test the effect of E. faecium on T helper cells with respect to a challenge with S. Typhimurium . 
In order to obtain information on the differentiated immune response , we determined the expression of lineage speciﬁc T helper cell subtype master transcription factors by means of a real-time PCR . 
The expression of the lineage speciﬁc transcription factors on mRNA level was either measured in the whole tissue or in magnetic sorted T helper cells . 
In addition to the mRNA expression analyses , we measured the CD25 expression of cells from whole tissues by ﬂow cytometry . 
The in situ tissue distribution and morphology of CD25 + cells was shown by immunohistochemistry in parafﬁn embedded specimens . 
2. Methods
2.1. Animals, sampling and bacterial strains
The experimental design , sampling and the used bacterial strains have been described elsewhere ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
Brieﬂy , German Landrace piglets ( N = 32 ) from two control sows and three E. faecium fed sows were weaned at 28 days ( d ) of age and randomly pair wise allocated to pens accounting for sex and litter . 
The feed in the probio-tic treated group ( P , n = 16 ) contained E. faecium NCIMB 10415 , a commercial probiotic feed additive ( Cylactin ® LBC ME10 , DSM nutritional Products Ltd , Switzerland ) . 
Piglets of the control group ( C , n = 16 ) were fed the same basic feed without E. faecium . 
Feed supplemented with E. faecium was provided to sows of the P group already from three weeks before parturition , and piglets of the P group were offered the E. faecium added feed from the age of 12 days on . 
At the age of 38 days all piglets were challenged with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 by intragastric application of a dosage of 1.4 -- 2.1 × 1010 colony-forming units . 
Six piglets from each group were sacriﬁced 2 dpi and the other piglets 28 dpi . 
The experiment was approved by the local authority ( Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales , Berlin ) under the ID : G0348/09 . 
Blood for the isolation of peripheral bloo mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was taken via cardiac puncture under ketamine/azaperone anesthesia ( 4 mg/kg ; 25 mg/kg bodyweight ) . 
During necropsy , ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes ( ILLN ) , ileal Peyer 's patches ( ILPP ) and the papilla ilealis ( PAPIL ) were taken and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 3 min after death of the animal . 
Leukocytes were isolated by 70 m Cell Strainer ( Becton Dickinson GmbH , Heidelberg ) as described before ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012b ) and puriﬁed by centrifugation in a ﬁcoll gradient . 
For histochemistry and immunohistochemistry , tissue samples of ileum and ILLN were collected from animals 2 dpi , rinsed in ice cooled Ringer solution and opened longitudinally along the mesenterial side . 
The tissues were trimmed to about 2 cm × 1 cm rectangular pieces , and pinned on cork with the mucosal side up . 
They were immediately ﬁxed for ∼ 26 h in Zamboni ' ﬁxation solution . 
2.2. Magnetic cell sorting
with an anti-CD4 antibody ( 1:50 , Southern Biotech ) and washed . 
Afterwards the cells were incubated for 15 min with 10 l of anti-FITC Microbeads ( Miltenyi ® ) and 90 l phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
After washing , the cell suspension was transferred on MACS © Separation Columns , which were placed in a magnetic ﬁeld . 
CD4 negative cells run through the columns and were collected . 
The columns were rinsed three times with 2 ml PBS before they were removed from the magnetic ﬁeld . 
Afterwards , CD4 + cells , which were labeled with the magnetic beads and hold back in the column , were pressed through the column with a pistol . 
An aliquot was taken from representative samples to check the accuracy of the magnetic sorting by ﬂow cytometry . 
The CD4 negative and positive cell fractions were suspended in TRIzol ® Reagent ( Invitrogen ) . 
Samples were stored at − 80 ◦ C. Puriﬁed and isolated leukocytes were stained for 30 min 
2.3. Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry ( FCM ) was performed with puriﬁed leukocytes and with magnetic sorted T helper cell populations for the immune cell antigens CD25 and CD4 . 
CD25 was detected using unlabeled primary antibody ( Biozol , clone K231 .3 B2 ) followed by washing and incubation with a ﬂuorescence-labeled secondary antibody ( APC-IgG1 , Southern Biotech ) , whereas the CD4 + cells were stained with primary anti-CD4 conjugates ( Southern Biotech , clone 74-12-4 ) in a one step-incubation . 
For each reaction , 1 6 × 10 cells were exposed to saturating concentrations of the antibodies . 
Per sample , 40,000 lymphocytes were assayed by FCM using a BD FACSCaliburTM ﬂow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) . 
From these cells only living ones , which were negative for propidium iodide staining ( 0.5 g/ml ) , were further analyzed . 
2.4. Gene expression in tissue and isolated lymphocytes
Tissue samples were homogenized in TRIzol ® Reagent with the FastPrep-24 Instrument ( MP Biomedicals ) and total RNA was isolated following manufacturer ' instruction . 
The integrity of total RNA was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) following manufacturer ' instruction or visualized on a 1 % agarose gel . 
Only RNA samples with a RNA integrity number higher than 7.5 were taken for quantiﬁcation . 
The quantity was measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ( PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH ) . 
1 g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using AfﬁnityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Agilent ) with oligo ( dT ) primers . 
RPL19 and TBP were used as invariant endogenous control genes for every sample on each plate . 
The primers and their source are described in Table 1 . 
Primers for FOXP3 , GATA3 , IL-4 , IFN and TGFˇ were designed using Primer3 ( http://frodo.wi.mit.edu ) . 
The quantitative real-time PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 l containing 6 mol forward primer , 6 mol reverse primer , 20 ng cDNA and 5 l SYBR Select Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
The ampliﬁcation protocol included a 10 min denaturation step at ◦ 95 C , followed by 40 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95 ◦ C , 20 s at 60 ◦ C and 40 s at 72 ◦ C . 
The quantiﬁcation of the transcript amounts was performed with a ViiATM 7 Real-time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
The data were assessed with the ViiATM 7 Software . 
Three technical replicates were measured per target gene , two technical replicates per endogenous control gene . 
Relative transcript amounts were calculated using a relative quantiﬁcation method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . 
To calculate the relative expression of the target genes , the mean values of the threshold cycle values ( CT ) of the two endogenous genes RPL19 and TBP were subtracted from the mean CT of the target gene to get the dCT as result . 
To compare the relative gene expression among the different tissues and sampling dates , the mean value of the dCT values of the ILPP from four control animals , sampled 2dpi were applied as external calibrator to calculate the CT. . 
For the comparison of transcript amounts within PBMCs and in CD4 + magnetic sorted lymphocytes between the control and E. faecium fed group , the mean value of the dCT values of control animals of CD4 − magnetic sorted lymphocytes was applied as external calibrator to calculate the CT. . 
The results are shown as relative expression = 2 − CT. .

2.5. Tissue processing for histochemistry and immunohistochemistry
The ﬁxed tissues were rinsed in PBS , afterwards dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol , followed by xylene and embedded in parafﬁn . 
Sections ( 5 m ) were cut , put on HistoBond ® slides ( Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co. . 
KG , Lauda Königshofen , Germany ) , de-waxed in xylene , rehydrated and stained accordingly to standard staining protocols for hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) ( Mulisch and Welsch , 2010 ) , and panoptic Pappenheim staining for tissues ( Romeis , 1989 ) . 
A protocol was optimized for the applied immunohistochemistry . 
The ﬁxed tissue sections were rehydrated and rinsed in Tris -- buffered saline ( TBS : 0.05 M Tris -- HCl pH 7.6 + 0.9 % NaCl ) . 
Tissue was then surrounded with a hydrophobic barrier using a barrier pen ( S2002 , Dako Deutschland GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) . 
They were again rinsed in TBS and then stored in TBS for 1 h until further processing . 
Slides were rinsed in TBS + Tween 20 ( TBST : TBS + 0.05 % Tween 20 ) and then preincubated for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) with TBST + 20 % Swine Normal Serum ( SwNS , S-4000 , LINARIS Biologische Produkte GmbH , Dossenheim , Germany ) . 
The mouse anti pig CD25 antibody ( MaPigCD25 , Clone K231 , BZL20238 , BIOZOL Diagnostica Vertrieb GmbH , Eching , Germany ) diluted 1:20 in antibody dilution buffer ( TBST + 10 % SwNS ) was applied for 45 min at RT and then over night at 4 ◦ C. Mouse-IgG1 ( DAKO X0931 , Dako Deutschland GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) diluted 1:20 in antibody dilution buffer and buffer only served as controls . 
After incubation , slides were rinsed in TBST and in TBS . 
3 % H2O2 in TBS was applied for 20 min at RT as peroxidase-block . 
Slides were rinsed in TBS and TBST . 
DAKO EnVision + - System/HRP labeled goat-anti-mouse-polymer ( DAKO K4001 , Dako Deutschland GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) was applied for 30 min at RT in the dark . 
Slides were rinsed in TBST , TBS and PBS . 
HRP was detected with DAB for 30 min at RT in the dark . 
After rinsing in PBS and distilled water , sections were stained with Mayer 's Haemalaun for 12 s , dehydrated in ethanol and xylene and then mounted with Entellan ® ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) . 
All incubation steps were carried out in a humid chamber . 
2.6. Parameters assessed by light microscopy and digital imaging
Slides were examined under a light microscope ( Axioplan , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) and digitalized live pictures were transferred and analyzed on a monitor . 
CD25 dim ( weak-moderate staining intensity ) and CD25 high ( strong staining intensity ) positive cells were manually counted at a 400-fold magniﬁcation in different compartments of the ileum : lamina propria within villus ; lamina propria in crypt region ; dome region of Peyer 's patches ; within follicles ; upper interfollicular area ; lower interfollicular area . 
Due to severe villous atrophy in some specimens , the compartment `` lamina propria within villi '' could not be taken into account for all ileal samples . 
Therefore a score for villous atrophy was applied ( Supplemental Fig . 
S1 ) ; at a score of 3 this compartment could not be analyzed further ( 0 -- intact villi ; 1 -- villi shortened by one to two quarters of length of intact villus ; 2 -- villi shortened by three quarters ; 3 -- no remaining villi ) . 
In lymph nodes , the CD25 dim cells and CD25 high cells were counted in the following regions : peritrabecular sinus ; paracortex ; secondary follicles ; medullary region . 
In each region at least 0.1 2 mm were evaluated , using the computer assisted image analysis program NIS-Elements AR ( Nikon Instruments Inc. , U.S.A. ) . 
To simplify the recognition of positively stained cells , the colors were enhanced via automatic look-up tables ( LUTs ) and a region of interest ( ROI ) was set for the camera thus cropping a detail of a larger picture . 
As a ﬁrst step the total cell number in this ROI was counted automatically via a threshold for color , shape and size of the cell nuclei per area . 
The density of cells in the respective area was recorded as the percentage of this ROI that was covered with cell nuclei . 
Number of CD25 dim cells and CD25 high cells was ﬁnally calculated per 1 mm2 . 
Additionally the number of CD25 + cells was calculated as percentage of all cells of the respective region in the ileum and lymph node . 
The morphology of CD25 + cells was evaluated at 1000 × magniﬁcation . 
H&E and Pappenheim staining of tissue sections allowed diagnosis of pathological changes of tissues and cells .

2.7. Statistical analysis
The expression data were analyzed with SAS ( version 9.3 ; SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina , USA ) . 
Type III analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was carried out as generalized linear model because normal distribution was given for the error terms but their variances were not equally distributed . 
Class variables were sex , age , feeding group and tissue . 
The Shapiro -- Wilk test was used to determine normal distribution of raw data . 
Because raw data were not normally distributed , the Wilcoxon -- Man -- Whitney test was used to determine signiﬁcant differences between age classes and feeding groups over all tissues and per tissue . 
Furthermore , differences between age classes per feeding group and tissue were analyzed . 
Histological results were analyzed by means of t-test , performed with IBM SPSS 21 ( IBM Deutschland GmbH , Ehningen , Germany ) for differences between the feeding groups . 
3. Results
3.1. Magnetic sorting of porcine lymphocytes
The indirect approach to sort porcine lymphocytes worked well for ileal lymphocytes . 
After the magnetic sorting 95 -- 99 % of the CD4 + lymphocytes were in the positive sorted fraction and 94 -- 98 % CD4 negative lymphocytes were present in the negative sorted fraction ( Supplemental Fig . 
S2 ) . 
For blood derived lymphocytes the indirect approach was less effective than for ileal lymphocytes . 
After magnetic sorting 70 -- 75 % of CD4 + sorted cells were CD4 positive , whereas 85 -- 90 % of the negative sorted lymphocytes were negative for CD4 ( Supplemental Fig . 
S2 ) .

3.2. T helper cell subpopulations characterized by transcript amounts in tissue and magnetic sorted lymphocytes
An ANOVA analyses performed over all tissues revealed that feed supplementation with E. faecium affected transcript amounts of the master transcription factors FOXP3 ( P < 0.002 ) and GATA3 ( P < 0.009 ) ( Table 2 ) . 
The sex had no inﬂuence on the gene expression ( 0.250 < P < 0.591 ) . 
Time after infection of the piglets with S. Typhimurium had an inﬂuence on the expression of FOXP3 ( P < 0.013 ) , whereas the expression of TBET and GATA3 did not change . 
No differences on the relative expression of TBET , FOXP3 and GATA3 were found after E. faecium supplementation in whole tissues of ILLN , ILPP , PAPIL and isolated PBMCs ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , signiﬁcant differences of the expression levels of FOXP3 and GATA3 were found between the two groups if CD4 sorted lymphocyte fractions from the ILLN were analyzed , whereas TBET was not affected ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) . 
Additionally , ANOVA of relative expression of the master transcription factors TBET , FOXP3 and GATA3 revealed signiﬁcant differences between tissues ( P < 0.0001 ) and also the differences of transcript amounts between groups and the transcript amounts itself were greater in the sorted lymphocytes compared to those of whole tissues ( P < 0.01 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
For further information about the observed effect in the CD4 + lymphocytes also the transcript amount of cytokines , which were associated to the differentiation process of T cells , were analyzed in the sorted cell fractions and PBMCs . 
This panel together with the master transcription factors was analyzed separately . 
In line with the ﬁrst analyses the transcript amount of GATA3 and correspondingly of IL-4 were signiﬁcantly higher in the control group compared to the E. faecium supplemented group in CD4 + sorted lymphocytes ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Moreover the transcript amount of IL-2 was also higher in control animals compared to E. faecium fed piglets , but did not reach the signiﬁcant level . 
The transcript amount of FOXP3 was signiﬁcantly lower in the Probiotic group than in the control group , but TGFˇ1 and IL-10 were not affected ( Fig. 2 ) . 
There is a tendency of higher transcript amounts for IL-10 at 2 dpi in the E. faecium fed piglets than in the controls . 
The transcript amounts of TBET and IFN were generally low and not affected by the probiotic treatment ( Fig. 2 ) .

No effect of probiotic feeding on the presence of CD25 high , CD25 dim and CD25 negative stained leukocytes of ILLN and ILPP could be seen by ﬂow cytometric analyses ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Independently of the treatment there were around ﬁve times more CD25 dim expressing cells in comparison to CD25 high expressing cells present . 
The relative cell counts are shown in Fig. 3 .

Frequently in the interfollicular Morphological examination revealed strongly CD25 + cells resembling lymphocytes , i.e. , cells with a diameter of around 7 -- 10 m , a compact body , round nucleus and areas of ileal Peyer ' patches -- but also in other localizations -- shape of CD25 + cells was polygonal to irregular , resembling amoeboid cells . 
CD25 + cells often were in close contact with neighboring positive and negative cells as demonstrated in Fig. 4B . 
Additionally , in the paracortex of the lymph nodes and in the interfollicular region and sinuses of the ileum , larger moderately positive cells with numerous projections and big round nuclei were found ( Fig. 4C and F ) . 
Distribution of CD25 + cells in the ileum and in the corresponding mesenteric lymph nodes showed a characteristic and typical pattern ( Figs. 5 and 6 ) . 
In the ileum , most positive cells were found in the upper interfollicular region . 
In the lymph node the highest amounts were observed in the paracortical area ( Fig. 7 ) . 
General cell density and absolute numbers of cells in the respective areas are summarized in Supplemental Fig .

4. Discussion
The aim of the present study was ﬁrstly to unravel a potential probiotic effect of E. faecium with respect to challenge with S. Typhimurium on the immune response in weaned piglets of the German Landrace breed and secondly to investigate the location of immune cells in the lymphatic tissues associated to the ileum by different ancillary techniques . 
Animal performance and data on shedding of S. Typhimurium were presented elsewhere ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
Shortly , feeding E. faecium resulted in higher fecal shedding of S. Typhimurium and higher tissue load up to 28 dpi . 
To further examine the effects of the probiotic treatment on speciﬁc immune cell subsets in the ileu associate lymphatic structures immunohistochemistry , ﬂow cytometry and quantitative real time PCR were applied . 
The marker CD25 was assessed on protein level and the lineage speciﬁc transcription factors GATA3 , FOXP3 and TBET were measured on transcript level in tissue of ileal Peyer 's Patch , ileal lymph node and papilla as well as in puriﬁed PBMCs and magnetic sorted leukocytes from the ileal lymph nodes ( Fig. 1 ) . 
All in all , there were far higher expression levels ( 20 -- 120 times ) of FOXP3 and GATA3 and higher expression levels ( 6 -- 11 times ) of TBET in the sorted lymphocyte fractions compared to the expression levels of the whole tissue samples of ILLN , ILPP and PAPIL . 
The RNA was isolated from frozen whole tissue samples ; whereas the sorted cells were mechanically isolated and puriﬁed by a Ficoll gradient prior to the sort . 
As expected , the puriﬁed and sorted samples contained more lymphoid cells than the analyzed whole gut associated lymphoid tissue . 
All three analyzed whole tissue samples showed no differences for the transcript amounts of the master transcription factors describing T helper cell subpopulations between piglets with or without E. faecium supplementation . 
However when lymphocytes were puriﬁed from the tissues , and in particular if CD4 + T helper cells were enriched via magnetic sorting , we found higher relative transcript amounts of GATA3 and FOXP3 in the control group compared to the E. faecium supplemented group ; the transcript amount of TBET in the CD4 + T helper cell fraction was not affected ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) . 
The high expression of GATA3 and the low expression of TBET are characteristic for Th2 proliferation in activated T helper cells ( Kanhere et al. , 2012 ) . 
Albeit FOXP3 is typical for Tregs , it is like the surface marker CD25 ( Malek and Castro , 2010 ) transiently expressed in low amount in antigen-activated T cells ( Miyao et al. , 2012 ) . 
And indeed , a further examination on protein level of cells expressing CD25 in ileal lymph nodes of both feeding groups showed a higher relative count of CD25 dim expressing cells ( 39 % ) in comparison to CD25 high expressing cells ( 8 % ) . 
Therefore , we assume that the proportion of activated T helper cells was high in both feeding groups ( Fig. 3 ) . 
There was neither a probiotic treatment effect on the relative cell count of CD25 high or CD25 dim cells nor on CD25 + cells . 
To exclude that the missing probiotic effect on CD25 cells is not due to the method , additionally the distribution and morphology of CD25 + cells in the tissue samples was examined by immunohistochemistry of parafﬁn embedded specimens . 
Immunohistochemistry allowed the in situ location of those cell types analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . 
The morphology of strongly CD25 + cells resembled that of lymphocytes and their distribution pattern in the ileum and also in the corresponding mesenteric lymph nodes was typical for T cells , i.e. small round cells in the interfollicular areas in the ileum and the paracortex of the lymph nodes ( Charerntantanakul and Roth , 2007 ) . 
Occasionally larger and moderately stained cells were found . 
These cells could be myeloid precursors which are known to express CD25 ( Gazzola et al. , 1992 ; Gönen et al. , 2012 ) and which can also be present in lymphoid tissues as described for dendritic cell precursors ( Randolph et al. , 2008 ) . 
Often the CD25 + cells were found in close contact with surrounding cells suggesting cell -- cell-interaction which is required for some functions of Tregs ( Nakamura et al. , 2001 ) . 
The irregular shape of CD25 + cells and their cellular projections may point towards amoeboid migration of these cells ( Willard-Mack , 2006 ) . 
A part of these CD25 + active looking and intensely stained cells in the ileal interfollicular areas and in the paracortex of the lymph nodes as well as the larger positively stained cells found in blood and lymphoid vessels may represent macrophages ( Choy et al. , 1990 ) or dendritic cells ( Randolph et al. , 2008 ) since this cell type can also express CD25 . 
CD25 + cells which were found in lymph sinuses and blood vessels also resembled lymphocytes ready for traveling in lymph and blood . 
The aggregation of the leukocytes in the investigated tissues indicated inﬂammation , conﬁrming active reaction of the immune system towards the Salmonella infection . 
to be signiﬁcantly different between the feeding groups . 
This is in agreement with the ﬂow cytometry results for the CD25 antibody . 
In general a higher percentage of cells was found to be CD25 + by the ﬂow cytometric analyses , although the same antibody was used for The numbers of positively stained cells were not found immunohistochemistry . 
A potential reason for this could be the use of puriﬁed leukocytes for the ﬂow cytometric analyses versus whole tissue sections for immunohistochemistry . 
If comparing immunohistochemistry and ﬂow cytometry it is necessary to mention the potentially biasing inﬂuence of tissue architecture and in situ distribution of the analyzed cell populations across tissues . 
As demonstrated for the ileum as well as for the lymph node , the CD25 + cells clearly show a distinct localization . 
In the ILLNs , most of the positive cells were found in the paracortex , which is the compartment with the highest cell density . 
Most leukocytes detected via ﬂow cytometry is therefore derived from this compartment . 
In contrast , the most leukocytes from the ileum is derived from the follicles , which take up , by our own estimations , about 43 % of the mucosal tissue space , contain most cells but harbor nearly no CD25 + cells at all . 
Considering this , the targeted population of cells may be underrepresented ( or of course also overrepresented ) in a sample and an important role may be ignored since the population may have an important inﬂu-ence in the speciﬁc compartment where it is more frequent . 
The results show that E. faecium had no detectable effect on the presence and quantity of CD25 + cells at 2 and 28 dpi . 
Since E. faecium effects were evident on Salmonella clearance in piglets and differences in transcript amounts of GATA3 and FOXP3 were found in magnetically sorted lymphocytes from the lymph nodes , we analyzed also the transcript amount of cytokine genes , which are expected to differ due to the differentiation of T helper cells . 
In CD4 + sorted lymphocytes , the higher transcript amount of GATA3 as master transcription factor for Th2 cell differentiation corresponded with signiﬁcantly higher transcript amounts of IL-4 , a cytokine produced by Th2 cells , in the control compared to the E. faecium supplemented group . 
Additionally , the transcript amount of IL-2 , an important cytokine for proliferation and differentiation of T cells , was higher in control animals compared to E. faecium fed piglets . 
Even though this difference was not signiﬁcant , it is conclusive with the overall observation of a lower T helper cell response in the E. faecium fed piglets after weaning . 
The transcript amount of FOXP3 was higher in the control animals . 
Albeit FOXP3 is the lineage speciﬁc master transcription factor for Tregs , it is like the surface marker CD25 ( Malek and Castro , 2010 ) transiently expressed in low amount in antigen-activated T cells ( Miyao et al. , 2012 ) . 
If one analyzes the transcript amount of a pool of cells one does not know whether few cells express FOXP3 highly or whether many cells are activated and therefore express FOXP3 moderately . 
As the FCM analyses revealed a higher relative count of CD25 dim expressing cells ( 39 % ) in comparison to CD25 high expressing cells ( 8 % ) in Salmonella infected piglets , we suppose that a higher FOXP3 expression in the control group is due to a higher relative count of activated T cells in the control group . 
This observation is in line with no group difference in the transcript amount of TGFˇ1 , a cytokine which is important to induce Tregs . 
Additionally , there was also no difference for IL-10 , an antiinﬂammatory cytokine , and only a tendency for a higher transcript amount of IL-10 in the probiotic treated animals 2 dpi was noted , which underlines our assumption

ith a w na prop 
Transcript amounts of TBET , the master transcription factor for Th1 cell differentiation , and IFN , the cytokine which induces Th1 cells and is produced by Th1 cells , were not affected by E. faecium supplementation in this study and were generally very low . 
The observed expression pattern leads to the conclusion that the T helper cells in the control animals were activated to differentiate into Th2 cells . 
The higher Th2 differentiation rate contributes to a Th2 cell driven immune response which in turn potentially leads to a higher B cell immune response , in terms of protective production of antibodies in the gut . 
Infections with S. Typhimurium belong to the few infections of facultative intracellular bacteria , for which is already described that besides an appropriate T cell response also a B cell response plays a major role in the immune defense ( Mittrucker et al. , 2000 ) . 
Therefore the higher Th2 associated immune response in the control group could explain the better Salmonella clearance of the control group compared to the E. faecium treated group reported previously ( Kreuzer et al. , 2012a ) . 
In addition Siepert et al. ( 2014 ) found a delayed proliferative response of puriﬁed blood mononuclear cells from E. faecium-fed piglets to stimulation with Salmonella antigens . 
Furthermore , these authors also recorded a deregulation of intestinal immune responses , in means of post-weaning anti-inﬂammatory response , which could delay the host response to infections after prolonged supplementation of the piglets with E. faecium . 
The ﬁndings of Siepert et al. ( 2014 ) are related to the same animals that provided the samples for the presented study . 
They remain in line with our observations of the higher transcript amount of GATA3 , IL-4 and FOXP3 and therefore higher proliferation rate of Th2 cells in the control animals compared to the E. faecium-fed piglets . 
Summarizing , the present study provides evidence for differences in the activation of ileocecal mesenteric lymph node T helper cells in pigs fed E. faecium compared to the control group after a challenge with S. Typhimurium . 
Higher transcript amounts of GATA3 and IL-4 and low levels of TBET and IFN support a higher Th2 driven immune response in the control group , which in turn means , that there was a lower Th2 driven immune response in the probiotic group . 
The higher Th2 response in the control group could lead to the better Salmonella clearance reported previously . 
Hence , prolonged feeding with E. faecium may result in an impaired immune response to Salmonella . 
This difference could be observed only in magnetic sorted lymphocytes , not in whole tissue samples . 
Thus , it is important to examine proposed immune effects in puriﬁed immune cells to be able to ﬁnd these effects .
