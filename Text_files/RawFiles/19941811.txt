Abstract -- Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes enteric disease and compromises food safety . 
In pigs , the molecular response of the intestine to S. typhimurium has been traditionally characterized by in vitro models that do not reﬂect the actual immunological competence of the intestinal mucosa . 
In this work , we performed an oral S. typhimurium infection study to obtain insight into the in vitro response in three different sections ( jejunum , ileum and colon ) of the porcine intestine . 
For this , samples from one-month-old infected piglets were collected during a time course comprising 1 , 2 , and 6 days post inoculation to evaluate the intestinal response by quantifying the mRNA expression of gene coding for 28 innate immune system molecules using quantitative real-time PCR assays . 
In addition , samples from non-infected control animals were also employed to establish differences in the steady state gene expression between intestinal sections . 
The panel of quantiﬁed molecules included an assortment of cytokines , chemokines , pattern-recognition receptors , intracellular signaling molecules , transcription factors and antimicrobial molecules . 
Changes in gene expression occurred in the three different parts of the intestine and during the course of the S. typhimurium infection . 
Moreover , the high variation observed in expression patterns of genes coding for inﬂammatory mediators could indicate that each intestinal section responds differently to the infection . 
Thus , on the contrary to ﬁndings in the jejunum and colon , a down-regulation and lack of induction of some proinﬂammatory cytokine transcripts was observed in the ileum . 
Nevertheless , all chemoattractant cytokines assayed were up-regulated in the ileum and jejunum whereas only interleukin-8 and MIP-1a mRNA were over expressed in the colon . 
In conclusion , our results reveal regional differences in gene expression proﬁles along the porcine intestinal gut as well as regional differences in the inﬂammatory response to S. typhimurium infection . 
Taken together , these data should provide a basis for a complete understanding of the porcine intestinal response to bacterial infection . 
Salmonella / pig / intestinal gut / immune response / real-time PCR 
1. INTRODUCTION
health . 
In pigs , this threat is double , since it not only causes economical losses due to anian infection of the lining of the small and large intestine [ 12 ] . 
Phagocytic cells , including macrophages , neutrophils and dendritic cells ( DC ) are critical components of the innate immune response to S. typhimurium [ 33 ] . 
In addition , although the intestinal epithelium has been traditionally identiﬁed only as a physical barrier against luminal bacteria , more recently , intestinal epithelial cells are considered as a source of chemokines , cyto-kines and other immunomodulators which lead to the recruitment of phagocytic cells to initiate both innate and adaptative immune responses [ 26 ] . 
The role as a sentinel of infection is developed by intestinal epithelial cells through the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMP ) by the pattern-recognition receptors ( PRR ) expressed on its cellular membranes [ 8 ] . 
Salmonella contain several PAMP , including lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , peptidoglycan , mannose and ﬂagellin capable of activating an epithelial proinﬂammatory gene program in the gut [ 35 ] . 
In vitro studies have shown that Salmonella interaction with porcine epithelial cells results in a proinﬂammatory response characterized by the release of several cytokines and chemo-kines [ 2 , 28 , 30 , 32 ] . 
However , although these in vitro models can provide valuable information , it is clear that a cell culture approach can not deﬁne the physiological relevance of such cellular responses . 
In the intestine , different specialized cell types are present at the epithelial level , including enterocytes ( absorptive cells ) , globet cells ( mucus producing cells ) , M-cells ( antigen sampling cells ) and Paneth cells ( secretory intestinal cells ) [ 14 , 15 ] . 
In addition , the mucosal immunity involves multiple cell types that reside at the site of infection or inﬁltrate from the circulation , establishing a complex communication network between them in the form of soluble and cell-bound molecules . 
Thus , DC form an extensive network in the lamina propia of the small as well as the large intestine . 
Mucosal DC constantly survey the luminal microenvironment which contains commensal microbiota and potentially harmful organisms regulating pathogen recognition and adaptative as well as innate defense activation [ 24 ] . 
On the contrary , resident and recruited macrophages , neutrophils and lymphocytes complete the plethora of cell types interacting in the intestinal mucosa . 
In this framework , it is clear that the response against luminal patho-gens characterized by in vitro assays could not reﬂect the actual immunological competence of the intestinal mucosa . 
In order to contribute to the knowledge of the porcine in vivo response to Salmonella , in this work , we pursued the characterization of the early immune response to S. typhimurium infection along the intestinal tract , focusing on mucosa response . 
To achieve this , an experimental infection covering from early times after infection ( 1 and 2 days ) to middle times ( 6 days ) was designed . 
Then , the mucosal immune response was evaluated by quantiﬁcation of the relative mRNA expression of genes coding for molecules with a relevant function in innate immunity including the following : cytokines , chemokines , PRR , intracellular signaling mole-cules , transcription factors and antimicrobial molecules . 
Salmonellosis caused by the non-host - mal weakening and underproduction , but also adapted bacteria Salmonella enterica subspe - due to the well-known public health risk of cies enterica serovar Typhimurium is an commercializing Salmonella infected pork important disease in animal safety and human products [ 3 ] . 
The symptomatology of salmonellosis by S. typhimurium is similar in humans * Corresponding author : ge1gapaj@uco.es and pigs , and it is characterized by enterocolitis , This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any noncommercial medium , provided the original work is properly cited .

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Bacterial strain
The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium phagetype DT104 was an isolate from a carrier pig [ 11 ] . 
This isolate was serotyped using slide agglutination with antisera purchased from Bio-Rad ( Hercules , CA , USA ) . 
Phage typing was performed in accordance with the methods of the Spanish National Reference Laboratory , Algete , Madrid , Spain . 
Bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani ( LB ) broth to log stationary phase at 250 rpm , 37 C for 8 h to an OD600 nm of 0.8 . 
After harvesting by centrifugation at 8 000 g , the bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of 108 cfu/mL in PBS . 
2.2. Experiment design and disease progress
Sixteen male and female crossbred weaned pig-lets , approximately 4 weeks of age , were used . 
Before infection , faecal samples from each animal were analyzed to conﬁrm that piglets were free of Salmonella . 
Pigs were housed in an environmentally controlled isolation facility at 25 C and under constant light with ad libitum access to feed and water . 
After an acclimation period of 5 days , pigs were challenged orally with 108 cfu of S. typhimurium ( n = 12 ) , whereas the control group ( n = 4 ) received sterile medium orally . 
The four non-infected control pigs were necropsied 2 h prior to experimental infection . 
Four randomly chosen infected pigs were necropsied at each time point of 1 day post-infection ( dpi ) , 2 dpi and 6 dpi , respectively . 
Faecal swabs , blood and tissue samples were aseptically collected . 
The jejunum , ileum and colon were independently sectioned in pieces of around 10 cm and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for mucosa isolation and RNA puriﬁcation ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Serum samples were frozen for use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) assays . 
All the infected animals were fecal-culture positive for Salmonella and developed similar clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease , including increased rectal temperature , diarrhea and lethargy . 
All procedures involving animals respected European regulations regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientiﬁc purposes .

The same letters above the bars indicate no signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0.05 ) . 
2.3. Serum ELISA
Serum samples were harvested in polypropylene tubes and stored at 20 C until use . 
ELISA was used for serum interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) analysis using Swine IL-8 and Swine TNF-a ELISA kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , respectively , according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Respective standard curves were used to determine the amounts ( pg/mL ) of each cytokine in the porcine serum samples . 
IL-8 and TNF-a levels were measured both in control and infected pigs at each sampling time ( Fig. 2 ) . 
2.4. Intestinal mucosa isolation and RNA puriﬁcation
All 48 samples ( intestinal sections and sampling times , Fig. 1 ) were independently processed for mucosa isolation and RNA puriﬁcation . 
Two cm in length of each intestinal sample stored at 80 C was treated with RNAlater - ICE ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Thirty mg of intestinal mucosa were isolated by scraping the luminal surface with a razor and homogenization in 600 lL of RLT buffer ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) using a rotor-stator homogenizer . 
Further RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Eluted RNA was treated with DNase using a TURBO DNA-free Kit ( Ambion ) . 
Treated RNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 volume 3 M NaOAc , pH 5.2 and 2.5 volumes ethanol and incubating at 80 C overnight . 
RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 16 000 g and washed with 75 % ethanol twice . 
RNA was resuspended in RNase free water , quantiﬁed using a Nano-DropTM1000 Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Wilmington , DE , USA ) and diluted to obtain a RNA concentration of 1 lg/lL . 
RNA integrity was evaluated using denaturing agarose gels after each step of the puriﬁcation procedure : after column elution , DNase treatment , and after sodium acetate precipitation . 
RNA pools were prepared by mixing equal amounts of RNA from the same intestinal section ( jejunum , ileum or colon ) collected from the four pigs at each time point ( 0 , 1 , 2 or 6 dpi ) , resulting in three control pools ( 0-J , 0-I and 0-C ) and nine infected pools ( 1-J , 1-I , 1-C , 2-J , 2-I , 2-C , 6-J , 6-I and 6-C ) ( Fig. 1 ) .

The same letters above the bars indicate no signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0.05 ) . 
2.5. Primer design for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
qPCR primers used in this work ( Tab . 
I ) were TM designed using Beacon Designer ( Biosoft International , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) based on the cDNA sequences obtained from the GeneBank database . 
Each primer was homology searched by a NCBI BLAST search to ensure that it was speciﬁc for the target mRNA transcript . 
To optimize the ampliﬁcation procedure , all primer pairs were designed to be used at the same annealing temperature ( 57 C ) . 
Melting curves followed by gel electrophoresis were used to conﬁrm product speciﬁcity after PCR cycles . 
2.6. qPCR assays
Pooled RNA ( 1.5 lg ) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit ( Bio-Rad ) in a total volume of 30 lL . 
cDNA solutions were diluted by adding 70 lL of UHQ water obtained from a Milli-Q Plus water system ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) and stored at 20 C. Relative gene expression was determined by qPCR using an iQ5 Thermo Cycler ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Each sample was ampliﬁed by duplication in the same 96 well PCR plate and plates were repeated at least twice . 
Twenty lL real-time PCR reactions were carried out using 2 lL of diluted cDNA as template and the iQTM SYBR Green Supermix ( BioRad ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Final concentration of the primers in the PCR reaction was 0.4 lM . 
The qPCR conditions were 5 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 C , 30 s at 57 C and 45 s at 72 C . 
After ampli-ﬁcation , a melting program was run to verify the presence of only one PCR product . 
To ensure the sensitivity and accuracy of the results obtained by qPCR , internal normalization of the gene expression analysis was carried out using beta-actin and cyclo-philin-A as the internal control genes ( reference genes ) [ 29 ] . 
Previously , to accurately ascertain which reference genes would be the most reliable for use as normalisers in qPCR , we subjected ribosomal 18S RNA , beta-actin and cyclophilin-A expression data to analysis using the BestKeeper tool [ 27 ] . 
The results from the BestKeeper analysis indicate that 18S RNA was the least reliable reference gene in the context of our bacterial experimental infection . 
2.7. Data analysis
Two different approaches were performed for mRNA quantiﬁcation : ( i ) to establish the changes in gene expression that occur in an intestinal section during the experimental infection relative to uninfected controls and ( ii ) to compare the level of target gene expression among different segments of porcine intestine at the non-infected state relative to the expression in the jejunum . 
In both cases , the relative gene expression was assessed by the 2 method DDCt [ 19 ] , in which the PCR cycle used for quantiﬁcation ( Ct , threshold cycle ) has been replaced by the term Cq ( quantiﬁcation cycle ) , according to the recommendations of the RDML ( real-time PCR Data Markup Language ) data standard1 . 
DDCq values were calculated according to the formula DDCq = [ ( CqTGX CqRGX ) Time Y ] [ ( CqTGX CqRGX ) Time 0 ] for the ﬁrst approach and DDCq = [ ( CqTGJ CqRGJ ) Time 0 ] [ ( CqTGX CqRGX ) Time 0 ] for the second , where CqTG is the quantiﬁcation cycle of the target gene , CqRG the geometric mean of the quantiﬁcation cycle of the reference genes , X is any intestinal section , Y is any time point ( dpi ) and J is the jejunum . 
The mean and standard deviation of ratios ( 2 values ) obtained for a gene DDCq in different plates were calculated . 
When the ratio was lower than 1 , which means down-regulation , the fold change was calculated as 1/ratio and a minus sign ( ) was added to denote down-regulation ( Tabs . 
II and III ) . 
With this method , a fold-change value of 1 or 1 represents no difference in gene expression . 
In both approaches , the differences in mRNA expression among groups were assessed by the Student 's paired t-test previous determination of normal distribution of the data and variance homogeneity using SPSS 15.0 software ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) .

3. RESULTS
3.1. Serum levels of IL-8 and TNF-a in swine infected with S. typhimurium
Serum levels of IL-8 and TNF-a ( shown as arithmetic mean levels in pg/mL ) were measured in order to evaluate the host response to the enteric pathogen ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Signiﬁcantly elevated levels of TNF-a ( p < 0.05 ) were noted in all infected animals versus healthy controls , whereas only serum IL-8 levels were signiﬁcantly higher than in uninfected animals ( p < 0.05 ) at 1 and 2 dpi . 
In general , detectable amounts of serum IL-8 were higher than TNF-a levels although these differences were only statistically signiﬁcant at 1 dpi . 
In addition , a time-dependent effect was observed in the protein release of IL-8 and TNF-a with a maximal level of IL-8 production occurring early at 1 dpi when compared with the higher production of TNF-a at 2 dpi . 
3.2. mRNA quantiﬁcation of immune response genes by real-time PCR
To gain insight into the mechanisms of por-cine intestinal defense to bacterial infection , we quantiﬁed the expression of genes coding for 28 immune related molecules including proinﬂammatory and chemoattractant cytokines , PRR , intracellular signaling molecules , transcription factors and antimicrobial molecules after an in vitro experimental infection with S. typhimu-rium . 
Statistically signiﬁcant changes in gene expression relative to uninfected animals are shown in Table II . 
In addition , the expression of the genes was also quantiﬁed in non-infected animals ( steady state ) and the results are shown in Table III . 
3.2.1. Cytokine mRNA expression after S. typhimurium infection
Among cytokines , mRNA expression of chemoattractant cytokines IL-8 , MCP-1 , MIP-1a and MIP-1b were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in the jejunum and ileum . 
In the colon , only changes in IL-8 and MIP-1a gene expression were observed , with an overexpression of their respective mRNA occurring later than in the jejunum and ileum . 
Similarly , mRNA expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-a , IL-1b , IFN-c , IL-6 and IL-12p40 was also analyzed . 
As shown in Table II , TNF-a mRNA was up-regulated in the three porcine intestinal sections whereas IL-1b , IFN-c and IL-6 mRNA were increased in the infected jeju-num and colon but signiﬁcantly down-regulated ( p < 0.01 ) or not induced in the ileum . 
Interestingly , IL-12p40 was up-regulated in the colon but down-regulated in the jejunum , albeit not as markedly as in the ileum . 
Finally , no changes in gene expression of anti-inﬂammatory cyto-kines IL-4 and IL-10 were observed along the porcine intestine in response to S. typhimurium infection . 
3.2.2 . 
Pattern recognition receptor mRNA expression after S. typhimurium infection 
Toll-like receptors ( TLR ) and NOD-like receptors ( NLR ) play an important role in the sensing of Gram-negative bacterial infections . 
Consequently , the mRNA expression of TLR ( TLR-1 to TLR-10 ) , NOD1 and NOD2 was analyzed in our model of experimental S. typhimurium infection . 
In TLR there were very few signiﬁcant changes in gene expression , with the up-regulation of TLR-2 mRNA in the ileum being the most relevant result . 
TLR-4 and TLR-7 mRNA expression were not differentially regulated in the infected intes-tinal tracts whereas a general pattern of downregulation was observed for TLR-1 , TLR-3 , TLR-5 , TLR-9 and TLR-10 genes ( Tab . 
II ) . 
Table II . 
Changes in gene expression relative to uninfected controls within each intestinal section at 1 , 2 and 6 dpi . 
Only genes with statistically signiﬁcant changes are shown .

a Differences were analyzed using the Student 's paired t-test . 
Statistically signiﬁcant changes are in bold : * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 . 
Regarding intracellular NOD receptors , NOD1 gene expression was up-regulated in the jeju-num and ileum whereas NOD2 increased its expression only in the jejunum ( Tab . 
II ) . 
3.2.3. Transcript expression of MyD88, NF-jB and caspase-1 in the porcine intestinal mucosa after S. typhimurium infection
Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( MyD88 ) is an adapter protein that is involved in TLR-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-jB ) which subsequently leads to transcription of proinﬂammatory cyto-kines . 
Caspase-1 is responsible for maturation of certain inﬂammatory cytokines including IL-1b . 
In our study , no changes were observed in MyD88 mRNA expression in any of the intestinal sections analyzed . 
On the contrary , signiﬁcant up-regulation of NF-jB1 gene expression ( p < 0.05 ) and down-regulation of caspase-1 mRNA expression ( p < 0.05 ) were detected in the ileum ( Tab . 
II ) . 
3.2.4 . 
mRNA expression for the antimicrobial peptide b-defensins following experimental S. typhimurium infection 
Mammalian antimicrobial peptides , including b-defensins , represent an ancient arm of innate immunity designed to directly neutralize invading microbes . 
In this work , we examined the effect of S. typhimurium infection over por-cine b-defensin 1 ( PBD-1 ) and 2 ( PBD-2 ) expression along the porcine intestinal gut . 
The results from Table II indicate that PBD-2 mRNA expression was highly down-regulated in the jejunum but over-expressed in the ileum . 
In contrast , PBD-1 mRNA expression was not altered in our experimental infection model . 
3.2.5. Quantiﬁcation of steady state expression of immune genes along the porcine intestinal gut
The aim of this study was to compare the expression of selected innate immune genes ( Tab . 
I ) in three porcine intestinal sections at the steady state . 
The results are given in Table III , in which statistically signiﬁcant changes in gene expression relative to the jeju-num are shown . 
Overall , diverse features of var-iation in gene expression patterns were seen among the jejunum , ileum and colon , particularly due to changes in the expression of proin-ﬂammatory cytokines and TLR . 
Thus , with the exception of TNF-a and IFN-c , we found that all the proinﬂammatory cytokines analyzed were signiﬁcantly more expressed in the ileum than in the jejunum and colon . 
In addition , ileal mucosa also showed the highest levels of mRNA expression of BDF-1 , TLR-9 and TLR-10 . 
On the contrary , mRNA expression of most TLR including TLR-2 , TLR-4 , TLR-7 and TLR-8 was higher in the colon than in the jejunum and ileum . 
Finally , some cytokines such as IL-8 , MIP-1a and IL-4 , as well as the transcription factor NF-jB , were more expressed in the jejunum than in the ileum and colon .

4. DISCUSSION
In this work we aimed to describe the state of the innate immune machinery in the porcine intestinal mucosa after infection with the enter-opathogenic bacteria S. typhimurium . 
To achieve this , we quantiﬁed the expression of genes coding for selected immune-defense mol-ecules in three different sections of the porcine intestinal tract ( jejunum , ileum and colon ) at steady state and at various times post-infection ( 1 , 2 and 6 dpi ) . 
Other approaches mimicking in vivo Salmonella infections have been reported in pigs , i.e. the small intestinal segment perfusion model [ 25 , 31 ] and the gut loop in the ileum or jejunum [ 20 , 21 ] . 
Although highly valuable for minimizing individual variation among animals , these methods do not totally reﬂect the natural intestinal transit or the possible bacterial preference for infection of certain intestinal sections . 
Indeed , none of these procedures have been used to characterize the large intestine response to Salmonella infection . 
Therefore , to our knowledge , our study is the ﬁrst attempt to simultaneously analyze the response of the porcine small and large intestine to an in vivo-induced bacterial infection . 
Our results regarding TNF-a and IL-8 gene expression suggest that all porcine intestinal sections studied were able to sense bacterial presence . 
This was in agreement with the increased levels of IL-8 and TNF-a secretion in the serum of the experimentally infected animals and taken together , data of IL-8 and TNF-a gene and protein expression could indicate that an inﬂammatory process had been triggered along the porcine intestine after infection with S. typhimurium . 
Nevertheless , on the basis of changes in cytokine expression obtained in the present study , the extent of the inﬂammatory response could be varied greatly from the jeju-num to the ileum and colon . 
Thus , some proin-ﬂammatory cytokines with an important role in the control of Salmonella infection such as IL-1b , IFN-c , IL-6 and IL-12p40 [ 7 , 17 ] differed in its mRNA expression among the three intes-tinal sections , showed a lack of induction and even down regulation in the ileum compared to the jejunum and colon ( Tab . 
II ) . 
These results indicate that the ileum mucosa is not prompting the proinﬂammatory burst needed to face up to pathogens , neither by a lower intrinsic capacity of this intestinal section to mount an immune response against the bacteria ; nor as the consequence of a pathogen-induced down-immune-modulation to obtain a successful invasion . 
The ﬁrst assumption seems unlikely in the light of our ﬁnding that the higher basal expression of IL-1b , IL-6 and IL-12p40 mRNA was found in the ileum at steady state ( Tab . 
III ) . 
However , some studies in agreement with the second interpretation , have demonstrated the ability of S. typhimurium to interfere with the host 's inﬂammatory response to promote bacterial pathogenesis [ 4 , 10 ] . 
According to the chemoattractant cytokine expression , our results show that the immune response elapses from the small to the large intestine . 
Thus , the IL-8 and MIP-1a mRNA pattern of expression showed an earlier immune response in the jejunum and ileum than in the colon . 
Also , while in the ileum the expression of the genes remained at a relatively high level until 6 dpi in the jejunum the induction of the gene expression was not observed beyond 2 dpi . 
This evidence could suggest that the recruitment of phagocytes for clearance of pathogen infection was maintained for a longer time in the ileum than in the jejunum , in agreement with previous observations showing that Salmonella colonizes the ileum more efﬁciently than the jejunum , possibly due to the existence of physiological and morphological differences between the two sites [ 3 , 6 ] . 
In agreement with this , Hyland et al. ( 2006 ) [ 13 ] demonstrated that ileal Peyer 's patches undergo a greater inﬂammatory cytokine response 6 h after Salmonella infection than the jejunal Peyer 's patches . 
Several Salmonella PAMP can act as activators of the TLR-2 , -4 , -5 and -9 signaling pathways [ 1 , 16 ] . 
In a recent study , changes in TLR-2 , TLR-4 and TLR-5 mRNA expression were observed in porcine jejunal mucosa upon S. typhimurium infection [ 20 ] . 
In our model of S. typhimurium challenge , those changes were not observed in the jejunum although TLR-2 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased in the ileum . 
We found that most TLR were not differentially regulated along the time course of the infection , suggesting that the expression of these receptors was constitutive in this infection model . 
Nevertheless , all TLR assayed in this study ( except TLR-5 ) were regulated in a previous in vitro assay based on the stimulation of porcine jejunal or ileal cell lines with LPS from S. typhimurium [ 2 ] , indicating that any extrapolation of such in vitro experiments to an in vivo situation should only be made with considerable caution . 
On the contrary , the unequal distribution of TLR-7 , -8 , -9 and -10 at the basal state identiﬁed in the pres-ent work along the intestinal tract ( Tab . 
III ) , could reﬂect different susceptibilities to infection in each intestinal section , although we can not exclude that the morphological differences among the jejunum , ileum and colon might be the cause of such a variation . 
It has been reported that the intracellular NLR are able to sense the intracellular pathogen S. typhimurium and induce a proinﬂammatory response through NF-jB activation [ 7 , 22 ] . 
In this work , NOD1 mRNA expression was upregulated in the jejunum and ileum , while NOD2 mRNA up-regulation was only found in the jejunum . 
How the changes of these NLR will have any impact on the response to intestinal infection has not been well deﬁned . 
However , recently published data indicates that TLR-2 and NOD1 are involved in chemokine production of murine epithelial cell lines in response to Helycobacter muridarum challenge [ 5 ] . 
Interestingly , in our conditions these two genes were the only PRR found up-regulated in the porcine ileum . 
This up-regulation could be pointing towards a role of both molecules also in the response against S. typhimurium . 
NOD1 and NOD2 are able to activate cas-pase-1 , which is responsible for the processing and maturation of the proinﬂammatory cyto-kines IL-1b and IL-18 [ 9 ] . 
The down-regulation of caspase-1 mRNA observed in the ileum in the present work ( Tab . 
II ) is difﬁcult to interpret because , although some authors have reported that a caspase-1 deﬁciency confers resistance to oral infection with S. typhimurium [ 23 ] , others demonstrated that the absence of caspase-1 does not result in resistance to oral infection by S. typhimurium , but rather , leads to increased susceptibility to infection [ 18 ] . 
In pigs , expression analysis of defensins has been assessed in in vitro and in vivo studies with contradictory results . 
Thus , Veldhuizen et al. [ 32 ] showed that PBD-1 and PBD-2 mRNA expression were up-regulated after in vitro infection of porcine intestinal epithelial cell lines with S. typhimurium . 
The same research group reported a lack of up-regulation of PBD-1 and PBD-2 in vivo in the small intestine upon S. typhimurium infection [ 31 ] whereas in a more recent work , Meurens et al. [ 20 ] observed up-regulation of PBD-2 in jejunal Pe-yer 's patches . 
According to these in vivo observations , no changes in PBD-1 mRNA were observed in the present work . 
However , regarding PBD-2 mRNA expression , in our conditions we detected up-regulation in the ileum and , surprisingly , a high down-regulation in the jejunum that has not been previously reported ( Tab . 
II ) . 
The biological signiﬁcance of these large differences in the expression of both defensins along the pig intestine is difﬁcult to establish . 
PBD-1 and PBD-2 seem to have a potent antimicrobial function but the differential regulation observed in our study might be related to a non-antimicrobial activity of defen-sins , such as chemotaxis of immature DC or memory T-cells [ 34 ] . 
Therefore , further experiments are required to elucidate the role of PBD-1 and PBD-2 in the intestinal response to S. typhimurium . 
In summary , using an oral S. typhimurium infection model , we identiﬁed genes differentially expressed in anatomical different parts of the porcine gut that should contribute to a better understanding of the porcine intestinal response to bacterial infection . 
Our results reveal that the jejunum , ileum and colon respond differently to infection with S. typhimu-rium , and showed ileum mucosa as unable to up-regulate some proinﬂammatory cytokines , which could help to a more successful colonization of this site by the infecting bacteria . 
In addition , differences in the pattern of gene expression among the three intestinal sections at the steady state have been established . 
We conclude that there are regional differences in the inﬂammatory response to S. typhimurium within the porcine gastrointestinal tract , and consequently , insight into the immunity mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the intes-tinal host defense development in this economically important species must be sought in this context .
