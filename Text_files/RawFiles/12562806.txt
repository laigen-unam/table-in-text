Salmonella , Escherichia , and Klebsiella do not encode any recognized type of N-acylhomoserine lactone ( AHL ) synthase , and consistent with this , they do not synthesize AHLs under any conditions tested . 
However , they do encode an AHL receptor of the LuxR family , named SdiA . 
MudJ fusions in four loci are known to respond to plasmid-encoded sdiA in Salmonella , but only the rck locus has been described . 
Here we report the location and sequence analysis of the remaining three loci . 
The srg-6 : : MudJ is within gtgA of the gifsy-2 prophage , and the srg-7 : : MudJ is within PSLT61 of the virulence plasmid . 
Both fusions are in the antisense orientation . 
The third fusion , srgE5 : : MudJ , is within a horizontally acquired gene of unknown function at 33.6 centisomes that we have named srgE . 
Previously , sdiA expressed from its natural position in the chromosome was demonstrated to activate a plasmid-based transcriptional fusion to the rck promoter in response to AHL production by other bacterial species . 
However , the MudJ fusions did not respond to chromosomal sdiA . 
Here we report that MudJ fusions to three of the four loci ( not srg-6 ) are activated by AHL in an sdiA-dependent manner during growth in motility agar ( 0.25 % agar ) but not during growth in top agar ( 0.7 % agar ) or on agar plates ( 1.2 % agar ) . 
In motility agar , the srgE promoter responds to sdiA at 30 °C and higher while the rck and srg-7 promoters respond only at 37 or 42 °C . 
Substantial AHL-independent SdiA activity was observed at 30 °C but not at 37 °C . 
Many species of bacteria use cell-to-cell signaling as an input for gene regulation ( 10 , 24 ) . 
Small signal molecules are released into the environment and can be detected by bacterial sensory systems . 
In the gram-negative bacteria , the most commonly studied signals are N-acylhomoserine lactones ( AHLs ) , with the corresponding sensor being a LuxR homolog ( 36 ) . 
The LuxR homologs have an N-terminal domain for binding AHL and a C-terminal helix-tum-helix domain for binding DNA ( 33 , 44 ) . 
In most cases it is hypothesized that the bacteria use the concentration of signal molecules as an indicator of the population density of their own species , a phenomenon known as quorum sensing ( 24 ) . 
Many bacteria regulate secondary metabolism and/or host interaction genes in response to this information ( 24 ) . 
The ﬁnal step in AHL synthesis is catalyzed by enzymes of the LuxI family ( 13 , 39 ) . 
Each LuxI family member typically generates a single AHL , along with smaller amounts of related molecules . 
The primary difference between the AHLs synthesized by different LuxI enzymes is the length of the acyl chain , which usually varies between 4 and 14 carbons . 
AHLs can also vary at the 3-carbon position by the presence of a carbonyl or hydroxyl group . 
The AHLs discussed in this report are abbreviated C6 , C8 , etc. to denote chain length , and oxoC6 , oxoC8 , etc. to denote a carbonyl modiﬁcation . 
Many bacteria encode more than one LuxI-type enzyme and synthesize several AHLs . 
The AHL production and response proﬁle of different species can overlap , providing the potential for cross talk between species ( 27 , 30 , 31 , 40 ) . 
The genera Escherichia , Salmonella , and Klebsiella provide

an unusual case . 
The existing DNA sequence databases for these organisms show that each species carries a single luxR homolog named sdiA but does not carry a luxI family member . 
Other types of AHL synthase enzymes have been identiﬁed in Vibrio and Pseudomonas ( luxLM and hdtS [ 5 , 14 , 20 ] ) , but Escherichia , Salmonella , and Klebsiella do not encode homologs of these enzymes either . 
Consistent with the genome sequence data , representatives of these genera fail to produce detectable levels of AHLs in standard bioassays under laboratory growth conditions ( 22 , 36 ) . 
Since these organisms contain an AHL receptor but do not synthesize AHLs , they can not be using SdiA to determine the population density of their own species . 
Instead , they may use SdiA to detect AHLs produced by other microbial species ( 22 ) . 
Before the signals for SdiA had been identiﬁed plasmidbased expression of sdiA was used to identify responsive transcriptional fusions in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( 1 ) . 
The fusions were created with the MudJ transposable element , which creates lacZY fusions on insertion into a coding sequence ( 8 , 17 ) . 
Seven fusions were isolated in the rck operon ( for `` resistance to complement killing '' ) on the serovar Typhi-murium virulence plasmid . 
Three additional fusions were obtained , but the DNA sequence ﬂanking the MudJ insertions did not match the existing database entries . 
Here we report the locations of these three fusions now that the serovar Typhi-murium genome sequence has been completed . 
These 10 fusions were isolated based on their response to plasmid-based expression of sdiA , but they failed to show any sdiA-dependent expression when placed into isogenic wild-type and sdiA mutant backgrounds ( 1 ) . 
It was hypothesized that there were no AHLs in the culture and that overexpression of sdiA had bypassed the AHL requirement ( 1 ) . 
Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained when a plasmid-based luciferase fusion to the rck operon promoter was found to be activated in an sdiA-dependent manner in response to synthetic oxoC6 and oxoC at concentrations of 1 to 10 nM . 
The fusion also re-8 sponded to C and C when the concentrations were approxi-6 8 mately 10-fold higher ( 22 ) . 
However , responses to AHL were not observed when the chromosomal MudJ fusions were used ( we refer to all of the MudJ fusions , including those on the virulence plasmid , as chromosomal to distinguish them from the multicopy plasmid-based luciferase fusions [ 22 ] ) . 
The MudJ fusions failed to respond in cross-streak assays on 1.5 % agar plates , in ﬁlter disk assays performed with 0.7 % top agar , and in early-exponential-phase liquid cultures ( 22 ) . 
In this report , we show that growth in motility agar or to the late exponential phase in liquid culture allows the sdiA-dependent activation of chromosomal fusions in response to AHL or to bacterial species producing AHL . 
This is a deﬁnitive demonstration that SdiA detects and responds to AHL production by other bacterial species . 
We also reveal the locations of three previously uncharacterized MudJ fusions that are regulated by SdiA .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and media . 
Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( EM Science ) . 
Agar was added to 0.25 % ( motility agar ) , 0.7 % ( top agar ) , or 1.2 % ( agar plates ) as indicated . 
Tetracycline and kanamycin were used at 20 and 60 g/ml , respectively , when appropriate . 
5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galac-topyranoside ( X-Gal ) was used at a ﬁnal concentration of 40 g/ml . 
C6 ( Sigma ) and oxoC8 ( 22 ) were dissolved in acidiﬁed ethyl acetate ( EA ) ( 28 ) and used at ﬁnal concentrations of 10 nM and 1 M , respectively . 
EA was used as a solvent control at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 % . 
The strains and plasmids used are described in Table 1 . 
Plasmid constructions . 
To isolate the promoter of srgE , a plasmid-based transcriptional fusion was constructed ( see Fig. 1 ) . 
The putative promoter region was ampliﬁed from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) . 
Each primer contained a BglII restriction site at the 5 end . 
The PCR product spans nucleotides 16638 to 17114 of Genbank accession number AE008767 . 
The resulting PCR product was cloned using pCR-Blunt II Topo ( Invitrogen ) . 
The insert was removed from pCR-Blunt II Topo by using EcoRI and cloned into pSB401 from which the luxR-containing EcoRI fragment had been removed . 
Clones were screened for insert and orientation using PCR . 
One isolate forming a srgE-luxCDABE fusion was named pJNS25 , while a clone in the opposite orientation was named pJNS35 . 
These plasmids were electroporated into strains 14028 and BA612 using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II . 
Measurement of luciferase and - galactosidase activity . 
Liquid cultures were grown in 5-ml volumes in 18 - by 150-mm tubes placed near horizontal in a drum roller to maintain agitation . 
The optical density ( OD ) of the cultures was measured with a Spectronic 20D instrument at 550 nm . 
The light production of 10 - l samples was integrated for 10 s with a Turner Designs TD-20 / 20 luminom-eter and expressed as Light/OD . 
Expression of luciferase by bacteria on plates or in motility agar was imaged and quantitated using a C2400-32 intensiﬁed chargecoupled device camera with an Argus 20 image processor ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) ( 9 ) . 
Expression of lacZY reporters was measured using - galactosidase assays as described by Miller with the following modiﬁcations ( 23 ) . 
The liquid cultures were grown as described above for luciferase assays , except that at each time point a 300 - l sample was taken and placed on ice until all samples had been collected . 
A 20 - l portion of each sample was placed into a polystyrene ﬂat bottom 96-well plate containing 180 l of LB for reading of the OD at 570 nm with a Dynatech Instruments MR700 plate reader . 
The readings using this instrument were multiplied by 3.47 to account for path length differences between the MR700 and the Spectronic 20D used for the luciferase assays . 
A 100 - l volume of sample was placed into a polypropylene round-bottom 96-well plate containing 100 l of Z-buffer and solubilized with 4 l of chloroform and 4 l of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate . 
A 40 - l volume of 4-mg/ml o-nitrophenyl -- D-galactopyranoside ( ONPG ) was added to start the reaction , and 100 l of 1M NaCO3 was added to stop it . 
The plate was then centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min to pellet the chloroform and bacteria . 
Supernatant ( 100 l ) was transferred to a polystyrene ﬂat-bottom 96-well plate for determination of A410 with the Dynatech MR700 plate reader . 
Units of activity were calculated as ( 1,000 A410 ) / [ reaction time ( minutes ) sample volume ( milliliters ) OD ] . 
570 Comparisons of lacZY fusions in motility agar were qualitative , with each strain being stabbed , via a pipette tip , into agar containing 40 g of X-Gal per ml . 
This was followed by an overnight incubation , during which the bacteria spread across the plate . 
However , in some experiments the agar concentration was increased to a point at which the bacteria could no longer swim through it . 
For those experiments , the plates were seeded with bacteria when the plates were poured . 
Each reporter strain ( 100 l of an overnight culture ) was added to 25 ml of molten LB agar ( cooled to 50 °C ) containing X-Gal and AHL , poured into a petri plate , allowed to solidify at room temperature , and then incubated over-night at 37 °C .

RESULTS
Locations of sdiA-regulated MudJ insertions . 
Previously we identiﬁed 10 MudJ fusions that respond to plasmid-encoded sdiA ( 1 ) . 
Inverse PCR was performed to obtain small fragments of DNA ﬂanking the MudJ insertion sites , and DNA sequencing revealed that seven of the fusions are located within the rck operon while three are in uncharacterized genes at unknown map locations ( 1 , 22 ) . 
For this study , we determined their locations by comparing the ﬂanking DNA sequence of the fusions to that of the recently completed S. enterica serovar Typhimurium genome ( 21 ) . 
Of the three MudJ fusions located outside the rck operon , the ﬁrst is srg-5 : : MudJ ( Fig. 1A ) . 
According to the nomenclature of the recently completed serovar Typhimurium genome ( 21 ) , this insertion is within an open reading frame ( ORF ) named STM1554 at 33.6 centisomes ( between nucleotides 15335 and 15336 of accession number AE008767 ) . 
The insertion is at the extreme 3 end of the gene so that only the last 5 codons are disrupted and the lacZ fusion is in the sense orientation . 
Because this gene is strongly regulated by sdiA and because the promoter region has been isolated and conﬁrmed to be sdiA dependent ( see below ) , we propose the name srgE for STM1554 ( for `` sdiA-regulated gene E '' ) and the allele number srgE5 : : MudJ for the insertion . 
srgE appears to be within a 39-kb `` island '' because eight ORFs upstream of srgE ( STM1555 to STM1562 ) and 26 ORFs downstream of srgE ( STM1553 to STM1528 ) are predominantly Salmonella spe-ciﬁc . 
The boundaries of the island are the osmC gene in the clockwise direction and the yne genes in the counterclockwise direction . 
However , the G C content varies widely among the ORFs , suggesting that the island is a mosaic of acquisition and/or deletion events . 
The organization of the region suggests that srgE is expressed from a monocistronic transcript . 
Three ORFs are divergently transcribed from the srgE promoter region ( STM1555 to STM1557 ) , but these are not regulated by sdiA ( see below ) . 
The G C content of Salmonella is typically 53 % , while the G C content of srgE is much lower at 36 % ( 21 ) . 
The G C content abruptly increases on both sides of srgE , suggesting that srgE may have been a single-gene acquisition . 
The molecular mass of SrgE is predicted to be 55.7 kDa , with a pI of 6.8 . 
The annotation of the serovar Typhimurium genome predicts that SrgE is an inner membrane protein based on identiﬁcation of a transmembrane domain between residues 418 and 435 , using the program PSORT ( 25 ) . 
However , another transmembrane helix prediction program , TMHMM 2.0 , suggests that there are no transmembrane helices ( 19 ) , leaving the predicted subcellular localization of SrgE uncertain . 
The genome annotation suggests that SrgE has a coiled-coil domain ( 21 ) . 
The PairCoil program also suggests that SrgE has coiled-coil domain , located between residues 344 and 374 ( 6 ) . 
The function and signiﬁcance of this domain are unknown . 
The only similar protein in the current databases , using BLAST programs , is an apparent ortholog of srgE in the S. enterica serovar Typhi genome , ORF STY1509 ( 3 , 4 , 26 ) . 
STY1509 is 98 % identical to SrgE throughout the majority of the protein . 
However , STY1509 lacks 15 N-terminal residues ( possibly due to a start codon prediction discrepancy ) and 82 C-terminal residues compared to SrgE . 
The PairCoil program predicts a coiled-coil domain in the serovar Typhi protein between resi-dues 329 and 359 . 
The second fusion , srg-6 : : MudJ , is located within STM1026 ( gtgA ) in the antisense orientation ( nucleotide 29215 of accession number AE008743 ) . 
This gene lies within the gifsy-2 pro-phage at 24 centisomes ( 12 ) . 
GtgA has 97 % amino acid identity to GogA of the gifsy-1 phage and 71 % identity to PipA of SPI5 ( 12 , 41 ) . 
The function of this gene and the signiﬁcance of the antisense regulation by sdiA are unknown . 
The third fusion , srg-7 : : MudJ , resides on the virulence plasmid of serovar Typhimurium . 
The fusion is in the antisense orientation within ORF PSLT61 ( nucleotide 50951 of accession number AE006471 ) ( 21 ) . 
PSLT61 has a high G C content ( 61 % ) and is predicted to encode an inner membrane protein of 28.5 kDa with a pI of 5.2 . 
This protein is at least 38 % identical to the products of numerous plasmid-located genes of unknown function including ycfA from plasmid ColIb-P9 , protein L7076 from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli plasmid pO157 , and ORF248 of the E. coli F plasmid . 
As with srg-6 , the function of this gene and the signiﬁcance of the antisense regulation by sdiA are unknown . 
Cloning of the srgE promoter region . 
The intergenic region between srgE and the divergently transcribed gene was ampli-ﬁed by PCR and cloned into pSB401 to place the putative promoter region upstream of the promoterless luxCDABE operon . 
A clone with the srgE promoter in the appropriate orientation was named pJNS25 , while a clone with the fragment in the opposite orientation was named pJNS35 . 
These two reporter constructs were electroporated into the wild-type and sdiA mutant serovar Typhimurium strains 14028 and BA612 , respectively . 
Cross-streak assays were performed with these strains to detect sdiA-dependent responses to AHL . 
A 20 - l volume of 10 M C6 was streaked across one end of an LB plate , and the reporter strains were streaked perpendicular to the AHL . 
Increases in light production of at least 12-fold were observed from the wild-type strain carrying pJNS25 near the C6 , while the sdiA mutant strain did not respond ( Fig. 1B ) . 
This conﬁrms that the region cloned within pJNS25 does contain an sdiA-dependent promoter . 
The strains carrying pJNS35 did not respond to AHL ( data not shown ) , demonstrating that the sdiA-dependent activation of the srgE promoter is unidirectional . 
Similar attempts to clone the srg-6 and srg-7 promoters were unsuccessful . 
Conditions that allow chromosomal fusions to respond to SdiA and AHL . 
Previously we determined that SdiA expressed from the chromosome could activate a plasmid-based PrckluxCDABE reporter in the presence of particular AHLs ( 22 ) . 
This activation occurred under a variety of conditions including cross-streak assays on solid LB agar plates ( 1.2 or 1.5 % agar ) , ﬁlter disk assays in 0.7 % top agar , and liquid culture . 
However , the MudJ insertions in the rck operon and the other three srg loci did not respond to chromosomally encoded SdiA and AHL ( they responded only to plasmid-encoded SdiA ) . 
Since this observation cast doubt on the ability of SdiA to truly detect and respond to AHL production by other species , our recent focus has been on identifying growth conditions that allow the activation of chromosomal fusions by chromosomal sdiA . 
It was recently discovered that the regulator adjacent to sdiA , named sirA , is much more active during growth in mo-tility agar ( LB broth containing 0.25 % agar ) than in liquid culture ( 15 ) . 
Therefore , we tested the ability of SdiA to activate chromosomal fusions in motility agar . 
All plates contained either 1 M C6 or 0.1 % acidiﬁed EA as a solvent control . 
MudJ fusions to all four sdiA-regulated loci were tested in each type of medium at four different incubation temperatures . 
While this is a qualitative assay , the results clearly demonstrated that three of the four loci can be activated under particular growth conditions . 
srgA1 : : MudJ ( representing the rck operon ) , srgE5 : : MudJ , and srg-7 : : MudJ responded to AHL in an sdiA-dependent manner , while srg-6 : : MudJ was not regulated by sdiA under any condition ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Activation of the three fusions was primarily sdiA and AHL dependent , although both sdiA - and AHL-independent expression was observed . 
Expression of the srgE5 : : MudJ fusion was observed at 30 , 37 , and 42 °C but not at 22 °C . 
At each temperature the expression was completely sdiA dependent . 
Consistent with the sdiA dependence , the expression at 37 °C was almost entirely AHL dependent . 
However , at 30 °C , sdiA-dependent activation was observed in the absence of AHL . 
The srgA1 : : MudJ fusion differs from the srgE5 : : MudJ in two respects . 
First , the rck operon is more tightly temperature dependent in that expression was observed only at 37 and 42 °C . 
Second , the rck operon can be expressed in the absence of sdiA under certain conditions . 
For example , in Fig. 2 the sdiA mutant shows an increase in srgA1 : : MudJ expression at 37 and 42 °C compared to 22 and 30 °C . 
The regulation of srg-7 : : MudJ by sdiA was very weak , but it had an expression pattern similar to that of srgA1 : : MudJ ( Fig. 2 ) . 
This is interesting given that both fusions are present on the serovar Typhimurium virulence plasmid . 
Like srgA1 , the srg-7 fusion was not expressed at 22 °C or 30 °C . 
Also like srgA1 , there was expression in the absence of sdiA and AHL at higher temperatures . 
The assays throughout this report used C6 at a concentration of 1 M. SdiA detects oxoC8 at much lower concentrations than C6 , but oxoC8 is not commercially available and is not easy to synthesize . 
To determine if the use of oxoC8 would give different results from the use of C6 , the motility agar assays in this section were performed once with oxoC8 at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 nM . 
The results were essentially identical to those obtained using 1 M C6 ( data not shown ) . 
Agar percentages that allow sdiA-dependent activation of chromosomal fusions . 
To examine the effect of agar concentration more closely , we seeded plates of various agar concentrations with each reporter strain and 1 M C6 and incubated them overnight at 37 °C . 
SdiA-dependent activation of srgE was observed with 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 % agar but not with 0.7 % agar ( data not shown ) . 
The response in 0.6 % agar was very weak . 
The srgA1 : : MudJ and srg-7 : : MudJ fusions were both activated in an sdiA-dependent manner in 0.3 and 0.4 % agar . 
Interest ingly , both fusions were more active using 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.7 % agar , but this was not an sdiA-dependent activation , and in fact the presence of sdiA seemed to inhibit the increased response ( the sdiA mutant was slightly darker blue than was the wild type [ data not shown ] ) . 
The srg-6 : : MudJ fusion did not respond to AHL under any conditions . 
To summarize , all of the chromosomal MudJ fusions except srg-6 respond to AHL in an sdiA-dependent manner when the bacteria are grown in 0.25 to 0.4 % motility agar but not in 0.7 % top agar or on 1.2 % agar plates . 
Quantitation of sdiA-dependent responses in liquid media . 
Attempts to measure - galactosidase activity in motility agar were unsuccessful . 
Therefore , we evaluated the response of the chromosomal and plasmid-based fusions in liquid culture . 
Mild responses were observed for chromosomal fusions at late-ex-ponential and stationary phases ( maximum of 4.4-fold for srgE5 : : MudJ at 37 °C [ Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ] ) . 
These responses allowed us to quantitate and compare the levels of AHL-depen-dent and AHL-independent SdiA activity . 
The pattern of response in liquid culture was similar to that obtained in motility agar in that srgE5 : : MudJ was the strongest responder ( with regard to fold differences ) , followed by srgA1 : : MudJ and srg-7 : : MudJ ( Fig. 3 and Table 2 for srgE5 and srgA1 ; data not shown for srg-7 ) . 
srg-6 : : MudJ failed to respond ( data not shown ) . 
One difference between liquid and motility agar is that the rck operon was activated weakly in liquid at 30 °C ( 2.4-fold ) while no expression was detected in motility agar at the same temperature . 
Another difference is that the AHL-independent SdiA activity observed at 30 °C was much stronger in motility agar than in liquid ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ) . 
Overall , fold induction values in the presence of AHL increased as the temperature was increased from 30 to 37 °C ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ) . 
However , as the temperature was reduced from 37 to 30 °C , SdiA became active in the absence of AHL ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ) . 
SdiA can activate chromosomal fusions in response to other species of bacteria . 
A plasmid-based Prck-luxCDABE fusion was previously demonstrated to respond in an sdiA-dependent fashion to the presence of other bacterial species in a cross-streak assay on a standard 1.5 % agar LB plate ( 22 ) . 
Two species that were potent activators of SdiA in this assay are Yersinia enterocolitica and Hafnia alvei ( 22 ) . 
However , the chromosomal MudJ fusions to sdiA-regulated loci did not respond in this assay ( 22 ) , which cast doubt on the ability of SdiA to detect and respond to other species . 
To determine if the MudJ fusions would respond to Y. enterocolitica or H. alvei in motility agar , we stabbed one side of a motility agar plate with an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium reporter strain and the other side with Y. enterocolitica or H. alvei . 
The best results were obtained when the Yersinia and Hafnia strains were given a 1-day head start at either 22 or 30 °C , respectively , before the Salmonella was added to the plate . 
Once the Salmonella was stabbed into the plates , the plates were incubated for a further 24 h at 37 °C . 
During this time , the serovar Typhimurium cells swam outward and surrounded the Y. enterocolitica or H. alvei cells . 
As shown in Fig. 4 , the chromosomal MudJ fusions were activated in an sdiA-dependent manner in the region immediately surrounding the AHL-producing species . 
The fusions did not respond to a yenI mutant of Y. enterocolitica that can not synthesize AHLs ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The sdiA-dependent response of the serovar Typhimurium chromosomal MudJ fusions in this assay conclusively demonstrates that Salmonella can detect and respond to other bacterial species that are synthesizing AHLs . 
SdiA-dependent expression in the absence of exogenously added AHL is not due to AHL production by Salmonella . 
We have previously reported that the three genera known to encode SdiA ( Escherichia , Klebsiella , and Salmonella ) do not synthesize AHLs at concentrations that can be detected by bio-sensors ( 22 ) . 
However , those studies were performed at 37 °C . 
The studies performed at 30 °C in this report show SdiA activity in the absence of exogenously supplied AHL . 
It was possible that sufﬁcient concentrations of AHL are generated by Salmo-nella at 30 °C to partially activate SdiA . 
To test this hypothesis , we grew two Salmonella strains at 30 °C in LB motility agar containing X-Gal , adjacent to four different AHL biosensor strains ( Fig. 5 ) .

a Data from Fig. 3 . 
BA1101 ( 14028 srgE5 : : MudJ ) and the isogenic sdiA mutant , BA1301 , were used to demonstrate that there was indeed AHL-independent SdiA activity during the assay ( BA1101 was light blue , while BA1301 was white ) . 
The four reporters were CviR , LasR , LuxR , and AhyR . 
The CviR reporter strain was Chromobacterium violaceum strain CVOblu , while the other three reporters are E. coli based : DH5 / pSB536 ( AhyR ) , JM109/pSB401 ( LuxR ) , and JM109/pSB1075 ( LasR ) . 
CVOblu synthesizes the purple pigment violacein when short-chain AHLs are detected ( C4 and C6 [ 34 ] ) . 
The pSB536 reporter encodes AhyR from Aeromonas hydrophila , which responds to C4 ( 34 , 35 ) . 
The pSB401 plasmid encodes LuxR from Vibrio ﬁscheri , which detects oxoC with highest sensitivity but also 6 detects oxoC , C , and C , the same AHLs detected by SdiA 8 6 8 ( 40 ) . 
Plasmid pSB1075 encodes the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR protein , which detects oxoC12 with highest sensitivity but also detects C10 , C12 , oxoC10 , and oxoC ( 40 ) . 
We also at-14 tempted to use the TraR reporter Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain NT1/pDCI41E33 ( 31 ) , but it failed to detect positive control strains under the conditions used , and so it was not used . 
The CviR reporter was able to detect the positive control species Serratia marcescens and Hafnia alvei but showed absolutely no response to the Salmonella strains ( Fig. 5A ) . 
The lux-based reporters all showed a basal level of light in the presence of Salmonella but responded strongly to control strains ( Fig. 5B ) . 
To be sure that the low levels of light emitted in the presence of Salmonella are indeed basal levels of reporter expression , indicative of no signal , negative control strains were used . 
For the LuxR reporter , the positive control species was Y. enterocolitica and the negative control was an isogenic yenI mutant which can not synthesize AHLs . 
For the AhyR and LasR reporters , the positive control species was P. aeruginosa and the negative control was an isogenic lasI rhlI double mutant of P. aeruginosa that can not synthesize AHLs . 
The response of these three reporter systems to Salmonella was less than or equal to the response generated by the negative control strains . 
Given that all of these reporters can detect AHLs at nanomolar concentrations , similar to SdiA ( 1 to 10 nM for SdiA [ 22 ] , 1 nM for CviR [ 7 ] , 1 to 10 nM for LuxR [ 40 ] , and 0.1 to 1 nM for LasR [ 40 ] ) , we conclude that Salmonella is not producing AHL at the nanomolar concentrations required to activate SdiA . 
Because low levels of SdiA activity were observed during the assay ( BA1101 was light blue , while BA1301 was white ) , we conclude that this is a basal level of SdiA activity that does not represent AHL detection . 
FIG. 4 . 
Chromosomal MudJ fusions respond to AHL-producing bacterial species in an sdiA-dependent manner . 
All plates contain LB motility agar and X-Gal . 
Either H. alvei , Y. enterocolitica , or an isogenic yenI mutant of Y. enterocolitica was stabbed into the right side of each plate as indicated . 
Wild-type Salmonella containing the srgE5 : : MudJ insertion ( BA1101 ) was stabbed into the left side of each plate in the left column . 
The isogenic sdiA mutant ( BA1301 ) was stabbed into the left side of each plate in the right column . 
The Yersinia strains were stabbed and incubated at room temperature for 24 h before the Sal-monella strains were stabbed . 
The Hafnia was stabbed and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h before the Salmonella strains were stabbed . 
After the Salmonella strains had been stabbed , the plates were incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C . 
The Salmonella cells are more motile than the H. alvei cells and much more motile than the Y. enterocolitica cells under these conditions , resulting in the Salmonella cells completely surrounding the Y. enterocolitica cells . 
A blue halo indicating activation of srgE5 : : MudJ is seen near the AHL-producing strains H. alvei and Y. enterocolitica but not near the yenI mutant . 
The activation does not occur in the sdiA mutant . 
Salmonella carrying the srgA1 : : MudJ also responds in this assay ( data not shown ) .

Expression of the rck and srgE promoters measured with chromosomal MudJ fusions and plasmid-based luxCDABE fusions in liquid LB medium at 30 and 37 °C . 
An sdiA-dependent response to AHL can be seen under all conditions with both promoters . 
However , AHL-independent SdiA activity is present at 30 °C and to a lesser extent at 37 °C . 
A key for each pair of graphs is located between the graphs . 
Expression is indicated by bars , with units indicated on the left y axis ( the units are Miller units of - galactosidase for the MudJ fusions and Light/OD for the luxCDABE fusions ) . 
The growth curves of the cultures are superimposed with units indicated on the right y axis ( the units are OD570 for the MudJ fusions and OD550 for the luxCDABE fusions ) 
FIG. 5 . 
Activity of SdiA in the absence of exogenously supplied AHL is not the result of AHL production by Salmonella . 
In LB motility agar containing X-Gal at 30 °C , the Salmonella strain BA1101 ( 14028 srgE5 : : MudJ ) is a darker blue than the isogenic sdiA mutant BA1301 . 
To determine if Salmonella is synthesizing AHLs under these conditions , four different AHL reporter strains were inoculated adjacent to BA1101 and BA1301 . 
All strains ( reporters and positive and negative controls ) were stabbed and incubated at room temperature for 24 h before the Salmonella strains were stabbed into the plates , at which point the plates were incubated at 37 °C . 
( A ) The CviR reporter ( CVOblu ) fails to detect AHL production by Salmonella , although it responds strongly to the positive control species H. alvei and S. marc-escens under these conditions ( indicated by purple pigment production ) . 
( B ) The LuxR reporter ( JM109/pSB401 ) shows only basal levels of light production in response to Salmonella strains BA1101 and BA1301 and the Y. enterocolitica yenI mutant , although it responds strongly to the positive control species Y. enterocolitica ( luminescence from four plates is shown ) . 
The LasR and AhyR reporters also fail to detect AHL production from Salmonella although they respond strongly to positive control species ( data not shown ) . 
DISCUSSION
Quorum sensing in gram-negative bacteria typically utilizes a LuxI homolog to generate a signal molecule and a LuxR homolog to detect it . 
In Salmonella , Escherichia , and Klebsiella , there is no LuxI homolog ; consistent with this , biosensors fail to detect AHL production by these organisms ( 22 , 36 ; this report ) . 
However , these genera do encode a LuxR homolog named SdiA . 
In this study we determined the locations of three previously uncharacterized MudJ fusions that respond to plas-mid-encoded sdiA and demonstrated conclusively that Salmo-nella uses SdiA to detect AHL production by other species of bacteria . 
We have demonstrated that chromosomal MudJ fusions to srgE , srg-7 , and the rck operon respond to exogenous AHL in an sdiA-dependent fashion when sdiA is expressed from its natural position in the chromosome . 
This is the ﬁrst study in which chromosomal fusions have been activated by chromosomal sdiA . 
The chromosomal fusions respond in both liquid medium and in motility agar ( 0.25 % ) but do not respond in top agar ( 0.7 % agar ) or on solid agar plates ( 1.2 or 1.5 % agar ) . 
The plasmid-based reporter systems for srgE and rck are not limited in this way and respond to SdiA and AHL under all these conditions . 
Therefore , the chromosomal fusions are the more relevant reporters , although as a simple AHL detection system the plasmid-based fusions are more useful since they can be used in a ﬁlter disk assay or in a cross-streak assay . 
There is a regulator downstream of sdiA that has requirements that seem inverted compared to sdiA . 
The regulator is named sirA in Salmonella , and it regulates motility and invasion functions ( 2 , 15 , 18 ) . 
SirA is active on solid agar and in motility agar but is only weakly active in liquid ( 15 ) . 
Therefore , motility agar containing AHL is currently the in vitro medium of choice to ensure that both regulators are active . 
The signiﬁcance of two of the srg loci with regard to the SdiA regulon is questionable at this point . 
The MudJ insertions for both are in the antisense orientation . 
One of these , srg-7 , can be activated slightly by chromosomal sdiA in response to exogenous AHL . 
The srg-7 : : MudJ fusion is located within PSLT61 on the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence plasmid which does not have a known function . 
There are homologs of PSLT61 on many plasmids including the F plasmid of E. coli and pO157 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli . 
The second antisense fusion is srg-6 : : MudJ . 
This fusion resides within the gtgA gene of the gifsy-2 prophage . 
The function of this gene is not known . 
This fusion is the weakest in response to plasmidlocated sdiA ( 1 ) and is the only fusion for which we have not yet detected a response to chromosomal sdiA and exogenous AHL . 
Our preliminary attempts to isolate the sdiA-dependent promoters for both srg-6 and srg-7 were unsuccessful . 
In contrast , the srg-5 : : MudJ is in the sense orientation within ORF STM1554 and is strongly activated by sdiA . 
The promoter region for this gene was successfully isolated and conﬁrmed to be sdiA dependent ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Therefore , we propose the name srgE ( for `` sdiA-regulated gene '' ) for ORF STM1554 and the allele name srgE5 : : MudJ for the insertion . 
In addition , we propose a name change within the rck operon . 
We recently reported that the sdiA-dependent promoter of the rck operon was further upstream than expected ( 22 ) . 
This added two genes to the operon , pef1 and ORF7 ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Because other genes within this operon are named srgA , srgB , and srgC , we propose that ORF7 be named srgD . 
The rck operon and srg-7 are carried on the serovar Typhi-murium virulence plasmid and share several traits that differ from srgE . 
Fusions to both the rck operon and srg-7 are tightl temperature dependent in motility agar in that they fail to respond to AHL at 30 °C and instead respond only at 37 °C and higher . 
In contrast , the srgE promoter responds strongly to AHL at 30 °C and higher . 
However , this difference between the rck operon and srgE largely disappears in liquid culture , where both loci can be activated at 30 °C . 
None of the fusions are active at room temperature , and the mechanism of tempera-ture-dependence is unknown . 
However , the 37 °C optimal temperature for the SdiA regulon suggests that the mammalian gastrointestinal tract may be the location where SdiA detects and responds to AHL . 
Consistent with this hypothesis is the recent detection in the bovine rumen of compounds that can activate AHL biosensors ( 11 ) . 
A second trait shared by the rck operon and srg-7 is that both can be expressed in the absence of sdiA , a characteristic that complicates studies of sdiA . 
Under the conditions examined to date , the srgE promoter is not expressed in the absence of sdiA and therefore provides the simplest and strongest reporter of SdiA activity . 
The srgE promoter is the third sdiA-dependent promoter to be isolated . 
The other two promoters are the rck operon promoter in Salmonella and the ftsQ promoter in E. coli . 
The promoter for the rck operon resides between ORF6 and pef1 ( 22 ) and is shown in Fig. 1A . 
In E. coli , the ftsQP2 promoter cloned on a multicopy plasmid as a fusion to lacZY is activated 5 - to 13-fold in response to plasmid-encoded sdiA but only 1.3-fold in response to chromosomal sdiA ( 38 ) . 
Addition of AHL to the culture increases expression by twofold but only when using plasmid-encoded sdiA ( 32 ) . 
Therefore , unlike the and promoters , the promoter has never rck srgE E. coli ftsQP2 been shown to respond to AHL using sdiA expressed from its natural position in the chromosome , and our preliminary results indicate that it does not ( unpublished data ) . 
However , biochemical experiments using puriﬁed SdiA and the ftsQP2 promoter ( in the absence of AHL ) revealed a putative SdiA binding site ( 42 ) . 
This sequence is not present within the promoter regions of either srgE or the rck operon , suggesting that this is either not a speciﬁc SdiA binding site or SdiA of E. coli has a different binding site than SdiA of Salmonella or that rck and srgE are only indirectly affected by SdiA . 
We feel that prediction of SdiA binding sites is premature at this point and should await the results of biochemical experiments with more promoters . 
To date , SdiA is the only LuxR homolog that is hypothesized to detect only the AHL production of other species . 
For this to be true , it must be clear that Salmonella fails to synthesize AHLs and that SdiA is active only when AHLs are supplied exogenously . 
This has been demonstrated conclusively in this study at 37 °C . 
In liquid culture we observed a 1.3-fold difference between the wild type and the sdiA mutant when measuring the regulation of the srgA1 : : MudJ and srgE5 : : MudJ fusions ( Table 2 ) . 
However , there is no detectable AHL production by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium at this temperature ( 22 ) , so we ascribe this 1.3-fold difference to basal levels of SdiA activity . 
Furthermore , as shown in Fig. 4 , Salmonella can detect and respond to the presence of H. alvei or Y. enterocolitica . 
This detection event requires that Salmonella carry sdiA and that the other species produce AHL ( the yenI mutant of Yersinia is not detected ) . 
We feel that this combination of evidence conclusively demonstrates that at 37 °C Salmonella fails to synthesize AHLs but detects and responds to AHLs produced by other species . 
The conclusions to be drawn from results obtained at 30 °C are not so clear . 
At this temperature there is substantial SdiA activity in the absence of AHL ( Fig. 2 and 3 ; Table 2 ) . 
This activity is strongest in motility agar , where the expression of srgE in the presence and absence of AHL is nearly identical but still entirely sdiA dependent ( this is seen only with srgE , since the other fusions are not expressed at 30 °C [ Fig. 2 ] ) . 
In liquid culture , the AHL-independent SdiA activity is less intense but is seen with both srgE and the rck operon ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ) . 
Since Salmonella is not producing AHL at this temperature ( Fig. 5 ) , there are two potential explanations for this activity . 
First , SdiA may be detecting some type of molecule synthesized by Salmonella at 30 °C that is not an AHL . 
While we can not eliminate this possibility , we feel that it is unlikely because the molecule would have to be detected by SdiA but not by the other four LuxR-type biosensors , it would have to be produced only at 30 °C , and it would have to be produced by a currently unrecognized type of synthase . 
We favor the second possibility , in which the activity does not represent signal detection at all but simply represents high basal levels of SdiA activity in the absence of signal . 
This immediately raises the question of why the basal level of activity is so much higher at 30 °C than at 37 °C . 
We hypothesize that this could be due to either increased sdiA expression or increased oligomerization of SdiA at 30 °C . 
Both hypotheses need to be tested , but we already know that expression of sdiA from a plasmid increases the expression of SdiA-regulated genes in the absence of signal ( 1 , 22 ) . 
Regardless , this is the ﬁrst demonstration of chromosomally encoded sdiA activating chromosomal fusions . 
At 37 °C , this activation requires the addition of AHL from another source . 
We conclude that SdiA is used to detect AHLs that are synthesized by other species .
