Summary
Lipid A of Salmonella typhimurium is covalently modiﬁed with additional acyl and/or polar substituents in response to activation of the PhoP/PhoQ and/or PmrA / PmrB signalling systems , which are induced by growth at low Mg2 + concentrations and mild acid pH respectively . 
Although these conditions are thought to exist within macrophage phagolysosomes , no direct evidence for lipid A modiﬁcation after endocytosis has been presented . 
To address this issue , we grew S. typhimurium inside RAW264 .7 cells in the presence of 32Pi , and then isolated the labelled lipid A fraction , which was found to be extensively derivatized with phosphoethanolamine , aminoarabinose , 2-hydroxymyristate and/or palmitate moieties . 
S. typh-imurium grown in tissue culture medium synthesized lipid A molecules lacking all these substituents with the exception of the 2-hydroxymyristate chain , which was still present . 
Using deﬁned minimal media to simulate the intracellular pH and Mg2 + concentrations of endosomes , we found that lipid A of S. typhimurium grown in an acidic , low-Mg2 + medium closely resembled lipid A isolated from bacteria internalized by RAW264 .7 cells . 
A subset of S. typhimurium lipid A modiﬁcations were induced by low Mg2 + alone . 
Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 modiﬁed its lipid A mol-ecules in response to growth under acidic but not low-Mg2 + conditions . 
Growth in a high-Mg2 + , mildly alkaline medium resulted in suppression of most lipid A modiﬁcations with the exception of the 2-hydroxymyristate in S. typhimurium .

lipid A species containing 2-hydroxymyristate was independent of PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB in S. typhimurium . 
Our labelling methods should be applicable to studies of lipid A modiﬁcations induced by endocytosis of diverse bacteria . 
Introduction
Salmonella typhimurium causes a typhoid-like systemic infection of mice but only a self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans . 
Murine salmonellosis is characterized by dissemination of bacteria throughout the reticuloendothelial system with accumulation in liver and spleen ( Scherer and Miller , 2001 ) . 
Viable bacteria multiply inside resident mac-rophages of these tissues ( Richter-Dahlfors et al. , 1997 ) . 
The colonization of phagocytic cells is essential for murine salmonellosis . 
Mutant bacteria that can not survive within macrophages are avirulent ( Fields et al. , 1986 ) . 
Invasion of macrophages by S. typhimurium results in the activation of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component signalling system , which responds to the low divalent cation concentrations inside the phagolysososmal compartment ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) . 
Activation of PhoP leads to expression of at least 40 Salmonella Pag genes , many of which are required for survival within macrophages ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Miller et al. , 1989 ; Groisman , 2001 ) . 
Lipid A , the essential hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Raetz , 1996 ; Raetz and Whit-ﬁeld , 2002 ) , strongly stimulates innate immune responses . 
Macrophages from most animal species studied to date recognize the predominant hexa-acylated lipid A ( endotoxin ) of Escherichia coli or S. typhimurium as an agonist ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Exposure of mammalian macrophages to lipid A or LPS triggers the expression of macrophage genes encoding diverse cytokines and proteins , including TNF-a , IL1-b and tissue factor ( Beutler and Cerami , 1988 ; Dinarello , 1991 ; Janeway and Medzhitov , 2002 ) . 
Additional anti-microbial responses induced by LPS include the production of nitric oxide synthase and cationic anti-microbial peptides ( Janeway and Medzhitov , 2002 ) . 
The proﬁle of genes transcribed in infected RAW264 .7 cells is very similar to that seen in lipid A or LPS-stimulated cells ( Rosenberger et al. , 2000 ) . 
Miller and co-workers demonstrated that S. typhimu-rium alters the structure of its lipid A in response to growth 2 + under the low-Mg conditions thought to exist within mac-rophage phagolysosomes ( Guo et al. , 1997 ) and that

Lipid A species produced by S. typhimurium and E. coli in changing environments . 
In high-Mg2 + medium , S. typhimurium lipid A is largely unmodiﬁed , much like that of E. coli with the exception that the 2-hydroxylation is not suppressed ( A ) . 
In response to low-Mg2 + conditions ( B ) , several covalent modiﬁcations of lipid A are induced in S. typhimurium , including 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose ( L-Ara4N ) and palmitate addition ( Guo et al. , 1997 ; 1998 ; Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
Modiﬁcation of lipid A with phosphoethanolamine ( PEtN ) , which can be induced in wild-type E. coli or S. typhimurium at pH 6 ( B ) , is also observed in polymyxin-resistant PmrA-constitutive mutants of S. typhimurium or E. coli along with the L-Ara4N substit-uent ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2001 ) . 
Modiﬁcations labelled in red are associated with activation of PhoP/PhoQ , while those labelled in blue are stimulated mainly by activation of PmrA/PmrB . 
The 2-hydroxy-myristate modiﬁcation ( in magenta ) was present under all growth conditions in the present studies . 
PhoP/PhoQ plays a key role in regulating lipid A modiﬁcations . 
Activated PhoP secondarily activates the expression of the PmrA/PmrB system , another two-component signalling system that by itself is responsive to mildly acidic pH and/or Fe3 + , independently of the Mg2 + concentration ( Gunn and Miller , 1996 ; Wosten et al. , 2000 ) . 
Several of the genes regulated by PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA / PmrB encode enzymes that modify , respectively , either the acyl chain region or the phosphate groups of S. typh-imurium lipid A ( Fig. 1B ) . 
For instance , PagP is an outer membrane acyltransferase that adds a seventh acyl chain in acyloxyacyl linkage at the 2-position of the proximal unit 
( Bishop et al. , 2000 ) ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The positively charged sugar , 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose ( L-Ara4N ) , is added predominantly to the 4 cents - phosphate group of lipid A by the PmrA-regulated protein ArnT ( Helander et al. , 1994 ; Nummila et al. , 1995 ; Gunn et al. , 2000a ; Trent and Raetz , 2002 ) , while phosphoethanolamine ( PEtN ) is incorporated predominantly at the 1-phosphate position ( Helander et al. , 1994 ; Nummila et al. , 1995 ; Gunn et al. , 2000a ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ; Trent and Raetz , 2002 ) ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Modiﬁcation of the phosphate groups reduces the net negative charge on lipid A , promoting resistance to polymyxin and other cationic anti-microbial peptides ( Helander et al. , 1994 ; Nummila et al. , 1995 ; Gunn et al. , 2000a ; Trent and Raetz , 2002 ) . 
Despite considerable study of the regulation of genes thought to be involved in lipid A modiﬁcation , the actual structural modiﬁcations of lipid A that occur under commonly used growth conditions have not been investigated systematically . 
Even less is known about the chemistry of lipid A modiﬁcation during infection of mammalian cells , even though much effort has been devoted to studying the intracellular niche occupied by Salmonella ( Scherer and Miller , 2001 ) . 
Genes involved in modifying lipid A with L-Ara4N are maximally transcribed in mildly acidic , low-Mg2 + medium ( Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ) , but the structure lipid A was not studied directly . 
Earlier studies of regulated lipid A modiﬁcations were carried out under mildly alkaline , low-Mg2 + conditions ( Guo et al. , 1997 ) , and might have missed the contributions of low pH. We now demonstrate that lipid A is extensively modiﬁed when S. typhimurium replicates within mammalian cells , whereas it is largely unmodiﬁed when the bacteria are grown in tissue culture medium . 
Using murine RAW264 .7 macrophage-like tumour cells , we show that S. typhimu-rium lipid A acquires L-Ara4N , PEtN , and palmitate residues within hours of infection , but is modiﬁed with 2-hydroxymyristate under all conditions . 
In parallel , we have demonstrated that growth of S. typhimurium in acidic , low-Mg2 + minimal medium induces lipid A proﬁles that resemble those of bacteria growing inside RAW264 .7 cells , but that the effects of pH and low-Mg2 + are somewhat different . 
In contrast to previous reports ( Guo et al. , 1997 ; Gunn et al. , 2000b ) , we ﬁnd that 2-hydroxymyristate formation is largely PhoP/PhoQ independent . 
Although transcription of the Salmonella lpxO gene , which encodes the 2-hydroxylase , is induced two - to fourfold by growth on low Mg2 + , 2-hydroxymyristate modiﬁcation of lipid A is seen at comparable levels under all growth conditions , and in phoP-defective mutant strains . 
Growth at pH 6 ( but not low Mg2 + ) also triggers lipid A modiﬁcations in wild-type E. coli W3110 , suggesting a slightly different mechanism of lipid A regulation from in Salmonella . 
Mild acid-induced modiﬁcations of E. coli lipid A have not been reported previously .

Lipid A species produced by S. typhimurium and E. coli in changing environments . 
In high-Mg2 + medium , S. typhimurium lipid A is largely unmodiﬁed , much like that of E. coli with the exception that the 2-hydroxylation is not suppressed ( A ) . 
In response to low-Mg2 + conditions ( B ) , several covalent modiﬁcations of lipid A are induced in S. typhimurium , including 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose ( L-Ara4N ) and palmitate addition ( Guo et al. , 1997 ; 1998 ; Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
Modiﬁcation of lipid A with phosphoethanolamine ( PEtN ) , which can be induced in wild-type E. coli or S. typhimurium at pH 6 ( B ) , is also observed in polymyxin-resistant PmrA-constitutive mutants of S. typhimurium or E. coli along with the L-Ara4N substit-uent ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2001 ) . 
Modiﬁcations labelled in red are associated with activation of PhoP/PhoQ , while those labelled in blue are stimulated mainly by activation of PmrA/PmrB . 
The 2-hydroxy-myristate modiﬁcation ( in magenta ) was present under all growth conditions in the present studies . 
Results
Synergistic actions of Mg 2+ deprivation and low pH on lipid A modiﬁcation
The conditions experienced by S. typhimurium growing within macrophages are thought to be mildly acidic and low in divalent cations ( Alpuche Aranda et al. , 1992 ; Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ; Heithoff et al. , 1999 ) . 
We used Nminimal medium ( Nelson and Kennedy , 1971 ; Snavely et al. , 1991 ) as a model system to study the interactions between Mg2 + concentrations and extracellular pH on lipid A modiﬁcations . 
We also grew E. coli in the same medium to identify possible physiological triggers for lipid A modi-ﬁcation . 
In prior studies , E. coli lipid A modiﬁcations had been observed only in polymyxin-resistant mutants or in cells grown in LB broth containing 25 mM NH4VO3 ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
The lipid A species from 32P-labelled S. typhimurium and E. coli W3110 grown on acidic or mildly alkaline N-2 + minimal medium at low ( 8 mM ) or high ( 10 mM ) Mg were isolated and resolved by TLC ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The structures of the modiﬁed lipid A species separated by this system were previously characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) , and conﬁrmed in the present study by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry . 
As indicated schematically on the left side of Fig. 2 , the various lipid A species can be divided into four groups depending on their polar and/or fatty acyl chain modiﬁcations . 
Their structures are shown in Fig. 3 . 
At pH 7.5 and high Mg2 + , S. typhimurium lipid A closely resembles that of E. coli K-12 grown under similar conditions ( Fig. 2 , lanes 4 and 8 ) , consisting mainly of the classical hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphate ( m/z near 1797.8 in the negative mode mass spectrum ) and some of the lipid A 1-diphosphate ( m/z near 1877.9 ) 
Fig. 2 . 
Effects of pH and Mg2 + on lipid A modiﬁcations in S. typhimurium and E. coli . 
32P-labelled lipid A was isolated from S. typh-imurium or E. coli cells grown in N-minimal medium at the indicated pH and Mg2 + concentrations , either 8 mM ( L ) and 10 mM ( H ) . 
Lipid A species were resolved by TLC with the solvent system CHCl3/pyridine/88 % formic acid / H2O ( 50:50:16:5 , v/v ) . 
The arrows indicate the lipid A species modiﬁed with 2-hydroxy-myristate ( Gibbons et al. , 2000 ; Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
Lipid A species modiﬁed with both PEtN and 2-hydroxymyristate is indicated by the asterisk . 
The proposed structure of the lipid A species in each TLC group are shown in Fig. 3 . 
Isolation and mass spectrometry of lipid A species While the 32P-lipid A proﬁles are very informative ( Fig. 2 ) , the molecular compositions of the lipid A variants seen under the various growth conditions required further validation . 
Accordingly , litre-scale cultures were grown , and the lipid A species were recovered by pH 4.5 hydrolysis at 100 ∞ C as described ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
To facilitate interpretation , the lipid A species from these cultures were ﬁrst fractionated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
Increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate were used to elute lipid A species with increasing net negative charge . 
Fractionated lipid A species were then subjected to negative-mode MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry . 
The mass spectrometry of the various S. typhimurium lipid A species ( data not shown ) validated the structures shown in Fig. 3 , and conﬁrmed previous work ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
However , the modiﬁed E. coli lipid A variants seen at pH 6 ( Fig. 2 , lanes 5 and 6 ) had not been observed previously . 
MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the predominant lipid A species puriﬁed by DEAE cellulose column chromatography are shown in Fig . 
S1 in Supplementary material . 
The complete mass spectrometry data for all major and minor lipid A species recovered from E. coli cells grown under the four conditions are summarized in Table 1 . 
The pattern of modiﬁed lipid A variants synthesized by E. coli in response to acidic pH and/or low extracellular Mg2 + differs from that of S. typhimurium . 
None of the conditions studied induced the formation of hepta-acylated lipid A in E. coli , which is prominent in S. typhimurium grown in low Mg2 + . 
Although PEtN modiﬁcation is induced at low pH in both organisms , the relative incorporation of PEtN is much greater in E. coli ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ) . 
Lipid A molecules containing two PEtN residues are especially prominent in E. coli ( Table 1 ) , whereas wild-type S. typhimurium mainly modiﬁes the 1-position with PEtN when L-Ara4N synthesis is ongoing ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
S. typhimurium , however , is capable of modifying its lipid A with two L-Ara4N groups ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) , a combination not seen in E. coli under our conditions ( Table 1 ) . 
Furthermore , the biosynthesis of L-Ara4N in E. coli is induced in acidic medium only at low 2 + Mg ( Table 1 ) , and even then it is a relatively minor component . 
In contrast , L-Ara4N is synthesized in S. typh-2 + imurium at pH 6 in the presence of both high and low Mg . 
The 2-hydroxymyristate variant is absent in all preparations of E. coli lipid A because E. coli lacks the lpxO gene ( Gibbons et al. , 2000 ) . 
Fig. 3 . 
Proposed structures of lipid A species found in S. typhimurium under various conditions . 
In the TLC solvent system used in Fig. 2 , and in Figs 4 and 6 -- 8 , Group 1 designates residual glycerophospholipids ( structures not shown ) or minor lipid A degradation products that have lost their 1-phosphate moiety resulting from pH 4.5 hydrolysis at 100 ∞ C ; Group 2 is the set of lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphate species not containing any additional polar modiﬁcations other than 2-hydroxymyristate ; Group 3 is the collection of lipid A species containing a single polar modiﬁcation on the 1 - or 4 cents - phosphate moieties ; and Group 4 is the mixture of lipid A species bearing two polar modiﬁcations , as indicated . 
Variants with L-Ara4N at the 1-position are much less abundant than those with PEtN at the 1-position . 
The structures proposed in the present work are based on our previous in-depth NMR analyses of lipid A molecules from Salmonella ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) , and were not determined independently with the lipid A species isolated from macrophages , other than by their migration with standards during TLC . 
( Fig. 2 , lanes 5 versus 6 , and 7 versus 8 ) ; alternatively , it may be that the phospholipid cosubstrate needed for PagP catalysis can not reach the outer surface of the outer membrane in E. coli , where the PagP active site is located ( Hwang et al. , 2002 ) . 
Under acidic growth conditions ( pH 6.0 ) with 10 mM Mg2 + , both S. typhimurium and E. coli synthesize lipid A species with one or two polar modiﬁcations ( Fig. 2 , lanes 2 and 6 ) , as judged by the presence of new molecular species migrating in Groups 3 and 4 . 
Maximal induction of polar lipid A modiﬁcations occurred in S. typhimurium grown at pH 6 with 8 mM Mg2 + ( Fig. 2 , lane 1 versus lane 2 ) . 
There was little effect of lowering the Mg2 + concentration on the composition of lipid A in E. coli cells grown at pH 6 ( Fig. 2 , lanes 5 and 6 ) . 
( Fig. 1A ) . 
The only signiﬁcant difference was the presence of 2-hydroxymyristate-modiﬁed variants in the lipid A of S. typhimurium ( Fig. 1A ) , which migrate just below the myristate-containing species ( Fig. 2 , lane 4 , arrows ) . 
At pH 7.5 and 8 mM Mg2 + , only S. typhimurium synthesizes signiﬁcant amounts of many additional , more slowly migrating polar variants ( Fig. 2 , lane 3 versus lane 7 ) . 
Mass spectrometry of the S. typhimurium lipid A ( data not shown ) reveals that L-Ara4N-modiﬁed species predominate under these conditions . 
The S. typhimurium lipid A variants in Group 4 with two polar modiﬁcations ( Fig. 2 , lane 3 ) result from the incorporation of two L-Ara4N moieties . 
When grown at pH 7.5 and 8 mM Mg2 + , S. typhimu-rium also synthesizes two more rapidly migrating species in each group , which is most clearly evident in Group 2 ( Fig. 2 , lane 3 ) . 
These substances arise from the activity of the PagP acyltransferase and the incorporation of a seventh acyl chain ( Fig. 3 ) . 
PagP is apparently not activated in E. coli at 8 mM Mg2 + , either at pH 6 or at pH 7.5

PhoP and PmrA independence of lipid A 2-hydroxylation at high Mg2 + 
The observation that wild-type S. typhimurium makes lipid A containing 2-hydroxymyristate when grown under conditions thought to inactivate the PhoP/PhoQ system ( Fig. 2 , lane 4 ) prompted us to reinvestigate the role of PhoP and PmrA in the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxymyristate .

P , unsubstituted monophosphate ; di-P , unsubstituted diphosphate ; P-PEtN , diphosphoethanolamine ; P-L-Ara4N , phospho-L-Ara4N . 
Wild-type S. typhimurium 14028s and mutants lacking phoP , pmrA or both were grown in N-minimal medium containing 10 mM Mg2 + at either pH 6.0 or pH 7.5 ( Fig. 4 ) . 
In all cases , ª 30 % of the lipid A isolated from these strains contained 2-hydroxymyristate ( as seen most clearly for Group 2 ) , which disappeared only when the lpxO gene was mutated ( Fig. 4 , lanes 9 and 10 , right arrow ) . 
As anticipated , the modiﬁcation of lipid A with polar moieties other than the diphosphate ( Fig. 1A ) was absolutely dependent on pmrA at pH 6 ( Fig. 5 , lane 1 versus lane 5 ) . 
However , the formation at pH 6 of lipid A species containing both L-Ara4N and PEtN was somewhat diminished in the phoP-null background ( Fig. 4 , lane 1 versus 3 ) , indicating that the PhoP/PhoQ system remains partially active at 10 mM Mg2 + . 
When additional 10 mM Ca2 + was included to suppress all residual PhoP/PhoQ activity , L-Ara4N biosynthesis in wild-type cells was reduced to the levels seen in the phoP-null mutant ( Fig. 4 , lane 3 ) , but 2-hydroxymyristate biosynthesis was still unaffected ( data not shown ) . 
These results show that under our conditions the 2-hydroxylation of lipid A occurs independently of the PhoP/PhoQ and the PmrA/PmrB systems . 
Partial induction of the lpxO gene by growth on low Mg2 + 
A reporter construct in which the lpxO promoter was fused to the b-galactosidase gene ( Fig. 5A ) was used to evaluate the effects of growth on low Mg2 + and the role of the PhoP/PhoQ system in the transcription of lpxO . 
As shown in Fig. 5B , a shift to low Mg2 + increased lpxO transcription about 2.5-fold at pH 6 , and fourfold at pH 7.5 . 
This result is consistent with the idea that 2-hydroxylation is phoP dependent , but the magnitude of the effect is apparently too small to alter the extent of lipid A 2-hydroxylation ( Fig. 4 ) . 
At pH 6 and to a lesser extent at pH 7.5 , transcription of the lpxO reporter was increased versus wildtype cells , when introduced into a PhoP constitutive background ( Fig. 5C ) . 
However , transcription was not suppressed signiﬁcantly when the reporter construct was transferred to a phoP-negative mutant ( Fig. 5C ) . 
We conclude that a signiﬁcant basal level of lpxO transcription is maintained in the absence of phoP/phoQ regulation , consistent with the presence of 2-hydroxylated lipid A species under all growth conditions ( Fig. 4 ) .

Suppression of all lipid A modiﬁcations except for 2-hydroxylation at high pH
As shown in Fig. 6 ( lanes 3 , 5 and 7 ) , growth at pH 8 in the presence of 10 mM Mg2 + suppressed the lipid A modiﬁcations seen at pH 6 not only in wild-type cells , but also in the phoPc ( pho-24 ) and pmrAc mutants . 
At pH 8.0 , the phoPc strain yielded mainly unmodiﬁed lipid A , and was indistinguishable from wild type . 
However , the lipid A spe-cies containing 2-hydroxymyristate were still present ( Fig. 6 , Group 2 , right arrow ) , consistent with the basal transcription of lpxO in the absence of PhoP ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Some L-Ara4N-modiﬁed lipid A molecules were still present in the pmrAc ( pmrA505 ) mutant grown at pH 8.0 , but even their levels were much diminished compared with pH 6.0 ( Fig. 6 , lanes 6 and 7 ) . 
The dramatic reduction in L-Ara4N - and PEtN-modiﬁed lipid A species seen in the pmrAc mutant at pH 8 is consistent with the fact that this strain becomes sensitive to polymyxin when grown under alkaline , high-Mg2 + conditions ( Groisman et al. , 1997 ) . 
Modiﬁcation of lipid A during intracellular growth of S. typhimurium We isolated 32P-labelled lipid A from S. typhimurium that had been grown within RAW264 .7 murine macrophagelike tumour cells in the presence of 32Pi ( Fig. 7 ) . 
The infection procedure was based on intracellular survival and multiplication assays ( Fields et al. , 1986 ; Monack et al. , 1996 ) in which the growth of extracellular bacteria is suppressed by the membrane-impermeant antibiotic 7 gentamicin . 
Approximately 10 RAW264 .7 cells were utilized for each experiment , yielding about 108 intracellular

Salmonella 14028s is the wild-type parent . 
The only mutation that causes the disappearance of the 2-hydroxymyristate-modiﬁed species ( arrow ) is lpxO .

After the removal of 32P-labelled host cell phospholipids by an initial chloroform/methanol extraction , the various 32P-labelled lipid A species were released from the chlo-roform/methanol-insoluble LPS of the internalized bacteria by pH 4.5 hydrolysis at 100 ∞ C ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2001 ) . 
The 32P-labelled lipid A species were then extracted into a fresh chloroform phase ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
Viable bacteria recoverable from the culture medium accounted for less than 2 % of the total viable population ( Fig. 7A ) , ruling out the possibility that lipid A species seen by 32Pi-labelling ( Fig. 7B ) are derived from extracellular bacteria .

While pH 6 activated both systems , lipid A modiﬁcations in the phoPc strain were completely suppressed by growth under mildly alkaline conditions . 
A small amount of residual L-Ara4N-modiﬁed lipid A does remain in the pmrAc strain at pH 8 .

Growth of S. typhimurium inside RAW264 .7 cells and 32Pi labelling of lipid A made by internalized bacteria . 
A. Unlabelled cells were infected with S. typhimurium and harvested at the indicated times in parallel with the radioactively labelled cells shown in ( B ) . 
The titre of bacteria growing extracellularly and intrac-ellularly was determined by dilution plating of the medium or of the 0.1 % Triton X-100 lysate of the RAW264 .7 cell monolayer respectively . 
Light shading indicates colony-forming units residing in the tissue culture medium ; dark shading indicates colony-forming units obtained from the 0.1 % Triton X-100 lysate of the infected macroph-age monolayer before or after the 14 h allowed for labelling . 
B. 32Pi labelling ( 5 mCi ml-1 ) of extracellular bacteria grown in tissue culture medium ( DMEM , left two lanes ) , or of uninfected control or infected RAW264 .7 monolayers ( right two lanes ) . 
Extracellular bacteria ( wild type or a phoPC mutant ) were grown for 4 h in DMEM lacking gentamicin in the presence of 32Pi . 
Cultures of uninfected or infected RAW264 .7 cells were grown for 14 h with 32Pi , after which the 32P-labelled lipid A species were isolated . 
A minor , host-cell-derived 32P-labelled lipid ( question mark ) migrated near the S. typhimurium hexa-acylated lipid A species ( second lane from right ) . 
However , this did not interfere with the analysis of the predominant modiﬁed lipid A species seen in wild-type S. typhimurium during intracellular growth ( far right lane ) . 
Lipid A species were resolved by TLC with the solvent system CHCl3/pyridine/88 % formic acid/H2O ( 50:50:16:5 , v/v ) . 
Using the calibrated TLC system described in Fig. 2 ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2001 ) , it is possible to resolve many of the modiﬁed lipid A species formed when the PhoP/PhoQ and/or the PmrA/PmrB systems are activated ( Figs 7B and 8 ) . 
The lipid A proﬁle from the infected RAW264 .7 cells differs radically from that of bacteria grown in tissue culture medium ( Fig. 7B , lane 4 versus lane 1 ) . 
The pattern seen with infected RAW264 .7 cells resembles that observed with S. typhimurium grown at pH 6 and 8 mM Mg2 + ( Fig. 2 ) . 
To eliminate the possibility that short exposure to gentamicin induced the observed effects , gentamicin ( 10 mg ml-1 ) and 32Pi were added to wild-type bacteria growing in tissue culture medium in the absence of RAW264 .7 cells . 
No modiﬁed lipid A species were observed ( data not shown ) . 
When a phoP mutant was used to infect RAW264 .7 cells under identical conditions in the presence of 32Pi and gentamicin , the bacteria did not proliferate in or around the RAW cells , even thought they grew well in Dulbecco 's Modiﬁed Eagle 's Medium ( DMEM ) in the absence of gentamicin ( data not shown ) . 
This control demonstrates that only intracellular growth can explain the results shown in Figs 7B and 8 ( Miller et al. , 1989 ) . 
Uninfected RAW264 .7 cells that were 32Pi labelled , solvent extracted , and then hydrolysed at pH 4.5 in parallel with infected cells produced small amounts of an unidentiﬁed lipid that migrated in the vicinity of the unmodiﬁed lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphate ( Fig. 7B , lane 3 question mark , and Fig. 8 , lane 1 ) . 
This substance is uncharged , as it does not bind to DEAE cellulose ( data not shown ) , and it is therefore not lipid A . 
The more abundant , modiﬁed lipid A species seen in the infected RAW cells are largely resolved from each other , and are separated from residual macrophage lipids ( Figs 7B and 8 ) . 
Fig. 8 . 
Lipid A species generated during intracellular growth of various S. typhimurium mutants . 
A panel of S. typhimurium mutants with defects in one or more lipid A-modifying enzymes or regulatory genes was generated by transduction using the P22-HT105-int bacterioph-age . 
RAW264 .7 cells were infected with wild-type or mutant Salmo-32 nella strains , and the intracellular P-labelled lipid A species were detected and analysed as in Fig. 7 . 
Modiﬁed lipid A species are grouped according to their polar modiﬁcations , as explained in Fig. 3 . 
Within each group , a total of four lipid A variants are possible , representing the addition of an extra palmitate group and/or the 2-hydroxylation of myristate ( see Fig. 3 ) . 
Lipid A in Group 2 is largely the classical lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphate . 
Lipid A in Group 3 has a single polar modiﬁcation with either L-Ara4N or PEtN . 
In some cases , however , the 1-diphosphate species replaces the 1-phosphate ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Lipid A species in Group 4 each contain two polar modiﬁcations ( mainly L-Ara4N and/or PEtN ) . 
Absence of selected intracellular lipid A modiﬁcations in S. typhimurium mutants lacking ugd , pagP , and/or lpxO genes 
To validate the identities of the labelled lipid A species , we generated new mutant strains in which one or more of the genes involved in lipid A modiﬁcation were inactivated . 
These include ugd ( pmrE ) , lpxO and pagP , which encode enzymes required for modiﬁcation of lipid A with L-Ara4N , 
Lipid A modiﬁcations of intracellular Salmonella 433 2-hydroxymyristate and palmitate respectively ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ; Guo et al. , 1998 ; Bishop et al. , 2000 ; Gibbons et al. , 2000 ) . 
These mutations alone and in combination did not signiﬁcantly affect bacterial replication within the RAW264 .7 cells ( data not shown ) . 
The intracellular lipid A proﬁles of the various mutants are shown in Fig. 8 . 
To facilitate interpretation , the lipid A species were grouped into sets of four based on their migration , as in Figs 2 and 3 . 
Within each of these groups , hepta-acylated lipid A generated by PagP migrates faster than the hexa-acylated form , and the lipid A derivatives containing 2-hydroxymyristate migrate more slowly than their nonhydroxylated counterparts ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2001 ) . 
Lipid A isolated from RAW264 .7 cells infected with S. typhimurium lacking one or more lipid A-modifying enzymes displayed altered lipid A proﬁles ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Deletion of lpxO collapses the characteristic doublets into single bands ( Fig. 8 , lane 2 versus 3 ; lane 4 versus 5 ; lane 6 versus 7 ) , as is most clearly evident in Group 2 , indicating loss of the 2-hydroxylated lipid A variants ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Mutation of pagP causes the loss of the faster-migrating forms within each group characteristic of the hepta-acy-lated lipid A species ( Fig. 8 , lane 2 versus 6 ; lane 3 versus 7 ; lane 5 versus 8 ) . 
Loss of ugd alters the distribution of lipid A variants between Groups 3 and 4 in favour of Group 3 ( Fig. 8 , lane 2 versus 4 ; lane 3 versus 5 ; lane 7 versus 8 ) , as expected for a mutant that does not make L-Ara4N ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ) . 
When mutations in ugd , lpxO and pagP are combined ( Fig. 8 , lane 8 ) , two major species are evident in Group 3 , probably reﬂecting the presence of two discrete lipid A forms modiﬁed either at the 1 - or the 4 cents - phosphate positions with PEtN , the only lipid A modiﬁcation ( other than the 1-diphosphate ) that is still possible in the triple mutant ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
The lipid A species seen in Group 4 ( Fig. 8 , lane 8 ) in the triple mutant is probably modiﬁed with two PEtN moieties ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) . 
A pmrA deﬁcient mutant ( Fig. 8 , lane 9 ) does not attach either PEtN or L-Ara4N groups to its lipid A ( Fig. 1 ) when grown in RAW264 .7 cells . 
Accordingly , the palmitoylated and 2-hydroxylated forms the lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphates ( Group 2 ) predominate ( Fig. 8 , lane 9 ) . 
However , traces of Group 3 lipid A species can also be seen ( Fig. 8 , lane 9 ) ; these probably represent variants bearing the 1-diphosphate moiety ( Fig. 1A ) ( Zhou et al. , 2001 ) , which migrate slightly faster than lipid A species decorated with a single PEtN unit . 
In summary , lipid A from wild-type Salmonella growing inside RAW264 .7 cells is heavily modiﬁed with L-Ara4N , PEtN , 2-hydroxymyristate and palmitate , when compared with the same bacteria grown in tissue culture medium ( Fig. 7B , lane 4 versus 1 ) . 
The pH and Mg2 + concentration of the tissue culture medium are high enough to suppress these lipid A modiﬁcations not just in wild-type but also in 
434 H. S. Gibbons , S. R. Kalb , R. J. Cotter and C. R. H. phoPC mutant bacteria ( Fig. 7B , lane 2 ) , consistent with the results of Fig. 6 .

Discussion
Our radiochemical proﬁles clearly indicate that pH and Mg2 + concentrations act together to induce maximal modiﬁcation of lipid A , and that acidic , low-Mg2 + growth conditions ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ) most resemble the intracellular environment of S. typhimurium-containing phagosomes of RAW264 .7 cells ( Figs 7B and 8 ) . 
These results are consistent with the work of Alpuche Aranda et al. ( 1992 ) , who showed that phagosomes of RAW264 .7 cells acidify within hours after internalization of S. typhimurium and that RAW264 .7 cells create a phagosomal environment low in Mg2 + . 
Furthermore , our results are consistent with the work of Valdivia and Falkow ( 1997 ) , who demonstrated that ugd is induced in the RAW264 .7 cell environment . 
S. typhimurium lipid A isolated from intracellular bacteria ( Figs 7B and 8 ) contained an unexpectedly high amount of hepta-acylated lipid A ( the product of PagP ) , the expression of which is strongly induced by PhoP/PhoQ activation ( Guo et al. , 1998 ; Belden and Miller , 1994 ) . 
The presence of anti-microbial defence peptides inside phagolysosomes may account for the additional activation of the PhoP/PhoQ system seen in the RAW cells ( Bader et al. , 2003 ) . 
Modiﬁcation of lipid A in S. typhimurium and E. coli is a complex process that involves multiple enzymes and takes place in several different locations within the cell envelope ( Raetz and Whitﬁeld , 2002 ) . 
Modiﬁcation with 2-hydroxymyristate occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane ( Doerrler et al. , 2004 ) , while addition of L-Ara4N and PEtN occur on the periplasmic face ( Trent et al. , 2001a , b ; Doerrler et al. , 2004 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
In contrast , palmitate is transferred to lipid A in the outer membrane ( Bishop et al. , 2000 ; Hwang et al. , 2002 ) . 
The percentage of the lipid A that is modiﬁed will depend both on the expression of the modifying enzymes and on factors such as growth rate or outer membrane stress , which could determine the availability of the phospholipid cosubstrate in the case of PagP . 
An unanticipated result was the lack of suppression of lipid A 2-hydroxylation by high concentrations of Mg2 + ( Fig. 2 ) , or by mutation of the phoP gene ( Fig. 4 ) . 
We attribute this ﬁnding to the basal level of lpxO transcription that is phoP/phoQ independent ( Fig. 5 ) , and it is consistent with the fact that LpxO was never discovered as a Pag gene . 
Only the inactivation of the lpxO gene eliminates 2-hydroxylation of lipid A entirely ( Fig. 5 , lane 10 ) . 
Previous data suggesting that lipid A 2-hydroxyla-tion is PhoP/PhoQ dependent might reﬂect differences in the basal level of lpxO transcription in different strains or , possibly , in the control of the oxygen tension at the time of harvest , which is critical for efﬁcient 2-hydroxylation ( Gibbons et al. , 2000 ) . 
Furthermore , micromolar levels of extracellular Mn2 + suppress the 2-hydroxylation of lipid A threefold when the Fe2 + concentration of the medium is low , but this effect is not accompanied by suppression of the basal level of transcription ( Gibbons , 2003 ) . 
Suppression of lipid A 2-hydroxylation is Mn2 + speciﬁc . 
It occurs at > 0.3 mM Mn2 + but is not evident when 0.3 mM Fe2 + is provided in addition to Mn2 + . 
Therefore , accurate control of the concentrations of iron and Mn2 + , in addition to dissolved O2 , may be necessary to achieve consistent levels of 2-hydroxy-myristate levels in living cells . 
Soncini and Groisman previously demonstrated that acidic growth conditions cooperate with low levels of Mg2 + to induce maximal polymyxin resistance and transcriptional activity of genes ( yjdB/pmrC/pagB and pmrF ) involved in lipid A modiﬁcation ( Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ; Groisman et al. , 1997 ) . 
Our observations are consistent with a synergistic interaction between acidic growth conditions and low Mg2 + in both S. typhimurium and E. coli ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The neutral to mildly alkaline growth conditions used previously do not induce PEtN modiﬁcation to high levels , and may explain the absence of PEtNmodiﬁed lipid A species in some previous studies ( Guo et al. , 1997 ; 1998 ) . 
In the present work we also identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time a physiological trigger for lipid A modiﬁcation in wild-type E. coli K-12 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Earlier studies had shown that lipid A isolated from polymyxin-resistant mutants contains L-Ara4N and PEtN modiﬁcations ( Nummila et al. , 1995 ) , but wild-type E. coli K-12 was not known to attach these modiﬁcations to lipid A when grown in LB broth , unless 25 mM ammonium metavanadate was added ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) . 
Our radiochemical and mass spectrometry data demonstrate conclusively that extracellular pH is an especially good trigger for modiﬁcation of E. coli lipid A with PEtN ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ) . 
In addition , E. coli responds to low Mg2 + as a stimulus for L-Ara4N biosynthesis , but only under acidic growth conditions , whereas in S. typhimurium L-Ara4N is induced in low Mg2 + medium both at pH 7.5 and at pH 6.0 . 
These observations suggest that the interaction between the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB systems differs slightly in S. typhimurium and E. coli . 
Our inability to observe hepta-acylated lipid A in E. coli correlates with the fact that elevated transcription of crcA , the E. coli homologue of pagP , requires the activation of at least one other 2-component regulatory system in addition to PhoP / PhoQ ( Eguchi et al. , 2004 ) . 
In this regard , it is worth noting that Guo et al. ( 1998 ) observed Mg2 + - regulated addition of palmitate , but their studies used a clinical isolate of E. coli that may differ from the laboratory-adapted K-12 strains . 
PagP also requires that phospholipids reach the outer surface of the outer membrane ( Bishop et al. , 
2000 ; Hwang et al. , 2002 ) , a process about which little is known . 
Recently , our laboratory has determined that yjdB / pmrC/pagB gene encodes the phosphoethanolamine transferase that adds to the PEtN moiety to the 1 - and/or 4 cents - phosphate groups of lipid A ( Trent and Raetz , 2002 ) , now designated EptA . 
Lee et al. have recently arrived at the same conclusion , and in addition , demonstrated that the EptA/PmrC active site faces the periplasm ( Doerrler et al. , 2004 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ) . 
Transcriptional regulation of the yjdB/pmrC/pagB / eptA had been extensively studied in S. typhimurium before the recent elucidation of its function ( Gunn and Miller , 1996 ; Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ; Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ; Gunn et al. , 2000a ; Brodsky et al. , 2002 ) , but its regulation in E. coli had not been determined . 
We are currently evaluating the effects of mutating the eptA gene on polymyxin resistance in S. typhimurium and in E. coli . 
Our preliminary data suggest only a modest effect on polymyxin resistance , in contrast to the complete loss of resistance associated with mutations in L-Ara4N . 
The mechanism by which extracellular pH modulates lipid A modiﬁcations remains to be elucidated in depth . 
Induction of lipid A modiﬁcations at low pH clearly requires PmrA ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Some investigators have speculated that PmrB senses both Fe3 + and acidic pH ( Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ; Wosten et al. , 2000 ) and is largely independent of PhoP/PhoQ . 
However , some reports indicate that low pH-induced transcription of PmrA-dependent genes can occur in the absence of PmrB ( Groisman , 2001 ) . 
The absence of modiﬁed lipid A spe-cies in the pmrAc strain at pH 8.0 is consistent with work of Soncini and Groisman ( 1996 ) , which demonstrated that the pmrAc strain is much more sensitive to poly-myxin when grown under alkaline , high-Mg2 + conditions . 
These conditions might suppress synthesis of the constitutively active PmrA , thus disrupting a positive feedback loop necessary for polymyxin resistance ( Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ) . 
It is not clear how lipid A modiﬁcations in the phoPc strain are suppressed by growth in mildly alkaline medium . 
The absence of polar modiﬁcations probably results from inactivation of PmrA/PmrB by elevated extracellular pH , but the reason ( s ) for the disappearance of palmitoylated lipid A at pH 8.0 is unclear ( Fig. 6 ) . 
We have observed similar effects when the phoPc strain is grown in tissue culture medium , which is buffered at pH 7.4 ( Fig. 7B ) . 
The fact that palmitoylated lipid A is absent in the phoPc strain at pH 8.0 indicates that alkaline pH might repress the PhoP/PhoQ-regulated lipid A modiﬁcations by a novel mechanism , as PhoQ supposedly senses Mg2 + and Ca2 + , but not pH ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) . 
It may be that pagP belongs to the subset of PhoP-dependent genes that require low pH for maximal transcription ( Alpu ¬ 
Lipid A modiﬁcations of intracellular Salmonella 435 che Aranda et al. , 1992 ; Bearson et al. , 1998 ; Groisman , 2001 ) . 
While survival within macrophages is important for systemic infections , S. typhimurium also invades and proliferates in epithelial cells of the small intestine ( Scherer and Miller , 2001 ) and in dendritic cells ( Niedergang et al. , 2000 ) . 
Differences in the requirement for PhoP/PhoQ for proliferation in various animal cell types suggest that the formation of modiﬁed lipid A species may vary according to the cell type colonized . 
Using the methods detailed in this report , it should be possible to study Salmonella lipid A modiﬁcations associated with the infection of different animal cell types , or those induced in diverse Gramnegative bacteria that employ distinct intracellular survival strategies , such as Legionella pneumophila , Francisella tularensis or Brucella melitensis .

Construction of S. typhimurium mutants
All relevant strains and plasmids are listed in Table 2 . 
The S. typhimurium strain carrying the lpxO : : kan insertion ( designated HG002 ) was constructed by a modiﬁcation of the method of Julio et al. ( 1998 ) and Nicholson and Low ( 2000 ) . 
The suicide vector pHSG9 , which is derived from pCVD442 ( Donnenberg and Kaper , 1991 ) and contains a mutant lpxO gene with an inserted kanamycin cassette ( lpxO : : kan ) ( Gibbons , 2003 ) , was transferred from DL1840 to S. typhimurium by conjugation . 
Single cross-over integrants were selected by their sensitivity to sucrose and resistance to ampicillin and kanamycin . 
After overnight outgrowth without ampicillin , mutants that retained only the lpxO : : kan mutation were selected on plates containing kanamycin and 5 % sucrose . 
These colonies were ampicillin sensitive , and after puriﬁcation , one such mutant was conﬁrmed to lack lipid A containing 2-hydroxymyristate . 
A strain carrying an lpxO : : cam mutation was constructed , as described for HG002 , using the chloramphenicol resistance cassette excised from pACYC184 with BstYI and NheI . 
The excised cam cassette was ﬁlled in and blunt-end cloned into SmaI-digested pHSG5 to make pHSG17 . 
The resulting lpxO : : cam fragment was cut from pHSG17 with SacII and KpnI , ﬁlled in , and was blunt-end cloned into SmaI-cut pCVD442 . 
The resulting suicide vector containing the lpxO : : cam construct was then transferred into S. typhimurium exactly as described above for the construction of HG002 . 
To conﬁrm the chromosomal localization of the chloramphenicol cassette , the lpxO : : kan locus was transduced into HG016 using the bacteriophage P22HT105-int ; 100 % ( n = 14 ) of the resulting transductant strains carried the lpxO : : kan marker , indicating correct integration at the lpxO locus of the chloramphenicol resistance gene . 
The remaining strains ( isogenic to 14028s , Table 2 ) were also constructed by bacteriophage transduction ( Davis et al. , 1980 ) , using P22-HT105-int ( Salmonella Genetic Stock Center ) in conjunction with the appropriate donor strains , generously provided by Dr S.I. Miller ( University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA ) . 
A reporter gene system to monitor lpxO transcription
The construction of the lpxO reporter is outlined in Fig. 5A . 
The 548 base pairs upstream of the translation start site of lpxO were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using the primers HG35 ( 5 cents - CCGAAGCTTTATCGTTTAG CGCTGCGCAAC-3 cents ) and HG36 ( 5 cents - AATCATGGTCATCTCC TTACTGTCCTTCTAAGAAAACC-3 cents ) to generate a PCR product that overlaps with the 5 cents region of the E. coli lacZ gene , and places an optimized ribosomal binding site in front of the lacZYA translation start site . 
An 1159 bp fragment of the lacZ coding sequence was ampliﬁed from the lacZYAcontaining plasmid pDAL445 , a derivative of pRS551 ( Simons et al. , 1987 ) containing an additional restriction site in its multiple cloning cassette , using primers HG38 ( 5 cents ¬ 
AGTaaggagatgaccatgattacggattc-3 cents ) and MKV9 ( 5 cents - GA GCCGGCTAGCGATGGA-CTGGGCATTTCA-3 cents ) ( VorachekWarren , 2002 ) . 
HG38 contains a sequence that overlaps with the 3 cents end of the region upstream of lpxO . 
A PCR product containing the region 5 cents of lpxO fused to the fragment of lacZ was generated by amplifying a longer product from a mixture of the shorter products using primers HG35 and MKV9 . 
The longer product was then digested with EcoRV ( located in the middle of the lacZ gene ) and HindIII ( located in the upstream multiple cloning cassette ) . 
This fragment was cloned into similarly digested pMKV54 , a lacZYA reporter plasmid derived from pACYC177 , containing the promoter of lpxP fused to lacZYA ( Vorachek-Warren , 2002 ) . 
The resulting plasmid , designated pHSG29 , contained 548 bp of the putative promoter region of lpxO fused directly to the lacZYA operon with the removal of all lpxP DNA ( Fig. 5A ) . 
The reporter construct was transformed into various S. typhimurium strains by electroporation ( 400 mW , 25 mF , 2.5 kV ) , and transformants were selected on LB broth containing ampicillin ( 100 mg ml-1 ) . 
Assays for lpxO promoter-driven b-galactosidase activity , as measured by the enzymatic hydrolysis of ortho-nitrophenyl galactoside , were carried out according to standard procedures ( Miller , 1972 ) . 
Bacterial cultures ( 1.5 ml volume ) were grown in N-minimal medium ( Snavely et al. , 1991 ) buffered in 100 mM of either MES ( pH 6.0 ) or Hepes ( pH 7.5 ) , containing 0.4 % glucose , 0.1 % casamino acids , and either 8 mM or 10 mM MgCl2 . 
All experiments were performed in triplicate . 
Results are presented as the average ± the standard deviation from a representative experiment .

Growth of Salmonella inside RAW264.7 cells in the presence of 32Pi
RAW264 .7 cells were maintained in 75 cm2 tissue culture ﬂasks in DMEM containing 10 % FBS , penicillin G and streptomycin sulphate ( 50 units ml-1 and 50 mg ml-1 respectively ) . 
The cells were passaged every 2 -- 3 days by scraping with a rubber policeman and repeated pipetting to yield suspensions of single cells . 
Cultures were maintained at 37 ∞ C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 . 
Infection experiments were carried out using a modiﬁcation of previously reported procedures ( Monack et al. , 1996 ) . 
RAW264 .7 cells were seeded ( 107 cells per 75 cm2 ﬂask ) and allowed to adhere overnight . 
The adherent cells were washed twice with PBS before infection , at which point the medium was replaced with DMEM/FBS lacking antibiotics . 
Bacteria ( 0.5 ml volume ) from fresh overnight cultures were opsonized for 30 min at 37 ∞ C in 5 ml of DMEM containing 20 % mouse serum . 
The bacterial suspension was added to each monolayer such that the ratio of infecting bacteria to host cells was approximately 100:1 . 
The bacteria were centrifuged onto the cells at 300 g for 5 min to synchronize infection ( Monack et al. , 1996 ) . 
Bacteria were allowed to invade for 30 min , after which the RAW cells were washed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent bacteria . 
The medium was replaced with 30 ml of DMEM/10 % FBS containing 100 mg ml-1 gentamicin to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . 
After 2 h , the medium was replaced with 30 ml of DMEM/10 % FBS containing 10 mg ml-1 gentamicin , 0.09 mM Na2HPO4 , 5 mCi ml-1 32Pi and 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 ( BRL cell culture grade ) . 
Bacteria were allowed to grow intracellularly for 12 -- 14 h , after which the monolayers were scraped into 5 ml of PBS , transferred to a 13 ml test tube and centrifuged . 
Extraction of 32P-labelled lipid A from infected RAW264.7 cells
The isolation of 32P-labelled lipid A from infected mammalian cells was modelled on the procedure of Zhou et al. ( 1999 ) . 
The centrifuged RAW264 .7 cell pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS , to which was added 2 ml of MeOH and 1 ml of CHCl3 to form a single-phase Bligh/Dyer system . 
Phospholipids are soluble in this system , while LPS , protein and DNA are insoluble . 
Cell pellets were extracted for 30 min , after which the precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 20 min in a tabletop clinical centrifuge . 
The pellet was washed twice with 4 ml of a single-phase Bligh/Dyer system , consisting of CHCl3/MeOH/H2O ( 1:2:0.8 , v/v ) to remove residual phospholipids . 
The pellet was dispersed by bath sonication in 1.8 ml of 12.5 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.5 in the presence of 1 % SDS . 
Next the suspension was incubated at 100 ∞ C for 30 min to cleave the mild acid labile Kdo -- lipid A linkage . 
Lipid A was then extracted from the hydrolysate by adding 2 ml each of CHCl3 and MeOH to form a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system , consisting of CHCl3/MeOH/H2O ( 2:2:1.8 , v/v ) . 
After thorough mixing and centrifugation , the lower phase was removed , washed once with fresh , pre-equilibrated upper phase and dried under N2 . 
The radioactive lipid A species were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH ( 4:1 v/v ) , resolved by TLC and detected by PHOSPHOIMAGER analysis ( Molecular Dynamics ) . 
Titre of intracellular bacteria
To obtain counts of viable intracellular bacteria , the RAW264 .7 cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed with 5 ml of 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min . 
The viable bacteria were counted by appropriate dilution and plating on LB agar . 
Radiochemical lipid A proﬁling of bacteria grown in a deﬁned minimal medium
Except as noted , bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium ( Nelson and Kennedy , 1971 ) with 0.4 % glucose and 0.1 % casamino acids , buffered as indicated either with 100 mM MES ( pH 6.0 ) or 100 mM Hepes ( pH 7.0 -- 8.0 ) . 
Substitution of glucose for glycerol in this minimal medium accelerated the growth rate of the bacteria , but did not affect the lipid A proﬁles ( data not shown ) . 
Lipid A from S. typhimurium and E. coli grown on minimal medium or the DMEM tissue culture medium was 32Pi-labelled and isolated according to previously published procedures ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ) with minor modiﬁcations . 
Cultures ( 5 ml volume ) were grown in 25 ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks rather than disposable culture tubes to ensure sufﬁcient aeration . 
Cultures were labelled with 32Pi ( 2 -- 5 mCi ml-1 ) , but the PBS wash of the initial cell pellet was eliminated in order to reduce the cell loss of the relatively loose S. typhimurium cell pellet . 
The insoluble material from the single-phase extraction was washed once with a singlephase Bligh -- Dyer mixture , resuspended , hydrolysed and extracted exactly as above . 
Isolation of lipid A for mass spectrometry
Lipid A was prepared from 1 l of cultures of S. typhimurium or E. coli grown in N-minimal medium in the presence of either 10 mM or 8 mM Mg2 + as previously published ( Zhou et al. , 1999 ; 2000 ; 2001 ) . 
Lipid A isolated by hydrolysis at pH 4.5 in the presence of SDS was redissolved in 8 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/H2O ( 2:3:1 , v/v ) with bath sonication and fractionated over a 2 ml column of DEAE cellulose ( acetate form ) . 
The ﬂow-through fraction was collected . 
Lipids adhering to the column were eluted with eight column volumes each of the solvent CHCl3/MeOH/H2O ( 2:3:1 , v/v ) , in which the aqueous portion contained 0 , 60 , 120 , 240 or 480 mM ammonium acetate . 
Each 2 ml fraction was converted to a two-phase system with the addition of 0.33 ml of CHCl3 and 0.6 ml of water respectively . 
The lower phase was dried under N2 and dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH ( 4:1 v/v ) . 
Equal portions of each fraction were spotted on 10 ¥ 20 cm silica gel 60 TLC plates for chromatographic analysis . 
Fractions containing lipid A species with similar net negative charges were pooled and dried under N2 . 
In all cases , TLC was accomplished on glass-backed silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates in a solvent system consisting of CHCl3/pyridine/88 % formic acid/water ( 50:50:16:5 , v/v ) . 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of lipid A samples
Spectra were acquired in the negative ion linear mode using a Kratos Analytical ( Manchester , UK ) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser , a 20 kV extraction voltage and time-delayed extraction . 
Each spectrum was the average of 50 shots . 
The lipid A samples were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis by depositing 0.3 ml of the sample dissolved in chloroform/methanol ( 4:1 , v/v ) , followed by 0.3 ml of the matrix , which was a mixture of saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50 % acetonitrile and 10 % tribasic ammonium citrate ( 9:1 , v/v ) . 
The sample mixtures were allowed to dry at room temperature before mass analysis . 
Hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4 cents - bis-phosphate from wild-type E. coli ( Sigma ) was used as an external standard for calibration .
