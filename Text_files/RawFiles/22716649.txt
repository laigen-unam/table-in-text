Abstract 
Background : Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium produces surface-associated fimbriae that facilitate adherence of the bacteria to a variety of cells and tissues . 
Type 1 fimbriae with binding specificity to mannose residues are the most commonly found fimbrial type . 
In vitro , static-broth culture favors the growth of S. Typhimurium with type 1 fimbriae , whereas non-type 1 fimbriate bacteria are obtained by culture on solid-agar media . 
Previous studies demonstrated that the phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae is the result of the interaction and cooperation of the regulatory genes fimZ , fimY , fimW , and fimU within the fim gene cluster . 
Genome sequencing revealed a novel gene , stm0551 , located between fimY and fimW that encodes an 11.4-kDa putative phosphodiesterase specific for the bacterial second messenger cyclic-diguanylate monophosphate ( c-di-GMP ) . 
The role of stm0551 in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium remains unclear . 
Results : A stm0551-deleted stain constructed by allelic exchange constitutively produced type 1 fimbriae in both static-broth and solid-agar medium conditions . 
Quantative RT-PCR revealed that expression of the fimbrial major subunit gene , fimA , and one of the regulatory genes , fimZ , were comparably increased in the stm0551-deleted strain compared with those of the parental strain when grown on the solid-agar medium , a condition that normally inhibits expression of type 1 fimbriae . 
Following transformation with a plasmid possessing the coding sequence of stm0551 , expression of fimA and fimZ decreased in the stm0551 mutant strain in both culture conditions , whereas transformation with the control vector pACYC184 relieved this repression . 
A purified STM0551 protein exhibited a phosphodiesterase activity in vitro while a point mutation in the putative EAL domain , substituting glutamic acid ( E ) with alanine ( A ) , of STM0551 or a FimY protein abolished this activity . 
Conclusions : The finding that the stm0551 gene plays a negative regulatory role in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium has not been reported previously . 
The possibility that degradation of c-di-GMP is a key step in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae warrants further investigation .

Background
Salmonella species are some of the most important food-borne pathogens in the world . 
Members of the genus Salmonella are gram-negative , facultative anaerobic rods which are composed of more than 2500 sero-types [ 1 ] . 
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is an important causative agent for gastroenteritis . 
For most bacteria , adhesion to host epi-thelial cells is the first step in establishing an infection . 
Adhesion proteins or hair-like appendages called fimbriae on the outer membranes of bacteria have been implicated in adherence [ 2 ] . 
Whole-genome sequencing identified 13 separate fimbrial gene clusters that may have the potential to encode fimbria-associated proteins in S. Typhimurium [ 3 ] . 
Among these , type-1 fimbriae are the most commonly found type in S. Typhimurium , as in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae [ 4 ] . 
In addition to adherence , type 1 fimbriae also contribute to virulence and biofilm formation [ 5-7 ] . 
Phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhi-murium involves the interaction and cooperation of genes in the fim gene cluster . 
Briefly , FimA , FimI , FimF , and FimH are structural proteins that are incorporated to assemble a fimbrial shaft structure , while FimC and FimD proteins located in the periplasmic space and on the outer membrane respectively , function to transport and anchor the fimbrial proteins . 
FimZ , FimY , FimW , and an arginine transfer RNA fimU , regulate fimbrial production by a complicated network [ 8-12 ] . 
Studies also demonstrated that a global regulator , leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) , and other genes outside the fim gene cluster also take part in the regulatory expression of type-1 fimbriae [ 13,14 ] . 
Bis - ( 3 ′ -- 5 ′ ) - cyclic dimeric GMP ( c-di-GMP ) is a universal second messenger that controls cell surface-associated characters in bacteria [ 15 ] . 
Recent studies revealed the importance of c-di-GMP in regulating many physiological process such as adhesion , biofilm formation , exopolysaccharide synthesis , virulence , and motility [ 16,17 ] . 
The cellular c-di-GMP concentration is regulated by diguanylate cyclase ( DGC ) and phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) . 
DGC cata-lyzes the formation of c-di-GMP through a linear intermediate , pppGpG , while PDE degrades it into guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) . 
The most prominent conserved protein domains in the PDE are EAL and HD-GYP [ 17 ] . 
An open reading frame named stm0551 , located between fimY and fimW , has not previously been investigated to determine its involvement in type-1 fimbrial regulation in S. Typhimurium ( Figure 1 ) . 
The amino acid sequence of the STM0551 protein could encode a putative PDE . 
Multiple alignments of the EAL domain of STM0551 with other known PDE enzymes demonstrated the preservation of several regions throughout the domain sequence > ( Figure 2 ) . 
Since STM 3611 influences curli fimbrial expression in S. 
Typhimurium , and MrkJ controls type 3 fimbriae production and biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae [ 18,19 ] , we decided to investigate whether stm0551 encodes a functional PDE that plays a role in type 1 fimbrial expression . 
In the present study , a stm0551 mutant was constructed by allelic exchange . 
Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of this mutant were analyzed . 
Purified STM0551 protein was tested for its putative function as a PDE in vitro . 
A possible role of stm0551 in type 1 fimbrial regulation in S. Typhimurium is discussed . 
Results
Type 1 fimbrial expression by the S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant strain The bacterial strains and plasmids used were described in Table 1 , while the primers used was indicated in Table 2 . 
The S. Typhimurium stm0551 knockout mutant strain was constructed by a one-step gene inactivation method [ 20 ] . 
Primers stm0551-F and stm0551-R external to stm0551 amplified a 0.5-kb DNA fragment from S. Typhimurium LB5010 genomic DNA , while the same primer set generated a 1.3-kb DNA fragment from gen-omic DNA of the S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant strain , indicating a kanamycin cassette inserted into the stm0551 gene . 
This DNA fragment was also sequenced to determine its identity . 
The confirmed stm0551 mutant strain was then designated S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 . 
S. Typhimurium LB5010 mediated yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte when cultured in static LB broth , whereas agglutination was not detected when cells were collected from LB agar ( Table 3 ) . 
In contrast , the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain mediated agglutination when grown on LB agar . 
Nonetheless the degree of agglutination was not as strong as the same strain grown in static LB broth . 
Transformation of the pSTM0551 plasmid that contains the coding sequence of stm0551 conferred on S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain the ability to inhibit type 1 fimbrial expression in both culture conditions , while the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain carrying a plasmid that possessed a stm0551 coding sequence with the glutamic acid ( E ) at position 49 replaced with an alanine ( A ) , or a pACYC184 cloning vector exhibited the same phenotype as the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain . 
The Figure 3 demonstrated the yeast agglutination tests performed on glass slides . 
Electron microscopy
S. Typhimurium LB5010 prepared in static LB broth culture demonstrated fimbrial appendages on the outermembrane of the cell ( Figure 4 , panel A ) . 
On the contrary , S. Typhimurium LB5010 grown on agar medium did not produce type1 fimbriae ( Figure 4 , pane 
B ) . 
The S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain prepared from static broth medium ( Figure 4 , panel C ) or agar ( Figure 4 , panel D ) produced fimbrial structures . 
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from LB5010 , Δstm0551 , Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) , and Δstm0551 ( pACYC184 ) strains were prepared and analyzed for the fimbrial subunit gene , fimA , and the regulatory genes , fimZ , fimY , and fimW , by quantitative RT-PCR . 
16 S ribosomal ( r ) RNA expression was used as a control . 
Individual gene expression profiles were first normalized against the 16 S rRNA gene and then compared to the expression level of fimA , fimZ , fimY , and fimW obtained from agar . 
As for the parental LB5010 strain , fimA expression obtained from static LB broth was about 150-fold higher than the value obtained from LB agar . 
The fimA expression of the Δstm0551 strain grown on agar was significantly higher than that of LB5010 grown on agar . 
Transformation of Δstm0551 with a plasmid possessing the stm0551 coding sequence repressed fimA expression whether this strain was cultured on agar or in static broth , whereas transformation of the same bacterial strain with the plasmid cloning vector pACYC184 de-repressed fimA expression in both culture conditions ( Figure 5 , panel A ) . 
The fimZ expression levels from different strains demonstrated a similar profile to that observed for fimA . 
The parental LB5010 strain exhibited significant elevated level of fimZ when grown in broth than on agar . 
The fimZ expression of Δstm0551 was higher than that of the parental strain grown on agar . 
Transforming Δstm0551 with pSTM0551 repressed fimZ expression on both culture conditions , while transforming Δstm0551 with pACYC184 cloning vector de-repressed fimZ expression , leading to compar-able level of expression as seen in the Δstm0551 strain ( Figure 5 , panel B ) . 
However , the expression levels of fimY were not significantly different between strains under both growth conditions ( Figure 5 , panel C ) . 
Δstm0551 ( pACYC184 ) had higher fimW expression than Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) did when both strains were culture on agar medium ( Figure 5 , panel D ) . 
PDE activity
Since the predicted amino acid sequence of STM0551 suggested that it was related to a family of proteins that exhibit PDE activity , we determined whether STM0551 possessed PDE activity . 
The in vitro PDE activity of the purified STM0551-His fusion protein was determined using the specific substrate , bis ( pNPP ) . 
The purified FimY-His fusion protein was used as a control since FimY amino acids exhibited no domain related to PDE activity . 
STM0551 possesses `` EVL '' conserved residues that may form the putative active site that varies from the consensus `` EAL '' sequence . 
We constructed a substitution mutation in which the glutamic acid ( E ) at position 49 was replaced by alanine ( A ) in the stm0551 allele . 
A fusion protein of this construct was prepared with the same procedure described for STM0551 and FimY and was designed as STM0551E49A-His . 
The reactions that contained STM0551 exhibited a statistically significant 1.75 fold increase in the release of p-nitrophenol compared to that containing FimY and STM0551E49A ( both reaction mixtures contained the same amount of protein [ 10 μg ] ) ( Figure 6 ) . 
This result suggests that STM0551 could function as a PDE .

The established or postulated functions of the genes are indicated as follows : fimA , major fimbrial subunit ; fimI , minor fimbrial subunit ; fimC , chaperone protein ; fimD , molecular usher ; fimH , adhesion protein ; fimF , minor fimbrial subunit ; fimZ , regulatory protein ; fimY , regulatory protein ; stm0551 , phosphodiesterase ; fimW , regulatory protein ; fimU , arginine tRNA . 
FimZ and FimY are both required to activate fimA . 
FimW represses fimA expression and FimW interacts with FimZ physically to consume FimZ , diminishing available FimZ to activate fimA . 
Leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) activates fimZ . 
fimU activate FimY translation . 
The function of stm0551 within the fim regulatory circuit needs further characterization . 
Discussion
The regulatory pathway of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimur-ium involves several genes including the fim gene cluster and other genes such as lrp [ 8-14 ] . 
The Salmonella patho-genicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) and flagellar systems also crosstalk with type 1 fimbriae [ 23 ] . 
Several studies have indicated that the mechanism controlling the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration plays a critical role in regulating fimbrial production . 
For example , MrkJ , a PDE , regulates type-3 fimbrial production in Klebsiella pneumoniae [ 19 ] . 
Deletion of mrkJ resulted in an increase in type-3 fimbrial production [ 19 ] . 
In Escherichia coli S fimbriae are regulated by a PDE , SfaY [ 24 ] . 
Production of CupA fimbriae of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is controlled by both the GGDEF domain in protein , PA1120 , and PvrR that contains an EAL domain [ 25 ] . 
The FimK of Klebsiella pneumoniae contains the EAL domain and deletion of fimK conferred hyperpiliation of type 1 fimbriae in this bacterium [ 26 ] . 
Our present finding may add one more example to this fimbrial regulation/c-di-GMP concentration circuit . 
The stm0551 gene of S. Typhimurium is located within the fim gene cluster but has not previously been investigated . 
The predicted amino acids of STM0551 showed similarity to those of proteins with PDE activity , so it was interesting to further dissect the function of stm0551 in terms of type 1 fimbrial regulation .

Typhimurium LB5010 , is an LT2 derivative and displays a variable fimbrial phase [ 21 ] . 
A static broth culture favors S. Typhimurium to produce type 1 fimbriae , while nonfimbriae phase bacteria were obtained by growth on solid agar medium [ 27 ] . 
A stm0551 knockout mutant strain constructed in the present study enabled it to produce type 1 fimbriae on the solid LB agar medium . 
This phenotype was correlated with the RT-PCR result that the mRNA expression of the major fimbrial subunit , fimA , was enhanced on solid-agar culture medium . 
These suggested that stm0551 plays a repressive role in type 1 fimbrial regulation perhaps in a similar manner to the role played by FimW in the fim regulatory circuit [ 9 ] . 
The expression of fimA of the transformant Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) grown on agar decreased to the same level as that of the parental LB5010 strain grown in the same conditions . 
However , this transformant did not exhibit visible yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination when grown in static broth , nor did this strain exhibit fimA expression , which was unexpected . 
One of the reasons could have been the relatively high level of STM0551 production due to presence of the multiple copies of the pSTM0551 recombinant plasmid in these cells . 
An excessive STM0551 level in S. Typhimur-ium could presumably cause a dramatically decreased concentration of c-di-GMP locally , and subsequently interfere with fimA expression . 
However , the mechanism by which 
STM0551 interacts with fimA gene expression remains unclear . 
One possibility is that the stm0551 product maintained the local concentration of c-di-GMP at a level such that only a certain amount of c-di-GMP was bound by a hypothetical PilZ domain containing protein . 
This low concentration of c-di-GMP-bound , PilZ domain-containing protein was not able to activate fimA gene expression . 
Disruption of stm0551 increased the local c-di-GMP concentration and consequently also increased the `` functional '' PilZ domain-containing protein to enhance fimA expression . 
The FimY protein of S. Typhimurium could possibly function as such a PilZ domain-containing protein since recently we found that the amino acid sequence of FimY demonstrated relatedness to those of MrkH of K. pneumoniae and YcgR of the E. coli K-12 strain ( data not shown ) . 
Both MrkH and YcgR were shown to be transcriptional activators with c-di-GMP-binding PilZ domains [ 28,29 ] . 
Our hypothesis about the role FimY correlates with the finding that STM0551 did not affect fimY at the transcriptional level ( Figure 5 , panel C ) . 
More detailed study of FimY is necessary to define its role in a possible c-di-GMP regulatory network . 
Both FimY and FimZ are required to activate fimA expression in S. Typhimurium [ 8 ] . 
FimZ is a DNA binding protein that binds the fimA promoter and activate its expression [ 30 ] . 
Our qRT-PCR results demonstrated very similar profiles for both fimA and fim

According to the results reported by Saini et al. , FimY and FimZ independ-ently activate the fimA gene expression , in addition , FimY and FimZ also activated each other 's expression [ 31 ] . 
Inactivation of stm0551 could possibly increase the local concentration of c-di-GMP , which results more c-di-GMP bound FimY ( active form ) available to activate fimZ and fimA , and eventually amplifies the fimA expression . 
FimW is a repressor for fimA in S. Typhimurium . 
FimW may achieve this repressive role by repressing fimY transcription or by protein-protein interaction with FimZ [ 9,31 ] . 
In the present study , little information was obtained regarding how stm0551 may interact with fimW

The purified STM0551 fusion protein possessed the ability to cleave the PDE-specific substrate , bis ( pNPP ) , in vitro , thus confirming the putative phosphodiesterase function assigned to it in the current databank . 
The construct STM0551E49A-His contained a point mutation in which the conserved glutamic acid residue at position 49 within the putative active site was replaced with an alanine residue ; the STM0551E49A mutant protein was unable to cleave bis ( pNPP ) . 
In accordance with this result , when the STM0551E49A-containg construct cloned into a pACYC184 vector ( pSTM0551E49A ) was transformed into Δstm0551 , the resulting transformant exhibited the same phenotype as that of Δstm0551 or Δstm0551 posses-sing pACYC184 cloning vector ( Table 3 ) . 
This further suggested that the glutamic acid at position 49 of STM0551 did play a critical role for phosphodiesterase activity . 
Therefore , the in vivo agglutination phenotype results correlated with the in vitro phosphodiesterase activity result . 
In addition , the purified FimY protein , a positive regulator of type 1 fimbriae , also did not demonstrate such activity . 
Our results indicated that STM0551 has PDE activity in vitro . 
Currently , we can only say that stm0551 takes part in the complicated type 1 fimbrial regulatory network and play a repressive role . 
We have no direct evidence about whether stm0551 actually modulates the concentration of the c-di-GMP pool in S. Typhimurium to achieve its impact on fim gene regulation . 
Although the determination of the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP of Δstm0551 mutants warrants further investigation , this may be prove to be difficult because the c-di-GMP concentration fluctuates locally , due to the spatial compartmentalization of proteins [ 32 ] . 
One example of this phenomenon is that the majority of the c-di-GMP in Acetobacter xylinum is bound by a membrane protein and is released only in response to certain signals [ 33 ] ; therefore we need to take into consideration that the actual and measured concentrations of c-di-GMP might be different . 
Besides fimbrial production , it is interesting to investigate whether stm0551 can influence other phenotypes of S. Typhimurium . 
We tested the ability of bacteria to form biofilm , swimming and swarming motility , and the ability to bind Congo red ( rdar morphotype ) in the LB5010 and Δstm0551strains , but both strains exhibited the same phenotype [ 34,35 ] ( data not shown ) . 
In summary , ou study has suggested for the first time that stm0551 allele which encodes a PDE , play a regulatory role in the production of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium .

Conclusions 
The c-di-GMP pathway is used by most bacteria ( but not eukaryotes or Archaea ) to regulate numerous biological processes [ 36 ] . 
Several lines of evidence have indicated the concentration of c-di-GMP , balanced by diguanylate cyclase ( DGC ) and phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) , account for the fimbrial regulatory network in some microorganisms . 
In S. Typhimurium , it has been demonstrated that production of curli fimbriae was inhibited by a PDE STM3611 [ 18 ] . 
However , no other type of fimbrial expression in this microorganism has thus far been shown to be controlled by DGC or PDE . 
The present study revealed that a previously uncharacterized stm0551 gene , which could encode a PDE , contributes to the down-regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression in S. Typhimurium . 
Our finding may provide valuable information that may help to further elucidate the complicated type 1 fimbrial regulatory circuit in this pathogen . 
Methods
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and culture media The bacterial strains , plasmids , and primers used in the present study are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 . 
The S. Typhimurium strain used was LB5010 , an LT2 derivative [ 21 ] . 
This strain produces type 1 fimbriae and has a variable fimbrial phase . 
Bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Difco/Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) or pla-ted on LB agar . 
When required , media were supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations : 100 μg / ml ampicillin , 50 μg / ml kanamycin , and 20 μg / ml chloramphenicol . 
Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) . 
To detect gene expression , 1 mM of isopropyl-β-D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was used ( MDbio , Taipei , Taiwan ) .

Conclusions 
Construction of a S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant A stm0551 mutant was created by one-step gene inactivation method as described previously [ 20 ] . 
Briefly , a kanamycin-resistance gene from pKD13 tagged with a flanking sequence of the stm0551 gene was generated by a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) technique . 
The designed nucleotide sequence was generated with Pfu polymerase ( Fermentas , St. Leon-Rot , Germany ) on a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 thermal cycler ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) and initially incubated at 94 ° C for 3 min , followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min , 50 °C for 1 min , and 72 °C for 2 min . 
Primers used in this approach are listed in Table 3 . 
Then , the PCR product was introduced by electroporation into S. enterica serotype Typhimurium LB5010 possessing the pKD46 plasmid which expressed λ Red recombinase [ 20 ] . 
All transformants were grown on LB agar containing kanamycin . 
The constructed mutants were verified by PCR with primers located in the flanking sequence of the stm0551 gene

Conclusions 
Yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination test for type 1 fimbriae Tested bacteria were cultured in static LB broth at 37 °C for 48 h or on LB agar at 37 °C overnight . 
Bacterial cells in static-broth medium were collected by centrifugation , and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) . 
Bacteria from LB agar were scraped with a sterile loop and resuspended in 300 μl of 1 × PBS . 
Subsequently , 30 μl of a 3 % ( vol/vol ) suspension of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sigma ) or guinea pig red blood cells in PBS and an equal amount of bacterial cells to be tested were mixed on a glass slide [ 27 ] . 
Visible agglutination after gentle agitation indicated a positive reaction for type 1 fimbriae . 
The presence of mannose-sensitive yeast cell agglutination or mannose-sensitive guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination was determined by mixing the bacterial suspension with PBS containing 3 % ( w/v ) α-methyl-D - mannoside ( Sigma ) . 
Electron microscopy
The bacterial strains tested were grown in static broth or on solid agar and resuspended in 1 × PBS . 
The bacterial cells were then negatively stained with 2 % phosphotungs-tic acid and observed with a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) . 
Complementation test
Primers used for the complementation test ( stm0551-F and stm0551-R ) are listed in Table 2 and were used to amplify genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium LB5010 . 
The PCR product that possessed the full coding sequence of stm0551 was cloned into the pACYC184 vector using T4 DNA ligase ( Fermentas ) . 
To construct a stm0551 allele with the glutamic acid at position 49 replaced with an alanine ; stm0551-F and E49A-TOPO-R were used to amplify the first DNA fragment using Pfu DNA polymerase ( Fermentas ) . 
The PCR conditions were : denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec , 50 °C for 45 sec and 72 °C for 45 sec . 
The second DNA fragment was amplified using E49A-TOPO-F and stm0551-R with the same procedure described above . 
These two DNA fragments were purified by Montage Gel Extraction Kit ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . 
Ligation of these two DNA fragments having two overlapping ends was achieved with stm0551-F and stm0551-R primers as follows : denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min , ligation at 50 °C for 45 sec and elongation at 72 ° C for 45 sec , followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec. , 50 °C for 45 sec , and 72 °C for 45 sec . 
Amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and cloned into pACYC184 vector to generate pSTM0551E49A . 
The mutated stm0551 allele of this plasmid was sequenced to confirm if the glutamic acid ( E ) at position 49 was replaced by alanine ( A ) before transforming into the S. Typhimur-ium Δstm0551 strain by electroporation . 
The pACYC184 cloning vector was also transformed into the S. Typhimur-ium Δstm0551 strain as a control . 
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total bacterial RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Subsequently , RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase ( 1 unit/1 μg RNA ) to remove contaminating genomic DNA . 
The purified RNA was converted to cDNA using a MMLV reverse transcriptase method in the following steps : First , 100 ng of the total RNA was annealed with 100 nM specific primers by heating to 65 °C for 2 min and then cooled on ice for 1 min . 
Next , 1 U of RNasin , 2 μl of 100 mM DTT , 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP and 0.5 μl of 200 U / μl MMLV High Performance Reverse Transcriptase ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) were added to each RNA/primer mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h , followed by heating at 85 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme and then chilled on ice for at least 1 min . 
The specific cDNA that we prepared was used in the following quantitative real-time PCR analysis . 
The components of real-time PCR were prepared by adding 10 ng of each specific cDNA and 1 μl of a 10 mM primer solution to 2 × Maxima SYBR Green / ROX qPCR Master Mix ( Fermentas ) and adjusted with ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μl . 
Cycling conditions were performed using Roche LightCycler 2.0 system ( Roche Applied Science , Branford , CT ) as follows : 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec , 50 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 15 sec . 
Dissociation curves and non-template controls were included to detect any pri-mer dimerization or other artifacts . 
The mRNA transcript levels were obtained by the method described by Livak and Schmittgen [ 37 ] . 
Fusion protein construction
A carboxy terminal 6 × histidine-tagged fusion to STM0551 was constructed by amplifying stm0551 with primers stm0551-TOPO-F and stm0551-TOPO-R using genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium LB5010 as the template . 
The resulting 316-bp PCR product was cloned into the pET101/D-TOPO vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) giving rise to plasmid pSTM0551-His . 
This recombinant plasmid was sequenced at the adjacent portion of the cloning site to make sure it was in frame before subsequent transform-ation step . 
BL21Star ™ ( DE3 ) One ShotW chemically competent E. coli ( Invitrogen ) cells were transformed with pSTM0551-His . 
Log phase cultures were induced to express STM0551-His by adding 1 mM IPTG at 37 °C for 4 hr . 
The STM0551-His fusion protein was further purified by ProBond purification kit ( Invitrogen ) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer . 
The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent ( Fermentas ) [ 38 ] . 
A mutant allele of stm0551 was constructed by site directed mutagenesis using overlapping-extension PCR of S. Typhimurium LB5010 strain genomic DNA template and mutagenic oligonucleotides E49A-TOPO-F and E49A-TOPO-R [ 39 ] . 
Briefly , STM0551-TOPO-F and E49A-TOPO-R were used to amplify the first DNA fragment using Pfu DNA polymerase ( Fermentas ) . 
The PCR conditions were : denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec , 50 °C for 45 sec and 72 °C for 45 sec . 
The second DNA fragment was amplified using E49A-TOPO-F and STM0551-TOPO-R with the same procedure described above . 
These two DNA fragments were purified by Montage Gel Extraction Kit ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . 
Ligation of these two DNA fragments having two overlapping ends was achieved with STM0551-TOPO-F and STM0551-TOPO-R primers as follows : denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min , ligation at 50 °C for 45 sec and elongation at 72 °C for 45 sec , followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec. , 50 °C for 45 sec , and 72 °C for 45 sec . 
Amp-lified fragments were cloned into pET101/D-TOPO vector and sequenced to determine if the glutamic acid ( E ) at pos-ition 49 was replaced by alanine ( A ) . 
The resulting recombinant plasmid was designed as pSTM0551E49A-His . 
Further protein induction and purification were performed using the same procedure as for STM0551-His fusion protein . 
Similarly FimY-His fusion protein was constructed using fimY-TOPO-F and fimY-TOPO-R primers .
