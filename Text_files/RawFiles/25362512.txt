Abstract Salmonella , a genus that is closely related to Escherichia coli , includes many pathogens of humans and other animals . 
A notable feature that distinguishes Salmo-nella from E. coli is lactose negativity , because the lac operon is lost in most Salmonella genomes . 
Here , we expressed the lac operon in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and compared the virulence of the Lac ? 
strain to that of the wild-type strain in a murine model , invasion assays , and macrophage replication assays . 
We showed that the Lac strain is attenuated in vivo and the ? 
attenuation of virulence is caused by its defect in epithelial cell invasion . 
However , the invasion-defective phenotype is unrelated to lactose utilization . 
Through sequencing and the comparison of the transcriptome proﬁle between the Lac and wild-type strains during invasion , we found that ? 
most ﬂagellar genes were markedly downregulated in the 
Lac strain , while other genes associated with invasion , ? 
such as the majority of genes encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 , were not differentially expressed . 
Moreover , we discovered that lacA is the major repressor of ﬂagellar gene expression in the lac operon . 
In conclusion , these data demonstrate that the lac operon decreases Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells through repression of ﬂagellar biosynthesis . 
As the ability to invade epithelial cells is a critical virulence determinant of Salmonella , our results provide important evidence that the loss of the lac operon contributes to the evolution of Salmonella pathogenicity . 
Introduction
Salmonella are important enteropathogenic bacteria that are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor with Escherichia coli about 100 million years ago [ 9 ] . 
Two species were included in the Salmonella genus : S. enterica and S. bongori , and S. bongori represents a phylogenetically older separation from the genus Salmonella [ 1 , 4 ] . 
S. enterica is comprised of six subspecies and further divided into more than 2,500 serovars [ 21 ] . 
Most of the serovars that cause disease in humans and other mammals belong to subspecies I , while S. bongori and S. enterica subspecies II , IIIa , IIIb , IV , VI , and VII are mostly found in cold-blooded animals [ 3 , 7 , 32 ] . 
The two hallmarks of Salmonella pathogenesis are the invasion of non-phagocytic cells , such as epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa , and the survival and replication inside infected phagocytic cells [ 17 ] . 
Salmonella virulence evolution has been generally attributed to the horizontal acquirement of different virulence elements , such as

Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPIs ) , bacteriophages , and plasmids [ 25 , 33 ] . 
SPI-1 and SPI-2 represent two of the most important virulence elements . 
SPI-1 is present in both S. bongori and S. enterica and is required for bacterial invasion of the intestinal epithelium . 
Whereas , SPI-2 is present only in S. enterica and is essential for bacterial replication within macrophages [ 15 , 25 ] . 
Besides the acquirement of virulence elements , the evolution of Salmonella has also been shaped by gene loss [ 5 , 28 , 29 ] . 
An average of 25 % of genes are absent in S. enterica compared with E. coli K-12 [ 27 ] . 
It is possible that gene loss contributes to the early divergence of Salmonella from E. coli , because the expression of the newly acquired virulence factors ( e.g. , SPI-1 and SPI-2 ) may be hindered by some ancestral traits that had been already present in bacteria . 
Although such issues are not currently well deﬁned in Salmonella , it has been well recognized in Shi-gella , which is another close relative of E. coli and a wellknown enteric pathogen [ 35 ] . 
Shigella evolution prominently exempliﬁes the inactivation of the so-called `` antivirulence genes '' that are present in various nonpathogenic E. coli strains , such as cadA and ompT [ 26 , 30 ] . 
Lactose fermentation is a classic experiment that distinguishes Salmonella from E. coli , because most Salmo-nella strains can not ferment lactose . 
Lactose utilization in E. coli is mediated by the lac operon , which consists of three structural genes ( lacZ , lacY , and lacA ) that encode bgalactosidase , lactose permease , and transacetylase , respectively . 
LacZ and LacY , which are responsible for the cleavage of lactose into glucose and galactose and the transportation of lactose into the cell , respectively , are necessary for lactose catabolism . 
LacA is responsible for the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the 6-hydroxyl of some galactopyranosides . 
A regulatory gene lacI that is located adjacent to lacZYA encodes the lac repressor regulating the transcription of the lac operon . 
In S. enterica , the lac region , including the lac operon and lacI , has been completely lost , whereas , in S. bongori , homolog genes of lacI and lacZ are still present in the genome [ 12 ] . 
It has been demonstrated that the loss of lacI in S. enterica contributes to its virulence evolution , because LacI interferes with the expression of SPI-2 genes [ 10 ] . 
Considering that the complete or partial loss of the lac operon in the Salmonella genus is more widespread than the loss of LacI , it is possible that the loss of the ability to utilize lactose in S. bongori and S. enterica contributed to the early divergence of Salmonella from E. coli . 
In the current study , we investigated the signiﬁcance of the loss of the lac operon to Salmonella pathogenicity . 
We expressed the lac operon in S. Typhimurium 14028 and compared the virulence between the Lac strain and wild - ? 
type strain . 
Our results showed that the Lac strain was ? 
attenuated in vivo and defective in epithelial cell invasion . 
As bacterial invasion of epithelial cells of the gastrointes-tinal mucosa is an essential step in the pathogenesis of Salmonella [ 6 , 24 ] , we propose that the loss of the lac operon has contributed to the evolution of Salmonella to be pathogens . 
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Primers used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S1 . 
S. Typhimurium strain 14028 was used as wild-type Salmonella strain throughout this study . 
LB broth and agar plates were used for growth and maintenance of bacterial strains . 
RPMI-1640 medium ( Gibco ; a lactose-free medium ) supplemented with 10 mM lactose was used for growth of bacterial strains during the process of invasion and intracellular replication assays . 
Moreover , RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with different concentrations of lactose ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 , 60 , and 100 ) or without lactose ( 0 mM ) was used for testing effects of lactose utilization on Salmonella virulence . 
When required , medium was supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations : ampicillin 100 lg/mL , kanamycin 50 lg/mL , chloramphenicol 15 lg/mL , and gentamicin 10 or 50 lg/mL . 
To generate plasmids to constitutively express the lac operon or LacZ/Y/A / I in S. Typhimurium 14028 , the lowcopy expression vector pACYC184 was used . 
The lac promoter sequence of E. coli K12 MG1655 was ﬁrstly ligated into pACYC184 to generate the plasmid pYM , so the expression of the lac operon or LacZ/Y/A in S. Typhimurium 14028 were all under the control of lac promoter . 
LacI expression in 14028 was also under the control of its native promoter by inserting both lacI promoter and lacI gene sequence to pACYC184 . 
Plasmid pYM-LacZYA , pYM-LacZ , pYM-LacY , pYM-LacA , and pACYC-LacI were generated from pYM or pACYC184 by Red/ET Recombination as previously described by Zhang et al. [ 38 , 39 ] . 
Brieﬂy , a linear DNA fragment carrying a chlor-amphenicol-resistance ( cat ) gene ﬂanked by two oligonucleotide homology arms of the chosen target DNA , was PCR ampliﬁed from the plasmid pYM or pACYC184 . 
Next , the linear fragment was electroporated into E. coli K12 MG1655 to clone the target DNA region by homologous recombination and then to generate plasmid pYMLacZYA , pYM-LacZ , pYM-LacY , pYM-LacA , and pA-CYC-LacI , respectively . 
Thereafter , these plasmids were transformed into S. Typhimurium strain 14028 to generate strains Lac , LacZ , LacY , LacA , and LacI , respec - ? ? ? ? ? 
tively . 
All constructs were veriﬁed by PCR and DNA sequencing . 
Additionally , the expression of the lac operon in 14028 was conﬁrmed by the lactose fermentation experiment , which showed that the Lac strain can use ? 
lactose as its sole carbon source , implying the expression of lac genes under the lac promoter in 14028 . 
Further , we conﬁrmed the expression of lac genes in 14028 by Quantitative real-time PCR analysis ( see Supplementary Fig . 
S1 ) .

Mice experiments were conducted according to the principles outlined by the National Research Council ( US ) . 
Overnight bacterial cultures were serially diluted to suitable colony forming unit ( CFU ) / ml in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) for infection . 
Six - to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intragastrically with 1 9 10 CFUs 6 of wild-type 14028 or Lac strains . 
The survival of the ? 
infected mice was monitored for up to 28 days and the survival rate values were recorded . 
For competitive index ( CI ) infection experiments , mice were infected orally with mixed inoculum containing the wild-type 14028 and Lac ? 
strains . 
Mice were sacriﬁced after 3 days post-infection . 
Spleen and liver were homogenized , diluted , and then plated on LB plates for determination of total CFUs .

output input 
The invasion assays were performed as previously descri-bed by Isberg and Falkow [ 18 ] . 
HeLa cells ( ATCC CCL2 ) were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates with a den-5 sity of 1 9 10 per/well 2 days before infection . 
Cultures of different Salmonella strains grown to mid-log phase were added to HeLa cells monolayers at the multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 . 
After 1 h of incubation followed by the addition of gentamicin ( 50 mg/mL ) to kill extracellular bacteria , intracellular bacteria were quantiﬁed to determine the level of invasion . 
The invasion rate was calculated based on recovered intracellular bacteria relative to the input . 
Experiments were repeated three times .

Replication of bacterial strains in macrophages was performed as previously described [ 36 ] . 
Cultures of different Salmonella strains grown to mid-log phase were added to murine RAW264 .7 macrophage cells ( ATCC TIB 71 ) at a MOI of 10 . 
After incubation at 37 C for 30 min , infected cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS ; then RPMI-1640 medium containing 50 lg/mL of gentamicin was added to kill non-invasive bacterial cells .

Lac Strain is Attenuated in the Murine Model
We examined the effect of the lac operon on S. Typhimurium virulence in a murine model . 
BALB/c mice were inoculated intragastrically with approximately 6 ? 
1 9 10 CFUs of wild-type 14028 or Lac strains and monitored for survival over a 28-day period . 
As shown in Fig. 1a , all the mice infected with the wild-type strain were dead by day 12 of infection , while only 30 % of the mice ? 
infected with Lac strain had died by day 12 . 
Surprisingly , 50 % of the mice infected with Lac strain survived after ? 
28 days of infection . 
Furthermore , the LD50 for the Lac ? 
strain ( 4.6 9 10 ) was 11-fold higher compared with the 7 wild-type strain ( 4.2 9 10 ) . 
Additionally , we compared 6 the bacterial load of the wild-type and Lac strains in the ? 
spleen and liver of infected mice after 3 days using the CI approach . 
We observed that the mean CI for the Lac ? 
strain relative to wild-type strain was 0.29 for spleen and 0.36 for liver ( P \ 0.05 ; Fig. 1b ) , indicating the survival ability of wild-type strain in spleen or liver is 3 -- 4-fold higher than that of the Lac strain . 
These results collec - ? 
tively demonstrated that the Lac strain is attenuated in the ? 
murine model . 
Lac Strain is Defective in Epithelial Cell Invasion 1
To investigate how the lac operon attenuates S. Typhimurium virulence , we tested the effect of the lac operon on the ability of S. Typhimurium to invade HeLa epithelial cells and to replicate in murine RAW264 .7 macrophages . 
The Lac strain showed a signiﬁcantly decreased ability to ? 
invade HeLa cells compared with the wild-type strain ( [ 10-fold ; Fig. 2a ) . 
In contrast , the replication of Lac ? 
strain in macrophages was comparable to that of the wildtype strain ( Fig. 2b ) . 
The ability of Salmonella strains to invade HeLa cells in vitro can reﬂect their capacity to invade intestinal mucosa in vivo [ 13 ] . 
Collectively , this result demonstrates that the lac operon attenuates S. Typhimurium virulence by decreasing bacterial invasion of epithelial cells . 
Invasion-Defective Phenotype of the Lac Strain is 1 Unrelated to Lactose Utilization
We sought to understand how the lac operon inﬂuenced the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and to investigate whether the ability to utilize lactose in the Lac strain is ? 
responsible for its invasion defect . 
To address this issue , we supplemented RPMI-1640 medium with different concentrations of lactose ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 , 60 , and 100 ) and examined the invasion ability of the Lac strain to HeLa ? 
cells under these conditions . 
We showed that in all these media , the Lac strain exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in ? 
invasion ability compared with the wild-type strain ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Furthermore , the data indicate that the invasiondefective phenotype of the Lac strain is unrelated to its ? 
lactose utilization ability , as the Lac strain showed ? 
comparable invasion ability to HeLa cells in media with different concentrations of lactose , even in medium without lactose ( Fig. 3 ) .

Lac Operon Inhibits the Transcription of Most Flagellar Genes During Invasion
We performed transcriptome sequencing and compared the transcriptome proﬁles between Lac strain and wild-type ? 
strain at their invasion stage to HeLa cells . 
We observed 156 upregulated genes and 96 downregulated genes in the Lac strain during invasion compared with the wild-type ? 
values were shown for the spleen and liver . 
Mice were inoculated intragastrically with a 1:1 mixed inoculum of wild-type 14028 and Lac strains and were sacriﬁced after 3 days . 
The data represent ? 
results from three independent experiments . 
Student 's t test was used to calculate P value to RAW264 .7 macrophages at a MOI of 10 . 
Fold intracellular multiplication was calculated by dividing the intracellular bacterial load at 4 , 8 , and 24 h by the intracellular bacterial load at 2 h.The data from each graph represents the average of three independent experiments .

* P \ 0.05 , ** P \ 0.01 strain ( [ 2-fold and P \ 0.05 ; see Supplementary Table S2 ) . 
The upregulated genes include : genes involved in the transport of galactose , gluconate , and arginine ; genes involved in the biosynthesis of Heme O and arginine ; 3 SPI-2 genes ( ssaGJR ) ; as well as 85 hypothetical genes and genes of undeﬁned function . 
The downregulated gene include : gene involved in the ﬂagellar biosynthesis and the synthesis of hydrogenase III ; genes involved in the transport of mannose , protoheme IX , and lysine ; as well as 35 hypothetical genes and genes of undeﬁned function . 
The transcriptome data indicate some metabolic differences between the Lac strain and the wild-type strain during ? 
invasion . 
Among the differentially regulated genes , we looked for the genes that were associated with bacterial invasion . 
Interestingly , most ﬂagellar genes were found to be signiﬁcantly downregulated in the Lac background ? 
( Table 2 ) . 
For example , the ﬂiC ( encoding the phase-1 ﬂagellin ) and ﬂjB ( encoding the phase-2 ﬂagellin ) genes were downregulated 3.8 - and 2.3-fold , respectively ; and the ﬂhD and ﬂhC genes that encode the two master ﬂagellar regulators were downregulated 4.5 and 6.0-fold , respectively . 
In addition , we conﬁrmed the downregulation of these ﬂagellar genes by qRT-PCR ( see Supplementary Fig . 
S2 ) . 
It is well recognized that ﬂagella contribute to the full invasive potential of Salmonella to the intestinal epithelial cells [ 19 , 20 , 31 , 34 ] . 
Thus , our data show that the inva-sion-defective phenotype of the Lac strain unequivocally ? 
correlated with its repression of ﬂagellar genes . 
In contrast , the transcription of other genes involved in invasion , such as most SPI-1 genes and genes involved in chemotaxis system ( cheAWMR ) , were not signiﬁcantly altered in the Lac strain . 
Thus , we conclude that the lac operon ? 
decreases bacterial invasion of epithelial cells through repression of ﬂagellar genes .

LacA is the Major Repressor of Flagellar Gene Expression in the Lac Operon
To investigate which gene in the lac operon inhibits ﬂa-gellar gene expression , we expressed LacZ , LacY , and LacA in the S. Typhimurium strain 14028 , respectively , and investigated the transcription of the four major ﬂagellar genes ( ﬂiC , ﬂjB , ﬂhD , and ﬂhC ) in these strains during invasion . 
The abundance of the transcripts in each strain was determined by qRT-PCR . 
Surprisingly , we observed negligible change in ﬂagellar gene expression caused by lacZ and lacY . 
However , lacA signiﬁcantly inhibited the transcription of the four genes , and the inhibition is comparable to that of the lac operon ( Fig. 4 ) . 
This result indicates that lacA represses ﬂagellar gene expression in the lac operon , whereas the underlying mechanism is unknown and needs further study .

Discussion
In this study , we show that the expression of the lac operon attenuates S. Typhimurium in vivo and inhibits its invasion of epithelial cells . 
We demonstrate that the invasion - ? 
defective phenotype of the Lac strain is caused by ﬂa-gellar synthesis repression . 
These ﬁndings establish that the loss of the lac operon is an important step during the evolution of Salmonella pathogenicity , and is positively selected by Salmonella virulence . 
The mechanisms by which lacA inhibits ﬂagellar gene expression are uncertain . 
LacA is known to encode a bgalactoside transacetylase , which transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to b-galactosides . 
Protein acetylation has been demonstrated to be associated with regulation of cellular metabolism , cellular resistance to stress , and bacterial pathogenicity in many previous studies [ 2 , 14 , 16 , 23 , 37 ] . 
We propose LacA can also transfer acetyl groups to some regulators of ﬂagellar genes , which can modify the activities of these regulators and result in ﬂagellar synthesis repression . 
Besides , it is also possible that lacA gene can works as DNA element to regulate the ﬂagella synthesis . 
However , further studies are needed to conﬁrm these hypotheses . 
lacZ and lacY are necessary for lactose catabolism , whereas the expression of these genes did not affect ﬂagellar gene expression . 
This result is consistent with the fact that the invasion-defective phenotype of the Lac strain is unrelated to lactose utilization . 
Thus , we can ? 
also suggest that the presence of lacZ in S. bongori do not inﬂuence its pathogenicity in cold-blooded animals . 
Moreover , we propose that the loss of lac operon ( primarily lacA ) may play a more signiﬁcant role than the loss of LacI in the evolution of Salmonella . 
Although the pre-sence of LacI attenuated Salmonella virulence in vivo , it mainly affects bacterial replication in macrophages [ 10 ] . 
We demonstrated in this study that the presence of LacI in S. Typhimurium 14028 did not inﬂuence bacterial invasion of epithelial cells ( see Supplementary Fig . 
S3 ) . 
In contrast , the presence of the lac operon inﬂuences bacterial invasion of epithelial cells , which is the critical ﬁrst step in Sal-monella pathogenesis [ 6 , 11 , 24 ] . 
It is well-known that most Salmonella serovars are non-typhoidal Salmonella , which restrict their lifestyle in the intestinal tract , and lack the ability to replicate in host macrophages [ 8 , 22 ] . 
Thus , loss of the lac operon which can increase bacterial invasion of epithelial cells is essential for almost all Salmonella serovars . 
In comparison , the loss of lacI seems not necessary for the pathogenicity of the large number of nontyphoidal Salmonella . 
In conclusion , our results suggest that the loss of the lac operon contributes to the virulence evolution of Salmonella by increasing bacterial invasion of epithelial cells . 
Because invasion of epithelial cells is the ﬁrst hallmark of Salmo-nella virulence [ 6 , 11 , 24 ] , we suggest that the loss of the lac operon may have facilitated the ﬁrst step of Salmonella evolution as pathogens .
