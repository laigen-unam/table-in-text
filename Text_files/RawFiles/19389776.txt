In order to survive in the host and initiate infection , Salmonella enterica needs to undergo a transition between aerobic and anaerobic growth by modulating its central metabolic pathways . 
In this study , a comparative analysis of the proteome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in the presence or absence of oxygen was performed . 
The most prominent changes in expression were 
measured in a semiquantitative manner using difference in-gel electrophoresis ( DIGE ) to reveal the main protein factors involved in the adaptive response to anaerobiosis . 
A total of 38 proteins were found to be induced anaerobically , while 42 were repressed . 
The proteins of interest were in-gel digested with trypsin and identified by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry using peptide mass 
fingerprinting . 
In the absence of oxygen , many fermentative enzymes catalysing reactions in the mixed-acid or arginine fermentations were overexpressed . 
In addition , the enzyme fumarate reductase , which is known to provide an alternative electron acceptor for the respiratory chains in the absence of oxygen , was shown to be induced . 
Increases in expression of several glycolytic 
and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes , as well as two malic enzymes , were detected , suggesting important roles for these in anaerobic metabolism . 
Substantial decreases in expression were observed for a large number of periplasmic transport proteins . 
The majority of these are involved in the uptake of amino acids and peptides , but permeases transporting iron ,

INTRODUCTION 
Salmonella enterica is one of the most characterized pathogens and is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis ( Darwin & Miller , 1999 ) . 
The first critical step of infection takes place in the gastrointestinal tract , where oxygen , required for respiration and energy generation , is in limited supply . 
Salmonella initiates infection in the intestinal epithelium by inducing destruction of M cells and neighbouring enterocytes and allowing free access of the bacterial cells to the lamina propria . 
After passing through the M cells , the infection is limited to gastroenteritis if the strain is unable to survive in the host lymphatic system ( Jones et al. , 1994 ) but , regardless of the type of infection established in the host , the invasion of the intestinal epithelium is a critical first step that takes place in an anaerobic environment . 
It has been demonstrated that anaerobically grown S. enterica is more invasive and adheres better to mammalian cells than aerobically grown or stationary-phase cells ( Lee & Falkow , 1990 ) . 
Therefore , the mechanisms that control the adaptation of growth in anoxic environments may also play an important role in the virulence of this species ( Fink et al. , 2007 ) . 
S. enterica is a facultative anaerobe and it thrives in an anaerobic environment by performing fermentations and / or by using alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate or fumarate . 
In the closely related Escherichia coli , expression of the anaerobic respiratory pathway genes for fumarate reductase ( frdABCD ) , nitrate reductase ( narGHJI ) and DMSO reductase ( dmsABC ) is upregulated in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate availability ( Stewart , 1982 ; Jones &

Gunsalus , 1987 ; Gunsalus , 1992 ) . 
Nitrate is the preferred exogenous electron acceptor due to its higher redox potential . 
Therefore , during anaerobic cell growth , the expression of narGHJI is elevated when nitrate is present , while the expression of the frdABCD operon is decreased until nitrate is depleted or absent from the medium ( Gunsalus , 1992 ) . 
Another key enzyme of the anaerobic metabolism is pyruvate formate lyase ( PFL ) , which catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate by a non-oxidative mechanism , thus providing the main substrate for the mixed-acid fermentations . 
PFL is transcribed from eight different promoters in E. coli and has been shown to increase 12 - to 15-fold under anaerobiosis ( Sawers & Suppmann , 1992 ) . 
The complex regulation of these , as well as many other cellular processes associated with the transition to anoxic environments , has been studied in detail in E. coli . 
The activity of more than 70 genes involved in the adaptation to anaerobiosis is under the control of the DNA-binding protein FNR ( fumarate-nitrate reduction ) ( Lynch & Lin , 1996 ) . 
FNR responds to fluctuation in the oxygen concentration by inducing/repressing various proteins . 
FNR functions alone or in synchronization with other regulators such as ArcA , RpoS , NarL , Fur or SoxR ( Spiro & Guest , 1991 ; Hassan & Sun , 1992 ; Gunsalus & Park , 1994 ; Schröder et al. , 1994 ; Park & Gunsalus , 1995 ) . 
The homologous gene in S. enterica has also been identified , by a mutation that affects the expression of endopeptidase T , and has been designated oxrA ( Strauch et al. , 1985 ) . 
The oxrA/FNR modulon has been characterized in the virulent strain of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( ATCC 14028s ) and the results indicate that , similarly to E. coli , it encompasses the main metabolic and energy pathways as well as motility . 
However , several Salmonella-specific operons were also identified ( Fink et al. , 2007 ) . 
The same study has also demonstrated a role of oxrA/FNR in the regulation of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) and the oxrA mutant was shown to be attenuated in vivo ( Fink et al. , 2007 ) . 
Although FNR is the main regulator of the adaptive response of S. enetrica to the lack of oxygen , many proteins are under the control of more than one transcriptional regulator . 
One example is the enzyme Mn - binding 2 + superoxide dismutase ( SodA ) , which is under the control of six different regulators ( Compan & Touati , 1993 ) . 
Thus the regulatory networks that facilitate the transition from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment are extremely complex , and their coordinated expression is yet to be elucidated . 
Previously , the proteome of S. enterica was characterized using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2D GE ) , revealing a dramatic transformation in the expression pattern with the shift to anaerobiosis ( Spector et al. , 1986 ) . 
However , the study was performed before the general availability of protein identification methods , and the identities of the proteins with changing expression were not determined . 
The work presented here is the first step towards the detailed characterization of the proteome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in conditions resembling those at the site of infection . 
By using a proteomic approach , the changes in expression of many gene products were monitored simultaneously , revealing what protein factors play a key role in the transition from aerobic to anaerobic environments . 
The degree of change of known metabolic enzymes as well as additional proteins that are not part of the FNR or ArcA modulons was measured . 
The level of variability in the adaptive response to anaerobiosis between two different isolates of serovar Typhimurium was also compared . 
METHODS
All materials were obtained from GE Healthcare , UK , unless otherwise specified . 
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
Two isolates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium were used in this study : an NCTC reference isolate ( 74 ) and a clinical isolate obtained from VLA Weybridge ( 204 ) . 
Bacterial cultures were maintained on nutrient broth . 
Anaerobic conditions were generated by completely filling glass vials with medium and incubating them statically at 37 uC , in tightly closed cylinders together with anaerobic sachets ( Oxoid ) , to ensure an entirely anoxic environment . 
Fully aerobic conditions were created by growing the cultures in 10 ml volumes ( in 50 ml flasks ) with constant agitation ( 250 r.p.m. ) on a horizontal rotary shaker . 
The growth phases were monitored , and stationary phase was defined when the OD600 values of the cultures stopped increasing exponentially . 
Cells were collected at late exponential phase ( OD600 of 1.8 for aerobic and 0.6 for anaerobic growth ) . 
Growth curves of both isolates in aerobic and anaerobic conditions are presented in Supplementary Fig . 
S1 , available with the online version of this paper . 
Sample preparation and labelling . 
For the preparation of crude cell lysates , bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min , and washed three times with TE buffer ( Sigma ) . 
The washed pellets were resuspended in lysis solution ( 7 M urea , 2 M thiourea , 4 % CHAPS , 20 mM Tris ) and homogenized using glass beads . 
Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 21 000 g for 30 min , at 4 uC . 
The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein assay as described by the manufacturer . 
The protein extracts were further purified by precipitation using the 2D clean-up kit and resuspended in lysis solution ( see above ) . 
The pH of the samples was adjusted to 8 , the concentration was set at 6 mg 21 ml and a total of 50 mg protein was used for labelling . 
Four different batches of isolates 204 and 74 were used to prepare four replicate extracts ( biological replicates ) for each treatment . 
The pooled standard was prepared by mixing equal amounts of all samples , and dispensing them in 50 mg aliquots prior to labelling . 
Cyanine dyes ( Cy3 and Cy5 ) were reconstituted in 99.8 % anhydrous N,N9-dimethylformamide ( DMF ; Sigma ) and added to the labelling reactions in a ratio of 400 pmol dye : 50 mg protein . 
Protein labelling was performed in the dark , for 30 min at 4 uC . 
The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mM lysine ( 1 ml per 400 pmol dye ) followed by incubation on ice for 10 min . 
Two dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2D GE ) . 
The Cy3-labelled protein samples were mixed with the Cy5-labelled pooled standard and added to 26 sample buffer ( 7 M urea , 2 M thiourea , 4 % CHAPS , 130 mM DTT , 2 % Ampholines 4 -- 7 ) to a total volume of 400 ml and loaded into 18 cm IPG strips ( pH 4 -- 7 ) , by the in-gel rehydration method ( Rabilloud et al. , 1994 ) . 
IEF was performed using an IPGphor apparatus for 24 h , 120 kV h , at 20 uC . 
The focused IPG strips were equilibrated twice ( 2620 min ) in DTT and iodoaceta-mide as described by Görg et al. ( 2004 ) . 
Second-dimension electrophoresis was performed on 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels using the Ettan DALT Twelve apparatus . 
Gels were run at 1 W per gel for 1 h , and at 5 W per gel for 18 h , at 25 uC , until the bromophenol blue dye front had run off the bottom of the gels . 
Image acquisition and data analysis . 
Labelled proteins were visualized using the Typhoon Imager using a 532 nm laser and 580 nm emission filter for Cy3 , and 630 nm laser and 670 nm emission filter for Cy5 . 
All gels were scanned at 100 mm resolution and cropped to remove extraneous areas using ImageQuant V5 .0 . 
The cropped images were converted to 16 bit TIF files and processed using the DeCyder software V 5.0 . 
After image analysis , which included spot co-detection , quantification and Student 's t-test , the spots that showed a significant change in expression ( P ,0.01 ) were selected for further analysis . 
The spots of interest were excised from preparative gels , run separately and stained with SYPRO Ruby . 
The preparative and analytical images were matched using the DeCyder software . 
In-gel digestion with trypsin . 
Protein spots were excised from the gels manually and cut into small pieces . 
The gel pieces were destained in 100 mM NH4HCO3 ( Sigma ) in 50 % acetonitrile ( Sigma ) for 30 min at 37 uC , dehydrated in acetonitrile and reduced with 10 mM DTT in 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 60 min at 56 uC . 
This was followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide ( IAA ) in the dark for 45 min . 
The gel pieces were dried in a Speed Vac ( Savant ) and in-gel digested with trypsin in 25 mM NH HCO ( 20 -- 40 ml of 12 ng trypsin 4 3 ml per digest , Promega ) at 37 21 uC for 16 h . 
After digestion , the resulting peptides were collected and the gel pieces were washed twice with 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) to extract additional peptides . 
The peptides were desalted and concentrated using ZipTip C18 pipette tips ( Millipore ) . 
MS analysis . 
Prior to MALDI TOF analysis , 0.7 ml of the digest was co-crystallized ( dry-droplet method ) on the target plate with 0.7 ml of matrix solution ( 10 mg CHCA ml in 45 % acetonitrile , 45 % 21 ethanol in 0.1 % TFA ) . 
Tryptic peptides were measured with a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer ( Waters ) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser . 
Analysis was performed in positive-ion mode using a reflecting analyser with the voltage set at 2000 V. Peptide masses were collected over a m/z range of 800 -- 3000 Da . 
The data were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBInr ) , using the MASCOT software available online ( http://www.matrixscien-ce.com ) . 
One missed cleavage per peptide was allowed , and a mass tolerance of 100 p.p.m. was used in all searches . 
As a fixed modification , carbamydomethylation of cysteine was specified , and as a variable modification , methionine was assumed to be oxidized . 
No taxonomic , mass or pI constraints were applied . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The most prominent expression changes observed in the proteome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium after a shift from aerobic to anaerobic growth were quantified here . 
For the analysis of the soluble cytosolic fraction of the proteome we chose the ` classical ' combination of difference in-gel electrophoresis ( DIGE ) and peptide mass fingerprinting ( PMF ) . 
A pH gradient of 4 -- 7 was chosen for the separation of the protein extracts based on our previous observation that the majority of the detectable cytosolic proteins of Salmonella focus in this pH range ( Encheva et al. , 2007 ) . 
The adaptive response to anaerobiosis was assessed using two different isolates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium obtained from unrelated sources ( see Methods ) . 
Each isolate was analysed in four biological replicates , prepared independently in separate experiments . 
A total of 16 sample gels labelled with Cy5 and 16 pooled standard gels labelled with Cy3 were used for the analysis with the DeCyder software . 
Expression differences of twofold or more were considered significant for spots detected in at least 75 % of the gels ( as described by Karp et al. , 2004 ) . 
The spots of interest were manually excised from the 2D gels counterstained with Colloidal G ( Sigma ) and identified using PMF . 
Each spot was identified from two duplicate digests prepared independently from different 2D gels . 
To confirm the spot matching between different isolates as well as to increase the confidence of the identifications , the spots were excised from both 74 and 204 gels ( where possible ) . 
The searches were performed using MASCOT 1.8 software against the NCBInr database . 
The identified proteins with corresponding MOWSE scores , peptide coverage and number of matched peptides are presented in Supplementary Table S1 . 
From the selected protein spots only three spots with increased expression and two spots with decreased expression could not be identified . 
For positive identification , a MOWSE score of at least 70 was required and a minimum of six peptides or 25 % sequence coverage . 
However , for most of the protein spots considerably better identification was achieved [ MOWSE scores above 100 , sequence coverage above 35 % and more than 12 peptides per protein ( Supplementary Table S1 ) ] . 
The comparative analysis of aerobically and anaerobically grown S. enterica showed a marked transformation in the protein profiles of both strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Casual visual assessment showed that many of the abundant proteins which were present aerobically were barely detectable anaerobically and vice versa . 
Generally the two isolates altered their expression in a similar manner but further quantitative analysis also revealed several strain-specific changes . 
A total of 80 protein spots representing 65 proteins showed significant change in expression under anaerobic conditions . 
Of these , 38 showed an increase and 42 showed a decrease in expression ( Table 1 ) . 
A large number of proteins were present in more than one isoform on the gels . 
The presence of such isoforms can be indicative of post-translational modifications or a result of sample preparation ( Lutter et al. , 2001 ; Löster & Kannicht , 2008 ) . 
In some cases , e.g. ornithine carbamoyltransferase , aspartate ammonia lyase , all isoforms showed similar expression changes in the absence of oxygen . 
However , some of the transport proteins , e.g. dipeptide-binding protein and oligopeptide-binding protein , showed expression change in only one of several isoforms . 
The enzyme malate dehydrogenase was detected as two isoforms , one of which was overexpressed aerobically while the other was overexpressed anaerobically . 
Overall , the most affected functional groups were transport proteins and fermentative enzymes , followed by other metabolic enzymes , stress-response proteins and chaperones , and hypothetical proteins . 
Proteins with elevated levels of expression in the absence of oxygen 
Metabolic enzymes . 
A variety of pathways for carbon and electron flow are differentially expressed in enteric bacteria depending on whether molecular oxygen is present in the environment ( Gunsalus & Park , 1994 ) . 
Under anaerobic conditions , fumarate reductase ( FrdA ) is known to provide an anaerobic respiratory pathway as well as replace succinate dehydrogenase to allow reductive production of succinyl-CoA ( Jones & Gunsalus , 1987 ) . 
The elevated expression of FrdA under anaerobiosis is well documented and was also observed in this study . 
The enzyme was identified as two isoforms , both of which were overexpressed anaerobically more than 20-fold in both isolates ( see Table 1 ) . 
Although it has been clearly demonstrated that FrdA is regulated by FNR in E. coli , there has been no experimental evidence to confirm this in S. enterica , suggesting that the FNR regulon of S. enterica has not been fully characterized ( Gunsalus & Park , 1994 ; Salmon et al. , 2003 ) . 
Other electron acceptors such as nitrate , nitrite and DMSO are known to be used preferentially to fumarate , but no change in expression of the corresponding oxidoreductases NarGHJI , NirB or

DmsABC was observed . 
It is worth noting that none of the alternative electron acceptors was artificially added to the growth medium , yet the cells were still capable of utilizing fumarate as indicated by the marked increase in the expression of FrdA . 
It is generally assumed that only in the absence of oxygen and when no alternative electron acceptors are available does the cell switch to fermentative metabolism ( Gunsalus & Park , 1994 ) . 
However , in this study induction of ferment-ative enzymes was observed alongside the increase of FrdA . 
The highest increase in expression detected in this study was for the enzyme pyruvate formate lyase ( PflI ) , which catalyses the breakdown of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA , thus providing a gateway for the mixed-acid fermentations ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The PflI protein was detected in a series of six isoforms that differed in both pI and molecular mass . 
All isoforms showed high levels of increase induced by the lack of oxygen , ranging from 29.26-fold to 6.67-fold , giving a total of a 96.3-fold increase for strain 74 and 102.82-fold for strain 204 . 
This prominent expression change suggests that , under anaerobic conditions , Salmonella Typhimurium switches rapidly to fermentative metabolism . 
Changes in expression of several other enzymes known to catalyse the fermentative breakdown of sugars were also detected in this study . 
Enteric bacteria are known to utilize three different enzyme systems that act upon pyruvate under fermentative conditions ( mixed-acid fermentation ) . 
These are pyruvate formate lyase , lactate dehydrogenase and a-acetolactate synthase . 
As part of the a-acetolactate synthase , the enzyme acetate kinase ( AckA ) converts acetyl phosphate to acetate and the reaction is coupled to the synthesis of ATP ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The AckA enzyme increased under anaerobic conditions to a similar level in both strains . 
The second enzyme involved in this fermentative pathway , phosphotransacetylase , was not detected . 
Another fermentative enzyme that was detected anaerobically was alcohol-aldehyde dehydrogenase ( AdhE ) . 
The enzyme has dual activity and functions as both alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , converting acetyl-CoA to ethanol as part of the mixed-acid fermentation of sugars ( Clark & Cronan , 1980 ) . 
AdhE co-migrated with pyruvate dehydrogenase in spot 1 , which showed a four - to fivefold increase in spot volume in both strains . 
As pyruvate dehydrogenase has been reported to decrease under anaerobic conditions , it is unlikely that it contributes to the observed increase , and it can be speculated that this is due to the AdhE . 
For a more accurate assessment , different pH ranges can be used ( e.g. 4.525.5 ) in order to distinguish the two enzymes . 
Furthermore , in E. coli AdhE has been demonstrated to increase expression under anaerobic growth on 2D gels and its upregulation has been shown to be at the transcriptional level ( Leonardo et al. , 1993 ) . 
Overall , increase in expression was observed for most of the mixed-acid fermentation enzymes ( Fig. 2 ) , including PflI , which provides the main substrate for the pathways . 
Most of these enzymes are known to be induced by FNR anaerobically , the exception being AdhE , where a potential involvement of the regulatory cra ( catabolite repressor activator ) gene is suspected ( Mikulskis et al. , 1997 ; Salmon et al. , 2003 ; Fink et al. , 2007 ) .

* Level of change under anaerobic conditions in strain 74 or 204 , respectively . 
DStudent 's t-test value as calculated by the DeCyder software . 
Another set of fermentative enzymes that showed increase in expression under anaerobic conditions was the enzymes of the arcABC operon known to catalyse the degradation of arginine . 
These include arginine deiminase ( ArcA ) , ornithine carbamoyltransferase ( ArcB ) and carbamate kinase ( ArcC ) . 
The arcABC operon is , however , different from the arcA/B regulatory system despite the identical gene names . 
Arginine is fermented by S. enterica to ornithine , CO2 and NH3 , and the process is unusual as ATP is formed from carbamoyl phosphate . 
Both enzymes ArcA and ArcB were present in two isoforms that showed increases in expression . 
The existence of different isoforms of these enzymes has apparently not been reported previously but this may be due to sample preparation . 
The cumulative expression change for ArcA and ArcB was identical for both isolates , while ArcC was present in only one isoform , and the increase observed was much less in strain 204 compared to 74 ( Table 1 ) . 
While the increased expression of the mixed-acid fermentation enzymes is characteristic for anaerobically grown S. enterica , the overexpression of the arcABC operon has not been previously associated with anaerobic adaptation ( Gunsalus & Park , 1994 ) . 
The arginine-degradation enzymes described above do not appear to be a part of either ArcA or FNR regulons , but their marked increase suggests that L-arginine is actively utilized as a carbon and energy source in the absence of oxygen . 
The greatest measured increase for a single spot in strain 74 was observed for one of the isoforms of the enzyme aspartate ammonia lyase ( AspA ) . 
The other isoform differed slightly in pI and also showed an increase in expression . 
The observed total increase was twice as high in strain 74 compared to 204 . 
AspA catalyses the conversion of L-aspartate to fumarate , which is the second step in the pathway for the utilization of glutamate as carbon source ( Marcus & Halpren , 1969 ) . 
The first step in the pathway is catalysed by aspartate aminotransferase ( AspC ) , which was also anaerobically overexpressed approximately sixfold in both strains ( Table 1 ) . 
There is no evidence that AspA and AspC are under the control of FNR or ArcA/B and their anaerobic overexpression has not been described previously . 
It is possible that they supply the cell with an alternative electron acceptor by converting available amino acids , such as glutamate or aspartate , to fumarate . 
Fig. 2 . 
Mixed-acid fermentation pathways utilized by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium when grown anaerobically . 
The 2D GE spots corresponding to the fermentation enzymes detected in this study and their estimated levels of change are displayed . 
Where more than one isoform was detected per protein the combined level of change is presented . 
Another novel expression change observed was the induction of the two malic enzymes under anaerobiosis . 
Malic enzymes catalyse the oxidative decarboxylation of malate coupled with the reduction of NAD or NADP to + + produce pyruvate and CO2 ( Chang & Tong , 2003 ) . 
In E. coli , two genes , sfcA and maeB , that possess homology with malic enzymes have been described ( Bologna et al. , 2007 ) . 
The products of both genes were detected in this study and were both overexpressed anaerobically . 
The MaeB enzyme was detected in two isoforms with different pI ( Fig. 1 ) , resulting in a total increase in expression of 24 -- 25-fold . 
This was the fourth biggest increase measured in this study , suggesting an important role for the MaeB enzyme in anaerobic metabolism . 
The SfcA protein was detected in a single spot and showed only a three - to fourfold increase . 
The two malic enzymes were uniformly overexpressed between the two isolates ( Table 1 ) . 
Under anaerobic conditions , the C4 metabolism ( the reductive branch of the TCA cycle ) is enhanced by the action of the malic enzymes but their distinct roles have not been established ( Bologna et al. , 2007 ) . 
However , as the intracellular concentration of NADPH has been found to be higher than that of NADH ( Bochner & Ames , 1982 ) , the preferential expression of MaeB to SfcA might be due to the availability of its co-substrate ( Kwon et al. , 2007 ) . 
Furthermore , the two malic enzymes have not been found in either the FNR or ArcA/B regulons of S. enterica or E. coli and are not generally associated with anaerobic metabolism . 
During aerobic as well as anaerobic cell growth , glucose and various other substrates are channelled into the Embden -- Meyerhof -- Parnas pathway ( glycolysis ) . 
As glycolysis is a non-oxidative pathway , it is not dependent on the presence of oxygen in the environment . 
However , several proteomic investigations have reported the induction of some of the glycolytic enzymes in the absence of oxygen ; examples include anaerobically grown Bacillus subtilis ( Marino et al. , 2000 ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( Fuchs et al. , 2007 ) . 
In this study , increase in expression was detected for enolase and phosphoglycerate kinase , indicating enhanced glycolytic activity under anaerobic growth conditions . 
However , the expression levels of other glycolytic enzymes remained unchanged . 
Depending on what nutrients are available to the cell , appropriate enzymes are synthesized to convert the substrates into intermediates of the major catabolic pathways . 
The two enzymes transketolase ( TktA ) and transaldolase ( TalB ) , which are part of the non-oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate cycle , were also induced anaerobically . 
TktA and TalB , through a series of reactions , convert the excess pentose phosphates back to hexose phosphates , which are then channelled into glycolysis . 
The observed increase of TktA and TalB was slightly higher in 74 compared to 204 . 
As expected , the other enzymes catalysing the oxidative steps of the pathway showed no increase in expression . 
Similarly , increase in expression was observed for purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( DeoD ) , which is involved in the catabolism of ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides . 
DeoD catalyses the conversion of nucleosides to a free base and pentose 1-phosphate , which are then shunted into other metabolic pathways such as glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway . 
DeoD is part of the deoxyribonucleoside complex of S. enterica , which is encoded by the deo operon . 
The regulation of the deo operon is unclear , as it has been suggested that it consists of two sets of genes that are regulated differentially ( Robertson et al. , 1970 ) . 
Here we demonstrated that the expression level of at least one of the gene products ( DeoD ) is influenced by the presence of oxygen . 
Other proteins . 
The mannose-specific component and the E1 component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system were overexpressed during anaerobic growth , as were the heat-shock protein 90 and elongation factor G. However , their role in anaerobic adaptation is unclear . 
Proteins with decreased expression
Transport proteins . 
The largest functional group of proteins that showed decreased expression in the absence of oxygen were the periplasmic transport proteins . 
A total of 14 protein spots representing 11 proteins decreased in expression in the absence of oxygen . 
Four of those are involved in the transport of amino acids including lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding periplasmic protein ( ArgT ) , histidine-binding periplasmic protein ( HisJ ) , glutamate-aspartate-binding periplasmic protein ( GltI ) and ABC glutamine affinity transporter ( GlnQ ) . 
The four binding proteins represent the periplasmic components of their respective transport systems and are often used to quantify the levels of expression of the transport systems as a whole ( Kustu et al. , 1979 ) . 
Relatively little is known about the regulation of amino acid transport systems in S. enterica , but the four transporters mentioned above are subject to general control by the availability of nitrogen in the growth medium . 
Low levels of nitrogen appear to stimulate their expression . 
This could be a way to scavenge for amino acids as a nitrogen source under nitrogen-limiting conditions ( Kustu et al. , 1979 ) . 
However , the changes in their expression in the presence or absence of oxygen has never been described . 
In this study it was demonstrated that ArgT , HisJ , GlnQ and GltI are repressed anaerobically . 
They all showed a substantial decrease in expression level in both isolates and for all detectable isoforms ( three isoforms for GltI and two for GlnQ , Table 1 ) . 
While GltI and GlnQ have been defined as part of the FNR modulon of S. enterica ( Fink et al. , 2007 ) , it is not clear how ArgT and HisJ are regulated anaerobically , and the physiological significance of their downregulation is yet to be determined . 
In addition , two other transport proteins , the oligopeptidebinding protein precursor ( OppA ) and the dipeptidebinding protein precursor ( DppA ) , showed decreased expression in the absence of oxygen . 
In the reference 2D gel map of Salmonella Typhimurium , these transporters are present as a series of isoforms ( Encheva et al. , 2005 ) . 
Here , only one of all of the detectable isoforms ( the most prominent spot ) showed significant change in expression . 
It should be noted that other isoforms showed small decreases ( less than twofold ) , but as DIGE is only capable of detecting changes of twofold or more ( Karp et al. , 2004 ) , such small variations could not be reported in this study . 
However , if a more sensitive approach , capable of detecting even subtle changes , is used , it is possible that all isoforms will be shown to be repressed anaerobically . 
Both OppA and DppA are involved in the transport of peptides but , while DppA specifically binds dipeptides , OppA can transport peptides with up to five amino acids ( Higgins & Gibson , 1986 ) . 
The utilization of peptides plays a major role in the nutrition of enteric bacteria and there are only three peptide-uptake systems described in S. enterica : Opp , Dpp and Tpp ( tripeptide transport system ) . 
Tpp is poorly characterized and has been reported to be induced anaerobically ( Jamieson & Higgins , 1984 ) but it was not detected in this study . 
OppA has been demonstrated to be the largest as well as the most abundant of all periplasmic proteins ( Hiles & Higgins , 1986 ) . 
This corresponds well with our observation that OppA was one of the most abundant spots in the 2D gel profile of S. enterica when grown aerobically . 
However , under anaerobic conditions , OppA was only detected as a faint spot . 
Its spot volume showed a larger decrease in isolate 204 , 8.59-fold compared to only 3.17-fold in isolate 74 , while DppA showed the opposite trend , decreasing 6.67-fold in 74 in comparison to only 3.91-fold in 204 . 
DppA and OppA are also part of the FNR modulon of S. enterica ( Fink et al. , 2007 ) . 
In addition to the transport of amino acids and peptides , proteins involved in the uptake of iron ( SitA ) , glycerol 3-phosphate ( UgpB ) , dicarboxylic acids ( YiaO ) and thiosulphate ( CysP ) were also downregulated but the mechanisms of their regulation have not been established . 
It appears that under anaerobic conditions transport of various substances is suppressed via either FNR or other regulatory pathways . 
As with all permeases , the uptake of their substrates is coupled to ATP hydrolysis , which may be difficult to sustain under the conditions of fumarate respiration . 
This may explain the repressed expression of the various transport proteins observed here . 
Various enzymes . 
The greatest decrease in expression observed in this study was for the enzyme Mn - binding 2 + superoxide dismutase ( SodA ) . 
The enzyme was present as one of the most prominent spots aerobically in both isolates , but was barely detectable under anaerobic conditions . 
Its expression decreased 54.12-fold in strain 74 and 74.41-fold in strain 204 . 
SodA protects the cells from oxidative damage by removing the superoxide radicals generated as a result of oxidative metabolism ( Beyer et al. , 1991 ) ; therefore its suppression under anaerobic growth is not surprising . 
The sodA gene is under the control of six different transcriptional regulators , including FNR , which acts as a repressor in the absence of oxygen ( Hassan & Sun , 1992 ; Compan & Touati , 1993 ) . 
ATP synthase catalyses the formation of ATP in the terminal step of oxidative phosphorylation . 
It can also catalyse the hydrolysis of ATP in order to generate transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient ( Weber & Senior , 2003 ) . 
The F1F0-ATP synthase of E. coli consists of eight subunits ( chains ) a3b3cdeab2cn ( Capaldi & Aggeler , 2002 ) , of which only one , the a-chain , was detected here . 
The a-chain was present in two isoforms ( Fig. 1 ) , which were both underexpressed anaerobically . 
The b-chain could not be identified in this study but a protein spot migrating to a similar position on the 2D map showed no change in expression . 
However , its identity could not be confirmed by PMF . 
The other subunits were not detected , most likely due to their close association with the plasma membrane or their low molecular mass . 
This is in agreement with many other gel-based proteomic studies of bacteria where the a - and b-chains are the most frequently observed subunits of the ATP synthase . 
The enzyme inositol monophosphatase ( SuhB ) showed a substantial decrease in expression in both isolates ( Table 1 ) . 
It has been shown that , as well as inositol monophosphatase activity , SuhB has an effect on sensitivity to low temperatures in E. coli ( Chen & Roberts , 2000 ) . 
The function of this enzyme in bacterial cells , as well as the mechanisms that regulate its expression , are not clear . 
It has been suggested that SuhB functions as a regulator of gene expression by modulating RNA turnover ( Inada & Nakamura , 1996 ) and that the enzyme production is autoregulated ( Inada & Nakamura , 1996 ) . 
This appears to be the first study that has reported change in expression of SuhB in the absence of oxygen . 
If the enzyme functions as a regulatory protein it appears that this is only required in an aerobic environment . 
Chaperones , stress response and hypothetical proteins . 
Several chaperone proteins were repressed anaerobically , including DnaK and GroS . 
In addition , the stringent starvation protein A ( SspA ) , the phage shock protein A 
( PspA ) , the osmotically induced protein C ( OsmC ) and the universal stress protein ( UspG ) also showed decreased expression . 
PspA is generally induced by stresses that can damage the integrity of the cell membrane , such as heat shock , ethanol treatment , hyperosmotic shock or exposure to organic solvents ( Jovanovic et al. , 2006 ) . 
OsmC is a general stress-response protein in E. coli and has been demonstrated to be upregulated under osmotic or oxidative stress ( Lesniak et al. , 2003 ; Weber et al. , 2006 ) . 
OsmC is not part of the FNR or ArcA modulons , but is under the control of RpoS , the leucine-response protein ( Lrp ) and histone-like protein HNS ( Bouvier et al. , 1998 ) . 
Overall it appears that several chaperones and stress-induced proteins are part of the defence mechanism of S. enterica against oxidative damage . 
In the absence of oxygen they are repressed as a result of the action of various transcriptional regulators other than FNR . 
Three hypothetical proteins , YjgA , YajQ and YaeH , were also downregulated anaerobically . 
The greatest decrease was observed for YaeH , which was present as an abundant spot aerobically ( sevenfold in 74 and 11-fold in 204 ) . 
The hypothetical proteins belong to an uncharacterized protein family , and their function and regulation are yet to be defined . 
Strain-specific changes
Apart from variations observed in the degree of change in several enzymes and transport proteins , strain-specific changes were also detected . 
Two enzymes associated with the metabolism of glycerol , glycerol kinase ( GlpK ) and glycerol dehydrogenase ( GldA ) , showed increase in expression only in strain 74 . 
The two enzymes catalyse the first steps of two alternative pathways for glycerol utilization described in Klebsiella pneumoniae . 
However , little is known about their function in S. enterica ( Forage & Lin , 1982 ; Lynch & Lin , 1996 ) . 
GlpK is part of the glp system , which functions aerobically , while GldA is part of the dha system , which is normally inducible only anaerobically by glycerol or dihydroacetone ( Forage & Lin , 1982 ) . 
While E. coli is not capable of growing solely on glycerol due to the absence of the dha pathway , it appears that some isolates of S. enterica overexpress the two systems in an attempt to utilize glycerol in the absence of oxygen . 
In addition , increase in expression of the enzyme CTP synthase ( PyrG ) and CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose-3-dehydratase ( RfbH ) under anaerobic growth was also observed only in strain 74 . 
The only 204-specific change was the observed decrease for the helix-destabilizing protein Ssb . 
Some of the strain-specific changes observed in this study provide an indication of additional pathways and functions that are induced anaerobically . 
However , more detailed analysis of the proteome , including various fractionation strategies or/and gel-free quantification , could provide further insights into the activity of the cell of Salmonella Typhimurium under anaerobiosis . 
Conclusion
The mechanisms underlying the ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate in the absence of oxygen remain an area of interest , as they can reveal what protein factors are functioning at the onset of gastroenteritis . 
This study aimed to characterize the changes in the proteome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium which may reveal what protein factors allow this species to adapt and initiate infection in anaerobic environments . 
Two unrelated isolates were tested and a drastic transformation of their expression patterns was observed with the shift to anaerobiosis . 
Several of the proteins detected in this study have already been associated with anaerobic growth , such as PflI and FrdA , and have been shown to be under the control of the global regulators FNR and ArcA/B . 
Despite the fact that the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes is well studied on an individual basis , less is known about their coordinated regulation . 
Here we demonstrate upregulation of ferment-ative as well as anaerobic respiration enzymes , suggesting important roles for both in anaerobic metabolism . 
Overall , catabolic pathways such as mixed-acid fermentation , arginine fermentation , glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway were upregulated . 
Simultaneously , several permeases transporting various substances such as amino acids , peptides , iron , glycerol 3-phosphate and dicarboxylic acids were repressed ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Although FNR is considered to be the main regulator of the adaptive response to anaerobiosis , of the 65 proteins that showed changed expression only nine have currently been identified as part of the FNR/oxrA regulon of S. enterica . 
This may be a result of the incomplete characterization of the regulon , or indication that the regulatory networks modulating the anaerobic adaptation are more complex than originally envisaged . 
Some of the changes observed here could also be a result of the accumulation of by-products of S. enterica 's own metabol-ism and therefore under the control of other factors . 
As most proteins appear to be a part of more than one regulatory circuit , the prediction of their degree of change under certain environmental conditions is difficult . 
Therefore , the combination of comparative proteomics using DIGE for quantification and MS for protein identification provides a valuable insight into the transformation that Salmonella Typhimurium undergoes when adapting to anoxic environments . 
Here it is also demonstrated that the adaptive response is not uniform between different isolates . 
Differences in the degree of over - or underexpression of certain proteins , as well as some unique changes characteristic for only one of the two isolates , were detected . 
The high degree of change measured for some proteins in this study illustrates the potential shortcoming of using laboratory-grown strains to search for suitable vaccine targets . 
Therefore characterizing the protein expression in conditions resembling the host environment could contribute significantly to more focused development of novel diagnostic and vaccine targets . 
Overall , the use of the quantitative proteomic approach to study the changes in expression during adaptation to anaerobic growth provides validation for enzymes previously associated with anaerobic metabolism and adds useful descriptive information on bacterial responses to altered oxygen levels .
