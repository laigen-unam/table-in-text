Article history : 
Maintaining effective sanitizer concentration is of critical importance for preventing pathogen survival and transference during fresh-cut produce wash operation and for ensuring the safety of ﬁnished products . 
However , maintaining an adequate level of sanitizer in wash water can be challenging for processors due to the large organic load in the wash system . 
In this study , we investigated how the survival of human pathogens was affected by the dynamic changes in water quality during chlorine depletion and replenishment in simulated produce washing operations . 
Lettuce extract was added incrementally into water containing pre-set levels of free chlorine to simulate the chlorine depletion process , and sodium hypochlorite was added incrementally into water containing pre-set levels of lettuce extract to simulate chlorine replenishment . 
Key water quality parameters were closely monitored and the bactericidal activity of the wash water was evaluated using three-strain cocktails of Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , Salmonella enterica , and Listeria monocytogenes . 
In both chlorine depletion and replenishment processes , no pathogen survival was observed when wash water free chlorine level was maintained above 3.66 mg/L , irrespective of the initial free chlorine levels ( 10 , 50 , 100 and 200 mg/L ) or organic loading ( chemical oxidation demand levels of 0 , 532 , 1013 and 1705 mg/L ) . 
At this free chlorine concentration , the measured ORP was 843 mV and pH was 5.12 for the chlorine depletion process ; the measured ORP was 714 mV and pH was 6.97 for the chlorine replenishment process . 
This study provides quantitative data needed by the fresh-cut produce industry and the regulatory agencies to establish critical operational control parameters to prevent pathogen survival and cross-contamination during fresh produce washing .

1. Introduction
Fresh and fresh-cut produce is susceptible to microbial contamination during wash operation ( Lehto et al. , 2011 ; Olaimat and Holley , 2012 ) . 
Processing water is commonly re-circulated and reused for economic and environmental considerations . 
This wash water often contains soils , plant debris , and organic materials released from cut or damaged produce . 
Pathogens from contaminated produce can be dislodged from the plant surfaces and transferred to clean produce , thus resulting in cross-contamination . 
Therefore , maintaining effective sanitizer concentrations in wash water is critical for ensuring food safety of fresh and fresh-cut produce ( Luo et al. , 2012 ; Gil et al. , 2009 ; Simons , 1997 ) . 
Currently , several types of sanitizers are commonly used in the produce industry , including chlorine , peroxyacetic acid , ozone , and organic acids ( USFDA , 2013 ) . 
Among those , chlorine is the most widely used sanitizer because of its low impact on the nutritional and aesthetic quality of the product , established ability to kill pathogens in suspension , and low cost ( Adams et al. , 1989 ; Zhuang et al. , 1995 ) . 
Although chlorine has limited efﬁcacy on pathogen reduction from produce surface , its capacity in inactivating path-ogens in suspension make it an effective antimicrobial agent for controlling wash water pathogens

Despite widespread use by the fresh-cut produce industry , chlorine 's rapid reaction with organic materials and consequent loss of efﬁcacy has been problematic ( Nou and Luo , 2010 ) . 
Although coarse debris is typically removed by mechanical screens , soluble organic matter still accumulates in the wash water over time , along with the formation of chloramines and organochloramines ( Beuchat et al. , 1998 ; Garg , 1990 ; Luo et al. , 2012 ; Pirovani et al. , 2001 ) . 
During the washing process , only a limited amount of fresh water is added to the wash system to compensate for water loss during washing . 
Water re-circulation allows steady organic matter accumulation and accelerated free chlorine depletion . 
To maintain a steady free chlorine level , concentrated sodium hypochlorite ( NaClO ) is frequently added to the wash system . 
In the absence of organic matter , free chlorine concentration is proportional to the NaClO added in a given system . 
However , in the presence of organic matter , chlorine dosing is a technical challenge as the complex chlorination breakpoint has to be considered ( Zhou et al. , 2014 ) . 
Efﬁcacy of chlorine to inactivate pathogens is impacted by several factors , including chlorine concentration , pH , contact time , and pathogen strain ( Virto et al. , 2005 ) . 
Chlorine 's efﬁcacy to inactivate pathogens is positively correlated with chlorine concentration and exposure time in the chlorine demand-free liquid system ( Kouame and Haas , 1991 ) . 
In general , higher than 5 log cfu/L pathogen reduction can be achieved with 0.5 e1 .0 mg / L free chlorine with 30 s or longer exposure ( Luo et al. , 2011 ; Shen et al. , 2013 ; Van Haute et al. , 2013 ) . 
However , studies regarding the effect of chlorine on pathogen inactivation in the presence of organic matters are limited , and critical data gaps exist in many areas ( Shen et al. , 2013 ; Gomez-Lopez , 2014 ; Van Haute et al. , 2013 ) . 
Although chlorine is often considered a Critical Control Point ( CCP ) in the industry-wide Hazardous Analysis and Critical Control Point ( HACCP ) program , scientiﬁc validation for the critical control limit during produce wash operation is lacking . 
The fresh-cut produce industry needs information on which operational parameters e.g. , sanitizer concentration , pH , residence time , organic load , etc. are critical to measure and monitor , as well as the signiﬁcance of the measurements in terms of the performance of the wash water as a microbial control system . 
Hence , research projects that can address these data gaps are vital ( CPS , 2014 ; 2011 ; 2012 , 2013 ) . 
Recently , a study from Gomez-Lopez et al. ( 2014 ) reported that the minimum free chlorine of 5 mg/L is required to keep water free from foodborne pathogens during produce wash using a dynamic produce wash system . 
However , the exact role of initial chlorine concentration and the level of organic matter , and especially their interaction on chlorine depletion and replenishment processes remain unknown . 
Furthermore , some studies shown that Listeria monocytegenes is more resistant to environmental stresses than Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , Salmonella enterica ; yet their comparative survival patterns during chlorine depletion and replenishment processes are unknown . 
Thus , this study is designed to address these critical data gaps , and to identify the most critical factors that directly impact pathogen inactivation and survival during produce wash in the presence of organic load . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Lettuce extract preparation
Iceberg lettuce was purchased from a local produce wholesale market , cut into pieces , pressed through a household juicer , and ﬁltered through eight layers of cheesecloth . 
Filtered iceberg lettuce extract was aliquoted and stored at 20 C for use throughout this study . 
2.2. Bacterial strains and culture preparation
A three-strain cocktail of E. coli O157 : H7 with nalidixic acid resistance , a three-strain cocktail of S. enterica transformed with plasmid pGT-KAN , and a three-strain cocktail of Listeria monocytogenes were used in this study ( Table 1 ) . 
A single colony for each strain was inoculated into 30 mL tryptic soy broth ( TSB , Neogen , Lansing , MI , USA ) with 50 mg/L nalidixic acid ( for E. coli ) , 50 mg/L kanamycin ( for Salmonella ) , or without antibiotics ( for L. monocytogenes ) and incubated for 20 h at 37 C with shaking . 
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,300 g for 5 min , washed once in sterile phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and re-suspended in 10 mL of PBS . 
Equal volumes of cell suspensions from each strain were mixed and diluted in PBS to achieve a cocktail of inoculum with approximately 108 CFU/mL for each of the three species . 
2.3. Simulation of chlorine depletion in wash water
Sodium hypochlorite ( NaClO ) ( 7.56 % ) was added to 3 L of water to obtain chlorinated water with targeted initial free chlorine concentrations of 10 , 50 , 100 , and 200 mg/L . 
The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with 25 % citric acid . 
Lettuce extract was incrementally added to the chlorinated water in 2 mL aliquots every 2 min to simulate the accumulating organic load in commercial fresh-cut lettuce wash water . 
Water samples were taken at varying intervals of lettuce extract addition , depending on the expected impact of the incremental increase in organic load on free chlorine concentration . 
Higher sampling frequencies were applied when free chlorine levels changed more precipitously . 
Water samples were taken one minute after lettuce extract addition and analyzed for chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) , oxidationereduction potential ( ORP ) , pH , and free and total chlorine . 
Three aliquots ( 15 mL ) of wash water were removed at each of the indicated sampling points for assessing bactericidal activities using the cocktails representing the three bacterial species . 
Bacteria cells in each cocktail were exposed to the water sample at a ratio of 1:100 for 30 s , followed by neutralizing the residual chlorine with 0.1 % sodium thiosulfate , and enumerating the surviving populations using a modiﬁed most probable number ( MPN ) method ( Section 2.5 ) . 
2.4. Simulation of chlorine replenishment in wash water
Wash water was simulated by adding lettuce extract to distilled water to reach a ﬁnal concentration of 1.2 % , 2.4 % , and 3.6 % with COD levels averaging at 532 , 1013 , and 1705 mg/L . 
NaClO was repeatedly added in 4 mg/L increments in 3 min intervals to the simulated wash water containing different levels of lettuce extract until the ﬁnal chlorine concentration passed the chlorination breakpoint ( the point where chlorine demand in the simulated wash water was fully satisﬁed and free chlorine started to increase proportionally to added NaClO ) . 
Two minutes after each chlorine addition , a water sample was taken and analyzed for ORP , pH , and free and total chlorine . 
Bactericidal activity was determined as described in section 2.3 . 
2.5. Water quality assays and bacterial enumeration
COD , ORP , pH , total and free chlorine in simulated wash water were determined as previously described ( Zhou et al. , 2014 ) . 
For bacterial enumeration , a previously described mini-most probable number ( MPN ) method was adapted with modiﬁcations ( Zho et al. , 2014 ) . 
Brieﬂy , aliquots ( 0.3 mL ) of neutralized bacteria-wash water solutions were added to 2.7 mL of TSB containing 0.1 % so-dium pyruvate , with antibiotics ( 50 mg/L of nalidixic acid for E. coli O157 : H7 , or 50 mg/L of kanamycin for Salmonella , respectively ) , or to 2.7 mL of Listeria enrichment broth with selective supplements ( Thermal Scientiﬁc , Odessa , TX ) for L. monocytogenes . 
After 10-fold serial dilutions in the same media and incubation at 37 C for 18 h , aliquots ( 3 ml ) of the enriched culture from each well were arrayed onto MacConkey agar containing 50 mg/L of nalidixic acid , TSA containing 50 mg/L of kanamycin , and PALCAM ( Thermal Scientiﬁc ) for E. coli O157 : H7 , S. enterica , and L. monocytogenes , respectively . 
Following incubation at 37 C overnight , the numbers of wells for each dilution that gave rise to pale colonies characteristic of E. coli O157 : H7 , green ﬂuorescent colonies characteristic of Salmonella , and dark colonies characteristic of L. monocytogenes on respective selective plates were recorded and used for calculating the MPN of human pathogens in each water sample . 
2.6. Experimental design and data analyses
All experiments were run in triplicates . 
Water-quality measurements for ORP , pH , and total and free chlorine were analyzed as a function of lettuce extract concentration and cumulative NaClO addition . 
Data related to human pathogen populations were logtransformed and analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance among treatments using the general linear model of SAS 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) . 
When the effects were statistically signiﬁcant , mean comparisons were determined with Sidak adjusted P values to maintain the experimentewise error ( a ) at 0.05 . 
A correlation matrix for all measured parameters , including water quality attri-butes and the survival potential of each of the tested human pathogens was constructed using the CORR procedure of SAS , which provided a value for the Spearman correlation ( rs ) and the associated P value . 
Fresh-cut produce processing consumes large amounts of fresh water . 
In commercial operations , organic matter from plant tissue , debris , and soil disperse quickly in wash water upon entering the washing tank , leading to rapid water quality deterioration and chlorine depletion . 
In this study , the chlorine depletion process in wash water was simulated by incremental increases of organic matters in the form of lettuce extract . 
The changes in wash water quality and its association with the dynamics of pathogen survival in wash water during this process is closely monitored . 
As shown in Fig. 1A , free chlorine concentration decreased immediately upon the introduction of organic matter , and eventually depleted following the continued introduction of organic matter . 
This is in agreement with observations in previous studies ( Luo et al. , 2012 ; Van Haute et al. , 2013 ; Zhou et al. , 2014 ) . 
However , in the high initial chlorine treatment groups ( 100 and 200 mg/L ) , when plotting the data against logarithmic scale , a two-phased decline in chlorine concentration was observed ( Fig. 1a ) , i.e. a rapid decline followed by a slow decline . 
While free chlorine depleted rapidly in the low initial chlorine treatment , free chlorine leveled off at around 0.5 mg/L , following the continued introduction of organic materials . 
This result is likely attributable to the conversion between chloramines and chlorine . 
Studies have shown that organic chloramines can be hydrolyzed to release free chlorine ( Phenyl-arsine Oxide or N , N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine ) , and , subsequently , interfere with the measurement of free chlorine using amperometric titration or DPD method ( Jensen and Johnson , 1990a , b ) . 
As wash water is loaded continuously with organics , the formation of large amounts of organic chloramines could falsely augment free chlorine measurements using DPD method , and thus result in overestimation of available free chlorine . 
Total chlorine also declines following the introduction of organic materials , however at a much slower rate than free chlorine ( Fig. 1B ) , since total chlorine includes both free chlorine and chloramines . 
In addition , the residual total chlorine approaches a stable level , which is proportional to the initial free chlorine level . 
This also indicates that chloramines accumulate during the addition of organic materials . 
At the beginning of the test , the pH of all chlorinated water was adjusted to 6.5 with citric acid . 
As the concentration of lettuce extract ( shown as COD ) increased , the organic materials were oxidized to combined chloramines , with the formation of protons ( White , 1999 ) . 
This explains the steady declining pH ( Fig. 1C ) . 
The decrease in pH of wash water with high initial concentration of NaClO was slower with the addition of organic material ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Therefore , the actual measured pH level of the wash water is a function of the amount of lettuce extract and sodium hypochlorite added . 
ORP values increased initially following the introduction of organic material ( Fig. 1D ) . 
Since ORP is a function of pH and free chlorine , the slight increase in ORP is mostly likely attributable to the sharp decline in pH and slight decline in free chlorine initially . 
However , with the continued organic load input and decline in free chlorine concentration , there were sharp declines in ORP values

Both cumulative addition of lettuce extract and corresponding COD values are shown in the x-axis . 
Note that water sampling frequencies varied for wash water with different initial free chlorine levels and at different stages of free chlorine depletion . 
E. coli O157 : H7 , S. enterica and L. monocytogenes are foodborne pathogens frequently associated with fresh produce ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013 ; Grifﬁn and Tauxe , 1991 ; Scallan et al. , 2011 ) . 
The FDA established a zero tolerance policy for these pathogens in fresh and fresh-cut produce . 
In this study , the survival of these three types of human pathogens over the chlorine depletion process was investigated . 
During chlorine decline , following the introduction of organic materials , wash water bactericidal activity remained strong initially with no pathogen survival in the wash solutions ( Fig. 2AeC ) . 
However , with continued organic loading and free chlorine loss , survival was observed in the wash solution . 
Among all four initial chlorine treatments , the higher the initial free chlorine level , the more organic loading the wash water handled before pathogen survival was observed . 
Pathogen survival was observed ﬁrst with the lowest initial chlorine , occurring after the accumulated addition of 2.91 mL/L lettuce extract , or the COD level reached 169 mg/L . 
On the other hand , the treatment containing the highest initial chlorine level did not shown any pathogen survival until after the accumulated addition of 39.58 mL/L of lettuce extract or the COD reached 1658 mg/L . 
Plotting the pathogen survival against the free chlorine measured in the system ( Fig. 2DeF and Table 2 ) revealed that no pathogen survival was detected when free chlorine was maintained at 3.66 mg/L or above , regardless of initial chlorine concentration and organic loading . 
These results also indicate that under high organic loads , the free chlorine concentration needed to ensure water free of pathogens needs to be kept higher than 3.66 mg/L . 
Similar ﬁndings were reported by Gomez-Lopez et al. ( 2014 ) . 
In addition , the simulated wash water with higher organic load has a lower critical free chlorine level than other treatments ( Table 2 ) , probably attributable to the microbial inactivation of chloramines . 
The monochloramine can inactivate microorganisms by damaging cell membranes and breaking DNA ( Ingols , 1958 ; Rose et al. , 2007 ; Shih and Lederberg , 1976 ) . 
Organic chloramines also can be used as disinfectants in water treatment ( Amiri et al. , 2010 ; Donnermair and Blatchley , 2003 ; Swango et al. , 1987 ) . 
Furthermore , free chlorine and chloramines have a synergic effect on inactivating bacterial cells ( Kouame and Haas , 1991 ) . 
Table 2 summarizes the wash water conditions when pathogen survival was ﬁrst observed during chlorine depletion . 
S. enterica and L. monocytogenes have been reported as being more resistant to chlorine inactivation than E. coli O157 : H7 ( Shen et al. , 2013 ; Van Haute et al. , 2013 ) . 
In our current study , a series of free chlorine residues was captured for the analysis of inactivation of three human pathogens . 
The results indicated that no signiﬁcant difference in survival patterns was observed among those three major food-borne patho-gens ( P < 0.01 ) over the dynamic change of free chlorine residue . 
This suggests that bacterial strain is not likely to be a signiﬁcant factor for bacterial inactivation in a free chlorine based produce washing system . 
3.2 . 
Pathogen survival dynamics during chlorine depletion process 
Addition of NaClO to process water is a common practice within the fresh produce industry to restore chlorine level in order to avoid cross-contamination ( Gomez-Lopez et al. , 2014 ; Van Haute et al. , 2013 ) . 
In this study , the chlorine replenishment in wash water was simulated by incremental addition of NaClO to water containing varying levels of lettuce extract . 
The change in free chlorine level was monitored in wash water with varying organic load i response to accumulating NaClO . 
As shown in Fig. 3A , the changes in free chlorine followed the typical pattern for breakpoint chlorination ( Zhou et al. , 2014 ) during the addition of NaClO . 
In the absence of organic materials , free chlorine increased immediately following the addition of NaClO . 
However , the increase in free chlorine concentration was signiﬁcantly delayed in the presence of organic materials ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Increased organic loading resulted in longer lag periods before the chlorination breakpoint , when the chlorine demand in the wash water was fully met , and the free chlorine level increased linearly with the addition of NaClO . 
It was also observed that under conditions of high organic load ( greater than 1000 mg/L ) , free chlorine concentration bounced around 1.00 mg/L , before the process approached the breakpoint . 
Total chlorine increased immediately with the addition of NaClO , on the other hand , irrespective of the organic load ( Fig. 3B ) . 
However , the coefﬁcient between total chlorine and cumulative NaClO input was far less than 1 , suggesting that there existed complex reactions between chlorine and organic components of lettuce extract : some generate chloramines , and others consume NaClO . 
Toivonen and Lu ( 2013 ) found that the organic materials released from cut fruit and vegetable tissue have different potential to quench free chlorine from wash water . 
In addition , Deborde and von Gunten ( 2008 ) have reported that there are three kinds of reactions : oxidation reactions , addition reactions to unsaturated bonds , and electrophilic substitution reactions at nucleophilic sites , depending on the chemical structure and oxidative capacity of free chlorine and the different components of organic materials . 
Fig. 3C shows the pH changes in wash water with varying organic load as a function of chlorine addition . 
During the cumulative addition of NaClO to wash water with varying concentrations of lettuce extract , the change in pH follows a three-stage progression that includes a steady increase , followed by a steep decline , and another sharp increase . 
The bottom of the second stage coincided with the chlorination breakpoint . 
This conﬁrms our earlier ﬁndings ( Zhou et al. , 2014 ) . 
The changes in ORP during chlorine replenishment are shown in Fig. 3D . 
ORP initially increases gradually , followed by a sharp increase until it reaches a plateau . 
When the chlorine replenishment passes the breakpoints , the ORP of wash water for all levels of organic load was over 650 mV , which has been reported as the minimum threshold for typical anti-bacterial activity ( Steininger , 1985 ) . 
It should be noted that during chlorine replenishment , the ORP reading past the breakpoint was much lower than the ORP reading at the corresponding point ( in terms of free chlorine and COD levels ) during the simulated chlorine depletion ( Fig. 1D ) . 
This discrepancy was due to the water pH in these cases . 
While pH was not controlled in the simulated chlorine replenishment , pH in the wash water used for simulating free chlorine depletion was initially adjusted to 6.5 , resulting in a lower pH when the lettuce extract was introduced .

3.4. Pathogen survival dynamics during chlorine replenishment process
Water recirculation could increase the potential risk of foodborne illness by readily distributing contaminants to noncontaminated produce . 
It has been documented that E. coli O157 : H7 strains can survive in the holding tank if wash water is not sanitized effectively , be circulated back to the washing tank and cross-contaminate newly loaded produce during the washing process ( Gomez-Lopez , 2014 ) . 
Fig. 4AeC depict the survival of E. coli 
O157 : H7 , S. enterica and L. monocytogenes , respectively , during the course of chlorine replenishment as impacted by the wash water organic load . 
In the absence of organic load , bacterial cell populations decline rapidly following the addition of NaClO to the wash water , quickly reaching undetectable level with the continued addition of NaClO . 
In contrast , for wash water with varying levels of organic load , there is a period of time during which all added NaClO is reacting with organic matter and no free chlorine is available to inactivate bacteria . 
Thus the bacterial cell population declined more gradually and survived through the addition of a number of aliquots of NaClO , which resulted in a signiﬁcantly less steep slope in Fig. 4AeC ( P < 0.01 ) . 
The length of the survival period was positively and the slope was negatively correlated with the organic load . 
Fig. 4DeF show scatter plots of the pathogen survival patterns over the measured free chlorine concentration . 
Similar to that observed during the chlorine depletion process , pathogen survival was highly correlated to the free chlorine concentration , regardless of the initial organic load . 
All pathogens were completed eliminated when the free chlorine exceeded 3.58 mg/L ( Fig. 4DeF and Table 3 ) , which corresponds to an ORP value of 740 mv ( Fig. 3A and D ) . 
This suggests that the impact of organic load on pathogen inactivation is indirect , and its impact on chlorine concentration is direct ; the key factor controlling the pathogen survival and inactivation is the available or residual chlorine concentration . 
It is worth noting that the maximal free chlorine level permissive to pathogen survival during chlorine depletion ( mean value 1/4 1.73 mg/L for four tested initial free chlorine levels ) was lower than that during the chlorine replenishment ( mean value 1/4 2.37 mg/L for four tested organic loads ) . 
In addition , at the point just prior to pathogen survival during chlorine depletion , there was a lower pH ( mean value 1/4 5.05 ) and thus higher ORP ( mean value 1/4 766 mv ) ( Table 2 ) . 
On the other hand , during chlorine replenishment , just after the pathogen became undetectable , there was a higher pH ( mean value 1/4 6.75 ) and lower ORP ( mea value 1/4 681 mv ) ( Table 3 ) . 
Overall , no pathogen survival was observed when the free chlorine level was maintained above 3.66 mg/L or an ORP above 850 mv . 
It is further worth noting that chlorine efﬁcacy to inactivate pathogens is dose-time dependant . 
In this study , data presented are obtained with 30 s reaction time . 
Higher chlorine concentration may be needed if a pathogen inactivation time less than 30 s is desired .

3.5. Correlations of wash water bactericidal activity and other water quality tributes
The survival of food-borne human pathogens is correlated to multiple variables that impact the quality of produce wash water . 
Spearman 's correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationship between microbial populations and water quality parameters ( Table 4 ) . 
For free chlorine depletion and replenishment in wash water , there were strong , negative , and monotonic correlations between surviving microbial populations and free chlorine ( P < 0.01 ) , and between surviving microbial populations and ORP ( P < 0.01 ) . 
However , the negative monotonic correlations between microbial populations and total chlorine levels were strong for the free chlorine depletion process ( P < 0.01 ) , and weak for chlorine replenishment in simulated wash water ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Regardless of the initial free chlorine ( in the free chlorine depletion process ) and COD ( in the chlorine replenishment process ) levels , both free chlorine levels ( Rs 1/4 0.76 to 0.85 ) and ORP ( Rs 1/4 0.60 to 0.65 ) are strong indicators of the survival potential by bacterial patho-gens in wash water . 
In order to be effective however , ORP must be controlled tightly over a narrow range . 
In current industry practices , ORP values vary with the tolerance of pH meter and controllers . 
If the tolerance is 0.5 , the range of ORP measurements could be 100 mv ( Steininger , 1985 ) . 
Therefore , it is difﬁcult to set

4. Conclusion
This study examined in-depth the inactivation dynamics of bacterial pathogens during chlorine depletion and replenishment processes with respect to varying initial chlorine concentration and organic load . 
Even though initial chlorine concentration and organic matter load are two important process factors during fresh-cut produce wash operation , their impact on pathogen survival and inactivation is indirect . 
Initial chlorine concentration primarily affects the capacity of the chlorinated wash water against decline in concentration as a result of its reaction with organic matter , whereas the organic load affects the rate of chlorine depletion or the total amount of concentrated sodium hypo-chlorite required to restore the desired chlorine concentration . 
During both chlorine depletion and replenishment processes , the free chlorine concentration that led to no pathogen survival ﬂuctuated from 0.71 to 3.66 mg/L , with no particular patterns exerted by either initial free chlorine concentration or organic load . 
This suggests that sanitizer strength as determined by available or re-sidual free chlorine concentration is the key factor controlling pathogen survival and inactivation in the wash system , irrespective of initial chlorine concentration and organic load . 
Considering all variables tested and assuming a 30 s exposure time , a minimum of 3.66 mg/L free chlorine ( at pH 5.12 e6 .97 ) , which represents a pathogen reduction of greater than 6 log cycles , is required at all times to ensure that the wash water is free of pathogens . 
However , a higher chlorine concentration is expected if the reaction time is shorter than 30 s . 
These ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship among wash water quality parameters and their association with pathogen survival and inactivation . 
This information can be used to help industry identify standard operational parameters to better control and monitor fresh-cut produce wash processes with improved pathogen control .
