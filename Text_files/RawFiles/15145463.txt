Abstract 
DNA microarrays and two-dimensional ( 2-D ) gel electrophoresis were utilized to analyze the global effect of bile on transcription and protein synthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Two bile-regulated proteins , YciF and PagC , were identiﬁed by 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry ﬁngerprinting . 
The operon yciGFE-katN demonstrated increased transcriptional activity in the presence of bile . 
While this operon has previously been shown to be RpoS-regulated , data from this study suggested that yciGFE-katN is regulated by bile independent of RpoS . 
The PhoP -- PhoQ-regulated PagC is decreased in the presence of bile . 
Characterization of the untranslated leader of pagC demonstrated that a 97-bp region is necessary for the bile-mediated repression of this promoter . 
Analysis of data from the DNA microarray revealed an effect of bile on important global mechanistic pathways in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
Genes involved in type III secretion-mediated invasion of epithelial cells demonstrated an overall repression of transcription in the presence of bile , corroborating previously reported data from this laboratory [ Infect . 
Immun . 
68 ( 2000 ) 6763 ] . 
In addition , bile-mediated transcriptional repression of genes involved in 
ﬂagellar biosynthesis and motility was observed . 
These data further demonstrate that bile is an important environmental signal sensed by Salmonella spp . 
and that bile plays a role in regulating bacterial gene expression in multiple virulence-associated pathways .

phospholipids and bilirubin to form bile . 
The bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the duodenum upon consumption of food , particularly fatty meals . 
Bile aids in digestion through degradation and dispersion of lipids . 
As a detergent-like substance , bile can also degrade lipid-containing membranes of bacteria . 
Most enteric organisms possess inherent resistance to bile that involve components such as porins ,

transport proteins , eﬄux pumps and lipopolysaccharide [ 1 -- 3 ] . 
In addition to resisting the detergent effects of bile , it appears that some bacteria utilize bile as a regulatory environmental signal to affect gene expression within the host [ 4 -- 8 ] . 
Bile has been demonstrated in both bacteria and parasites to regulate genes for bile resistance , as well as genes within pathways important for virulence [ 4 -- 10 ] . 
Bile salt hydrolase ( BSH ) is a protein found in most gastrointestinal commensals , but not enteropathogens , allowing for continued survival within the host [ 11 ] . 
Recently , BSH was identiﬁed in Listeria monocytoge-nes , a pathogenic organism [ 11 ] . 
In L. monocytogenes , BSH was demonstrated to be a virulence factor required for survival within the intestine and liver and is regulated by PrfA , a transcriptional activator that responds to signals within the host [ 11 ] . 
Gene regulation by bile has also been observed in the gastrointestinal parasite , Giardia lamblia , in which bile can be used as a metabolic substrate and plays a role in promoting encystation , which is critical for pathogenesis [ 9 ] . 
Shigella ﬂexneri grown in the presence of bile exhibits increased protein secretion and enhanced invasion of epithelial cells [ 5 ] . 
In Vibrio cholerae , bile enhances motility , while simultaneously repressing expression of other virulence factors , such as toxin co-regulated pilus and cholera toxin [ 4 ] . 
While regulation of motility by bile is not understood , it is thought that regulation of the V. cholerae virulence factors by bile occurs through modulation of the ToxT protein , the major virulence regulator [ 7 ] . 
All of these organisms depend upon proper expression of virulence factors to effectively cause infection , suggesting that pathogens use bile as a signal for appropriate temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , an etiologic agent of gastroenteritis , colonizes the distal ileum of the small intestine . 
S. enterica serovar Typhi , the etiologic agent of typhoid fever , interacts with bile both in the intestine and the human gallbladder . 
3 % -- 5 % of the population that is infected with Salmonella typhi will become asymptomatic carriers of the organism , for which the site of carriage is primarily the gallbladder . 
Salmonellae have been shown to resist concentrations of bile signiﬁcantly higher than that of other enteric organisms [ 8 ] and genes involved in bile resistance ( e.g. , the mar operon and the acrAB eﬄux pump ) are induced in the presence of bile [ 12 ] . 
Additionally , we demonstrated that bile reduced invasion of epithelial cells through transcriptional regulation of genes within the pathogenicity island-1 invasion pathway [ 6 ] . 
Finally , our laboratory has demonstrated that salmonellae form a bioﬁlm on gallstones in vitro [ 13 ] , consistent with the idea that chronic carriage of S. typhi is associated with gallbladder abnormalities , such as gallstones [ 14,15 ] . 
Interestingly , formation of a bioﬁlm on a gallstone requires the presence of bile in the media , suggesting that bile regulates factors necessary for bioﬁlm development [ 13 ] . 
We hypothesize that bile is an important environmental signal for Salmonella spp. , as it is necessary for environment-responsive gene regulation and protein modulation . 
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed to examine the effect of bile on protein levels from whole cell extracts , and DNA microarrays were utilized to determine the effect of bile on gene expression . 
These techniques allow for identiﬁcation of genes and proteins speciﬁcally affected by bile and provide a more global picture as to the effect of bile on different pathways . 
From this study , the effect of bile on invasion was corroborated , along with the identiﬁcation of novel effects on motility . 
This report more ﬁrmly establishes bile as an important regulatory signal in the interaction between salmonellae and their hosts .

2. Material and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and reagents
JSG210 ( ATCC14028s ) is the parent of all S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains . 
Bacterial strains provided for this study include : JSG1741 ( ﬂhC5456 : : MudJ ) , JSG1742 ( ﬂgC5215 : : MudJ ) , JSG1743 ( ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ) . 
Strains constructed for this study include : JSG237 ( pagC503 : : luc ) , JSG255 ( pagC325 : : luc ) , JSG256 ( pag-C673 : : luc ) , JSG257 ( pagC127 : : luc ) , JSG1591 ( pag-C407 : : luc ) , JSG1639 ( pagC : : lacZ ) , JSG1642 ( pagD : : lacZ ) , JSG1662 ( pmrD : : lacZ ) , JSG1942 ( yciG : : luc ) , JSG1943 ( yciG : : lucDrpoS : : FRT ) . 
All strains were maintained in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth or agar with appropriate antibiotics ( 50 lg of ampicillin per ml or 45 lg of kanamycin per ml ) . 
5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside ( Xgal ) was used at a concentration of 40 lg/ml . 
Bile used in this study is labeled `` sodium cholate '' and is a crude ox bile extract containing salts of deoxycholate , taurocholate , glycocholate , and cholate ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) . 
All primers used in this study are listed as supplementary material and available at http : / / www.medicine.osu.edu/mvimg/1188.cfm . 
2.2. Strain construction
DNA for yciG , pagC127 , pagC325 , pagC503 , pagC407 , and pagC673 was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers JG395 -- JG396 , WPL13 -- JG14 , WPL13 -- JG12 , WPL13 -- JG24 , WPL13 -- JG381 , and WPL13 -- JG13 , respectively . 
The primers were designed with EcoRI and KpnI sites at the 50 end . 
The yciG fragment was cloned into the ﬁreﬂy luciferase-reporter suicide vector pGPL01 [ 16 ] . 
Recombination of this construct with yciG on th chromosome created a gene fusion and a polar insertion in the yciG-containing operon . 
The pagC127 , pagC325 , pagC503 , pagC407 , and pagC673 promoter fragments were cloned into the ﬁreﬂy luciferase-reporter suicide vector pLB02 [ 17 ] . 
Recombination on the chromosome created a gene fusion in which the strain became mer-odiploid for the pagC407 promoter region . 
DNA for pagC , pagD , and pmrD was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers WPL13 -- JG388 , JG384 -- JG389 , and JG177 -- JG390 , respectively . 
The primers were designed with EcoRI and BamHI sites at the 50 end . 
The pagC , pagD , and pmrD promoter fragments were cloned into the b-galactosidase-reporter vector pRS551 [ 18 ] . 
Linearized pRS551 with the promoter fragments was recombined onto the chromosome of ATCC14028s at the putPA locus as previously described , creating a gene fusion in which the strains became merodiploid for the pagC , pagD , and pmrD promoter fragments [ 19 ] . 
Deletion of rpoS was accomplished by means of the k red-mediated site-speciﬁc recombination as described by Datsenko and Wanner using primers JG413 -- JG414 [ 20 ] . 
Colonies were characterized by PCR using primers speciﬁc to DNA regions outside of the deletion . 
The promoter of yciG was ampliﬁed using primers JG395 -- JG396 and cloned into the EcoRI -- KpnI sites of pGPL01 . 
Upon mating into a wild-type S. typhimurium background , P22HT-int transduction was used to move the yciG : : luc gene fusion into the rpoS : : FRT deletion strain . 
Strains JSG1741 , JSG1742 , and JSG1743 were created by using P22HT-int transduction , in which the mutations from a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 wild-type background were transduced into the ATCC14028s background strain . 
2.3. Transcriptional assays
Strains carrying yciG : : luc were grown to log phase in LB broth and incubated for 1 h with or without 6 % bile . 
Strains with pagC127-673 : : luc promoter fragments were grown to log phase in LB broth and incubated for 1 h with or without 3 % bile . 
Cultures were washed 2 in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and ﬁreﬂy luciferase assays were performed as previously described [ 16 ] . 
2.4. Two-dimensional gel assays
Wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was grown overnight at 37 C with aeration in LB broth , or LB broth plus 3 % bile or 15 % bile , washed , and pelleted . 
The whole cells were lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) boiling buffer and the extracts were separated on 2-D ( SDS ) -- polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis gels by Kendrick Labs [ 21 ] . 
At least two gels were run from different samples at each bile concentration , with each gel showing the identical bile-regu-lated protein spots . 
Protein spots of interest were excised from the gels by Kendrick Labs and sent to Columbia University Howard Hughes Medical Institute Protein Chemistry Core facility for peptide mass mapping [ 22,23 ] . 
Brieﬂy , the proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser de-sorption ionization ( MALDI ) mass spectrometry . 
The peptide masses obtained by mass spectrometry were entered into search programs , which scan databases , such as NCBI or TIGR , to ﬁnd signiﬁcant matches . 
Numerous peptide matches with signiﬁcant protein coverage were identiﬁed for each spot under examination , leading to full conﬁdence in the protein identiﬁcation . 
2.5. RNA isolation, labeling, and hybridization
JSG210 was grown in LB broth at 37 C with aeration to an OD600 of 0.25 . 
Cultures were then incubated in LB broth with or without 3 % bile . 
Samples were collected at 30 and 60 min after the addition of bile . 
Cells from each sample were pelleted and resuspended in 100 ll of 400 lg/ml of lysozyme in Tris -- EDTA buffer . 
RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer 's instruction using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen Inc , Valencia , CA ) . 
An optional on-column DNase treatment for 1 h was also performed according to the manufacturer 's instruction . 
cDNA was synthesized from the RNA with pd ( N ) 6 Random Hexamer ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 as previously described [ 24 ] . 
Labeled cDNA was hybridized to DNA microarrays generated from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 to compare samples grown with or without bile collected at the same timepoint [ 25 ] . 
Labeling and hybridization were repeated three times for each time point . 
Hybridized slides were scanned and analyzed with a Gene Pix Scanner 4000A and the GENEPIX program ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA ) . 
2.6. Data analysis
Data was analyzed with the Stanford University Microarray Database , Microsoft Excel and the signiﬁcance analysis for microarrays ( SAM ) program ( http://wwwstat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html ) [ 26 ] . 
Three hybridizations from each time point were grouped in an experimental set and were ﬁltered by the Stanford Microarray Database according to their mean log2 -- ( Cy5 / Cy3 ) ratios . 
Initial ﬁltering criteria required that at least 80 % of the data from a particular spot over three replicate experiments had a regression correlation of 0.6 . 
Data were additionally ﬁltered using Cluster software to remove any genes with missing values in greater than 20 % of the columns and those that have standard deviations less than 2 . 
SAM calculates a list of signiﬁcan genes and a false discovery rate , which is an estimate of the percentage of false positives . 
To determine if a common theme was present in the list of signiﬁcant genes , a lexical analysis using LACK software ( http : / / falkow.stanford.edu/whatwedo/software , script available as Windows executable or source ﬁle ) was utilized . 
A list of common terms associated with the theme being examined were imputed into a ﬁle . 
The program searched the signiﬁcant gene list for the presence of the terms entered . 
At random , the program also sampled the complete genome annotation for the number of times the terms entered appeared in the entire array list . 
The output ﬁle allowed us an unbiased statistical method for determining if a certain theme , such as invasion , was over-represented in the list of signiﬁcant genes . 
Data from all arrays used in this paper are available at http : / / genome-www . 
stanford.edu/microarray . 
2.7. Motility assays
Motility was measured by tracking the swimming of individual bacteria using a digital video camera attached to an Olympus BX60 phase-contrast microscope [ 27 ] . 
Brieﬂy , overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown to logarithmic phase in LB broth with shaking at 250 rpm at 37 C. Cultures were then grown for one additional hour with or without 3 % bile with shaking at 250 rpm at 37 C . 
The cultures were then diluted 1:100 and mounted between a microscope slide and a coverslip , and several ﬁelds were analyzed under the microscope . 
The motion and path of the bacteria were recorded on a Canon Elura 40MC digital video camcorder ( Canon Inc. . 
Japan ) . 
A total of ca. 5 min of video imagery from two separate ﬁelds of view was acquired for each strain . 
A 1-min segment of each acquired ﬁeld of view was captured to a computer hard disk using Adobe Premiere ( Adobe Systems Inc. . 
San Jose , CA ) . 
Still images were taken from this digital ﬁle every 0.33 s and exported to Adobe Photoshop as separate TIFF ﬁles . 
The TIFF ﬁles , in conjunction with the original digital video ﬁle , were subsequently used to locate and measure the position of cells by recording their pixel coordinates . 
Individual cells were tracked across nine consecutive TIFF ﬁles for a total of 2.66 s and the coordinates recorded . 
The coordinates of each tracked cell were entered into a spreadsheet ( Excel , Microsoft Corp. . 
Seattle , WA ) , from which estimates of the average velocity and tumble frequency were derived for each track . 
Motility was scored as the distance in micrometers covered per bacterium per second of video recording , while tumbles were assessed as a deviation in angle of direction of greater than 45 from the preceding time segment . 
For each strain , the motility represents the average of 20 bacteria per sample . 
The validity of data was assessed using P values as calculated using Student 's t-test . 
3. Results and discussion
3.1 . 
Bile repression of pagC is dependent upon a 97-bp region of the leader sequence 
Two-dimensional ( 2-D ) gel electrophoresis was performed on whole cell extracts from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in LB broth alone , 3 % bile or 15 % bile . 
Previously , > 15 protein spots were shown to be altered by growth in the presence of bile [ 8 ] . 
Proteins that exhibited a signiﬁcant , repeatable change , either increased or decreased levels , were excised from the gel , exposed to trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry . 
Database searches were used to identify potential mat-ches . 
Five protein spots were analyzed , resulting in matches to PagC , OmpD , and FljB ( which were all repressed by bile ) , and YciF and a hypothetical membrane protein STM4242 ( which were both activated by bile ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Transcriptional analysis of ompD and STM4242 did not demonstrate bile regulation , suggesting an effect at the posttranscriptional level ( data not shown ) . 
ompD , which is absent in the genome of S. enterica seovar Typhi , and STM4242 were not analyzed further in this study . 
PagC is a PhoP/PhoQ-regulated outer membrane protein with no currently assigned function , although it is associated with virulence [ 28,29 ] . 
It shows high homology to OmpX from Escherichia coli , Ail from Yer-sinia enterocolitica , and Lom from bacteriophage lambda [ 30 -- 35 ] . 
Transcriptional activity of pagC was measured to examine if the decrease in protein level in the presence of bile was due to repression of transcription . 
Transcriptional assays demonstrated a 2.5 - to 3-fold decrease in activity in the presence of bile ( Fig. 2 ) . 
These results support the data from the 2-D gel electrophoresis and demonstrate that bile represses pagC transcription . 
Because PhoP/PhoQ regulates more than 40 genes , additional PhoP/PhoQ-activated genes , including pmrD and pagD , were examined to determine if bile speciﬁcally regulated pagC , or if it has a general effect on PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes . 
The results establish that other PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes were unaffected by the presence of bile ( as exempliﬁed by pagD and pmrD , Fig. 2 ) , suggesting that pagC is speciﬁcally affected by bile . 
pagC has a 558-bp untranslated leader sequence between the promoter and the translational start site [ 36 ] . 
It has been suggested that the leader sequence may be a pseudogene , or possibly required for RNA stability ( J.S. Gunn , unpublished results ) . 
To determine if the leader sequence was required for bile-mediated repression , fragments including the promoter and 127 , 305 , 407 , 503 , or 673 bp of the leader sequence were cloned into a suicide ﬁreﬂy luciferase vector and recombined onto the chromosome ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The vector containing 673-bp of sequence includes the full-length leader region and short segment of the pagC gene downstream of the translational start site and is representative of the natural promoter and untranslated leader regions ( Fig. 3 ) . 
PhoP exerts its effect on this promoter near the 50 end of this 673-bp fragment upstream of the untranslated leader . 
Examination of the strains containing the promoter fragments in the presence and absence of bile established that a region of 97-bp located at position ) 173 to ) 269 with respect to the translational start site was required for full-transcriptional activity ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The data also suggest that bile does not necessarily repress pagC transcription , but prevents activation of transcription from occurring . 
Perhaps bile salts prevent binding of a transcriptional activator by either binding to the activator itself or by binding to the DNA within the leader sequence to competitively inhibit binding of the regulator . 
Interestingly , the same region upstream of the pagC translational start has been implicated in binding of the transcriptional regulatory protein SlyA ( J. Gunn and

Luciferase activity measured from the pagC673 promoter fragment , which represents the natural promoter and full , untranslated region , was compared to fragments containing the promoter and various lengths of the untranslated region .

While the precise function of pagC is unknown , it does appear to affect virulence [ 28 ] . 
A similar protein , Ail , is required for invasion and serum resistance [ 37 ] . 
It is possible that the expression of pagC in the presence of bile is detrimental to Salmonella spp . 
viability , possibly due to the involvement ( direct or peripheral ) of this protein in bile transport . 
We are currently investigating this hypothesis . 
3.2. Bile activates yciF independently of RpoS
The abundance of a second protein from the 2-D gels was observed to increase in the presence of bile and this protein was identiﬁed as YciF ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The gene encoding YciF is predicted to be the second gene in the yciGFE-katN operon [ 38 ] . 
The functions of yciG and yciF are unknown [ 38,39 ] , but yciE encodes for an acid shock protein and katN encodes for a non-heme catalase [ 38 ] . 
yciF was initially identiﬁed by a screen for RpoSregulated genes and a putative RpoS-dependent promoter has been located upstream of yciG [ 39 ] . 
To determine if the change in protein levels of yciF was due to transcriptional activation of yciGFE-katN by bile , a transcriptional fusion to yciG was constructed . 
The results demonstrate a 3-fold increase in transcriptional activity of yciG : : luc in the presence of 6 % bile ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Interestingly , 3 % bile did not activate transcription of yciG , suggesting that this operon may play a role in adapting the cell to more stressful conditions ( data not shown ) . 
Growth of the strain containing the yciG : : luc polar insertion was not affected in the presence of bile , demonstrating that yciGFE-katN op-eron was not necessary for bile resistance ( Fig. 4 , data not shown ) . 
Because yciF was identiﬁed in a screen for RpoSregulated genes , we examined transcription of yciG : : luc with and without RpoS to determine if activation of yciGFE-katN by bile was dependent upon RpoS . 
These data show that bile-mediated activation of yciG still occurred in the absence of RpoS ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Also , contradictory to previous ﬁndings , we observed that transcriptional activity of yciG was not dependent upon RpoS , as luciferase activity of the yciG : : luc fusion was not decreased in a DrpoS background ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The role for bile activation of yciGFE-katN is currently unclear . 
However , the functions of yciE and katN , as well as the possible regulation of this operon under certain conditions by RpoS , suggest that this operon may play a role in stress response , possibly including repairs due to the effect of bile salts on the bacterium . 
3.3 . 
Microarray data corroborates previous ﬁndings that bile represses invasion 
In Salmonella spp. , genes required for type III secretion ( TTS ) - mediated invasion of epithelial cells are located within pathogenicity island I [ 40,41 ] . 
The genes form a hierarchy , which regulates the formation of the TTS apparatus and production of effector molecules required for induced uptake by epithelial cells [ 40 ] . 
We previously reported that bile represses transcription of the genes within the invasion hierarchy , which led to a reduction in secreted effectors and consequently , decreased invasion of epithelial cells [ 6 ] . 
In the current study , we used Salmonella DNA microarrays to identify changes in gene expression when S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was exposed to 3 % bile for 30 and 60 min . 
The array data were ﬁrst analyzed by hierarchical clustering to identify genes that were either repressed or induced by bile . 
These data showed 230 genes to be > 3-fold affected by bile . 
Of these 230 genes , 101 were activated in the presence of bile while 129 were repressed . 
The LACK PERL script [ 42 ] was then utilized to determine whether particular keywords were over-repre-sented in the list of induced or repressed genes . 
LACK uses statistical analysis to compare the frequency of occurrence of a particular group of keywords ( input by the user ) within the list of induced or repressed genes , with the frequency of the same group of words within a list of randomly generated genes . 
Based on analysis of the DNA microarray by LACK , gene descriptions containing the word `` invasion '' were over-represented in the group of bile-repressed genes , suggesting that a signiﬁcant proportion of invasion genes were repressed in the presence of bile ( data not shown ) . 
This ﬁnding corroborated our previously published data demonstrating that bile represses the transcription of genes within the invasion pathway [ 6 ]

Salmonellae show reduced expression of ﬂagellar biosynthesis genes and reduced motility in the presence of bile 
Many bacteria exhibit motility by means of ﬂagella , which can also be used for attachment , such as in bio-ﬁlms [ 13,43 -- 46 ] . 
Expression of genes involved in ﬂagellar biosynthesis is complex and regulation is organized into a tightly controlled hierarchy [ 43 ] . 
Salmonella spp . 
have over 50 genes involved in ﬂagellar synthesis organized into at least 15 operons in three hierarchical classes [ 43 ] . 
Transcription of class II is dependent upon expression of class I and class III is dependent upon expression of class II [ 43 ] . 
Our analysis of the 2-D gel electrophoretic patterns with and without bile showed a signiﬁcant bile-mediated decrease in the abundance of FljB ( Fig. 1 ) , one of two antigenically distinct ﬂagellins expressed by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 47 ] . 
From the microarray , genes involved in ﬂagellar biosynthesis ( search terms `` ﬂagella '' or `` motility '' ) were shown to be over-represented in the population of bile-repressed genes on the DNA microarray . 
While ﬂiD ( 6.6-fold ) appeared as the most regulated ﬂagellar-related gene in the microarrays , regulation of the majority of ﬂagellar-related genes in the microarray ranged from 3.9-fold to our cutoff value of 2.0 . 
These data supported the hypothesis that bile downregulates transcription of genes within the ﬂagellar hierarchy leading to a decrease in the amount of ﬂagella ( data not shown ) . 
To directly examine ﬂagellar gene transcription , b-galactosidase assays with and without bile were performed with strains containing MudJ fusions to ﬂhC , ﬂgC , and ﬂiC , representative genes for class I , II , and III , respectively . 
The results demonstrate a decrease in transcription in the range 26 -- 49 % for all three classes ( Fig. 5 ) . 
These results suggest that bile downregulates ﬂagellar expression at a transcription le-vel . 
The observed regulation , while moderate , may affect ﬂagellation and motility , as it has been shown in Esch-erichia coli that even a 2-fold repression in transcription of genes within the ﬂagellar hierarchy can produce non-ﬂagellated cells [ 48 ] . 
It is also possible that post-tran-scriptional regulation , which was not examined , may account for some of the regulation of ﬂagellar protein expression . 
To determine if the observed regulation by bile results in a decrease in motility , individual bacteria were tracked , and mean distance traveled , mean velocity , and tumble frequency were calculated for bacteria in LB broth alone or with bile . 
The bacteria exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in mean distance traveled and mean velocity in the presence of bile ( Table 1 ) . 
An increase in tumbling frequency was observed but could not be considered statistically signiﬁcant . 
These results corroborate regulation observed on 2-D gels and DNA microarrays , and demonstrate that salmonellae are less motile ( but not amotile ) in bile . 
Bile has also been demonstrated to regulate motility in V. cholerae , but bile appears to increase motility of this organism [ 4 ] . 
Since S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ﬂagellar mutants are competent for epithelial cell invasion and ﬂhD mutants are still fully virulent in mice [ 49 ] , bile-mediated repression of motility may be energetically favorable upon entrance into the intestines of a host . 
In this study , two techniques , 2-D gel electrophoresis and DNA microarrays , were utilized to analyze the effect of bile on regulation in the whole cell without using mutagenesis , which could have unrelated effects on the bacteria . 
In this report , we provide data that implicates bile as an important environmental signal for genetic regulation in the salmonellae . 
Because many different pathways that do not appear to have any direct interactions with one another are similarly affected by bile , it is likely that bile is an environmental cue that indicates the presence of a host environment , and participates with other host-speciﬁc signals to trigger appropriate expression of genes required for pathogenesis .
