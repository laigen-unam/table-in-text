Abstract 
DNA-looping mediated by regulatory proteins is a ubiquitous mode of transcriptional control that allows interactions between genetic elements separated over long distances in DNA . 
In prokar-yotes , one of the best-studied examples of regulatory proteins that use DNA-looping is the NtrC family of enhancer-binding proteins ( EBPs ) , which activate transcription from sN - ( sigma-N , sigma-54 ) dependent promoters . 
The completely sequenced genome of food-borne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 contains seven novel EBPs of unknown function . 
Four of these EBPs have a similar domain organisation to NtrC whilst surprisingly the remaining three resemble LevR in Bacillus subtilis . 
Probable transcriptional targets are identiﬁed for each of the EBPs , including novel homologues of phosphotransferase system Enzyme II ( EII ) and several virulenceassociated functions . 
Comparisons are made with the related enteric bacteria Salmonella Typhi , Escherichia coli and Yersinia pestis .

Introduction
DNA-looping , mediated by regulatory proteins , is a ubiquitous mode of transcriptional control that allows interactions between genetic elements separated over long distances in DNA ( Rippe et al. , 1995 ; Xu and Hoover , 2001 ) . 
Generally , a protein bound to one genetic element some distance from a target gene interacts with another protein ( or protein complex ) associated with the promoter , thereby causing transcriptional activation or ( occasionally ) repression . 
One advantage of this type of regulation is that large macromolecular complexes can be pre-assembled at the promoter in readiness for activation by another protein that binds elsewhere , thereby increasing response efﬁciency .

Enhancer-Binding Proteins (EBPs) in Bacteria
In prokaryotes , one of the best-studied examples of regulatory proteins that use DNA-looping is the NtrC family of enhancer-binding proteins ( EBPs ) . 
Binding of the activated form of an EBP to its target sequence and DNA-looping place it in contact with a special form of RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) containing the sN subunit ( Buck et al. , 2000 ; Rombel et al. , 1998 ) . 
Sigma factors ( s ) are subunits of RNAP that are required for promoter recognition and initiation of transcription . 
Among them N s is unique ( Merrick , 1993 ) in that it confers upon RNAP the requirement for activation by an EBP . 
Nucleotide-hydrolysis , catalysed by the EBP , drives the formation of an open transcription complex and hence activates expression of the target gene . 
Members of the NtrC family of EBPs have a modular domain organisation ( Morett and Segovia , 1993 ) . 
The middle domain is around 240 amino acids in length and contains seven highly conserved motifs including two ATP-binding motifs ( Walker motifs A and B ) and is responsible for nucleotide-hydrolysis and interaction with sN-RNAP . 
This central domain belongs to the AAA + protein family ( Neuwald et al. , 1999 ) and may adopt a similar fold to that of other nucleotide-binding and hydrolysing proteins . 
The C-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is required for binding DNA . 
The N-terminus is the most variable domain and is absent in some EBPs . 
Its function is to receive sensory input , in the form of a phosphoryl-transfer or direct protein-protein interaction , and to modulate the transcriptional activation activity of the central domain . 
Recently there have been exciting developments in elucidating the molecular mechanism of enhancer-dependent transcription ( e.g. Chaney et al. , 2001 ) ; but our understanding of the evolutionary origin and biological signiﬁcance of this mode of regulation in bacteria still lags behind . 
The availability of complete genome sequences allows us to analyse the complete complement of proteins synthesised within the cell . 
Inspection of the numerous microbial genome sequences now available indicates that diverse NtrC-like proteins ( paralogues ) are present in many organisms studied to date ( Studholme & Buck , 2000 ) . 
However , few of these have been characterised and , for the most part , their target genes are unknown . 
In those cases where the paralogous systems have been investigated , it appears that target genes are usually involved in adaptive responses allowing survival in hostile environments . 
For example , cellular functions dependent on

The properties of the sN-RNAP/EBP system represent a highly sophisticated mode of transcriptional regulation ( Buck et al. , 2000 ) but at a cost ; the looping mechanism of activator-RNAP contact requires large stretches of intergenic DNA . 
In bacteria , which have very compact genomes with little intergenic spacing , there is presumably a trade-off between the advantages of the DNA-looping mechanism and the evolutionary constraints on genome size . 
Therefore it is instructive to ask how many , and what type of functions are regulated in this way in different bacteria .

Enhancer-Dependent Transcription in S. typhimurium LT2
Salmonella enterica subspecies I , serovar Typhimur-ium ( S. typhimurium ) is a major cause of human gastro-enteritis and causes typhoid-like symptoms in mice . 
Inspection of the recently sequenced S. typhi-murium LT2 genome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) reveals that it encodes 14 protein sequences that contain all of the characteristic motifs of a sN-dependent EBP ( Table 1 ) . 
Seven of these proteins have been well studied in Salmonella or E. coli : RtcR , NtrC , HydG , FhlA , PgtA , PspF and PrpR . 
The transcriptional targets of the remaining 7 EBPs are currently unknown . 
However , two well-established characteristics of EBPs enable us to make some predictions . 
Firstly , all of the bacterial EBPs studied so far transactivate their targets through direct interaction with sN-RNAP ( Buck et al. , 2000 ; Xu and Hoover , 2001 ) . 
Therefore each transcriptional target of an EBP must be linked to a sN-RNAP-binding DNA sequence . 
Binding sites for sN-RNAP are fairly easy to detect a n d h a v e t h e c o n s e n s u s s e q u e n c e Y T G GCACGrNNNTTGCW ( Barrios et al. , 1999 ) . 
Secondly , the ORF encoding an EBP is almost invariably sited close ( within a few kilobases ) to one or more of its targets ( e.g. Ledebur et al. , 1990 ; Genschik et al. , 1998 ; Model et al. , 1997 ; Marques et al. , 1998 ; Palacios and Escalante-Semerena , 2000 ; Leonhartsberger et al. , 2001 ) . 
Nevertheless , there may be additional targets at distant sites in the genome . 
Therefore I searched the complete genome sequence of S. typhimurium LT2 for potential sN-RNAP-binding sites ( Table 2 ) using the PromScan computer program ( http :\ \ www.promscan . 
uklinux.net \ index.htm ) . 
The algorithm assumes a probabilistic model and assigns a score to potential binding sites . 
This score , known as the Kullback-Liebler distance , reﬂects the theoretical binding energy of the DNA-protein interaction ( Stormo , 2000 ) . 
Interestingly , close to all of the EBP-encoding genes there are high-scoring sites , providing strong clues as to the EBPs ' targets ( Figure 1 ) . 
The probable targets of each of the novel EBPs are discussed in the following sections .

YgaA and YfhA
Two of the uncharacterised EBP-encoding genes in Salmonella , ygaA and yfhA , have orthologues in E. coli K12 . 
YgaA is homologous to the nitric oxide reductase regulator NorR in Ralstonia eutropha and Gardner et al. ( 2002 ) recently showed that the orthologues of STM2840 and YgbD in E. coli are components of a nitric oxide detoxiﬁcation system and that mutation of ygaA eliminates inducible anaerobic nitric oxide metabolism . 
Therefore , YgaG probably activates transcription of this nitric oxide detoxiﬁcation system ( Figure 1A ) . 
The sequence of the N-terminal domain of the YfhA gene-product resembles a receiver domain of the classical two-component signal transduction system ( Stock et al. , 2000 ) and the nearby gene yfhK encodes a histidine kinase sensor protein . 
Thus it appears that yfhKGA speciﬁes an auto-activating two component signal transduction system linked to yfhG , a gene of unknown function ( Figure 1B ) . 
STM0652 and STM2361
Two further EBPs in S. typhimurium LT2 have no orthologues in E. coli , but are present in S. serovar Typhi . 
STM0652 appears to activate transcription of a putative altronate hydrolase of unknown function encoded by STM0649 and STM0650 . 
Immediately downstream is STM0651 encoding a 2-keto-3-deoxy gluconate permease . 
Therefore it is likely that this gene cluster is involved in utilisation of sugar acids ( hexuronates ) . 
STM2361 lies adjacent to a cluster of genes implicated in amino acid transport ( Figure 1D ) including argT , which encodes the periplasmic lysine-arginine-ornithine binding protein ( Schmitz et al. , 1988 ; Kustu et al. , 1979 ) . 
Although argT is controlled by nitrogen status through a sN-dependent promoter , there are no nearby binding sites for the general nitrogen control protein NtrC ( Schmitz et al. , 1988 ; Wu et al. , 1999 ) . 
Therefore , presumably an alternative EBP is required to activate this sN-dependent promoter . 
The most likely candidate is STM2361 , its gene being immediately adjacent to this cluster of amino acid transport genes . 
Whether there is a regulatory link between the classical Ntr nitrogen control system and STM2361 remains to be investigated . 
STM2361 has a PAS domain at its N-terminus . 
It is conceivable that in Salmonella STM2361 represents a second nitrogen-responsive transcriptional activator in addition to NtrC but it is very unlikely that STM2361 directly senses nitrogen-status ; PAS domains are found in a variety of signal transduction proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes where they have been implicated in sensing of redox , oxygen and light but there is no evidence that they can sense nitrogen ( Taylor and Zhulin , 1999 ) .

Novel EBPs and the Phosphoenolpyruvate- Dependent Phosphotransferase Systems (PTS)
The remaining three EBPs in S. typhimurium LT2 ( Figure 1E , F , G ) are associated with genes resembling Enzyme II ( EII ) components of the phosphoenolpyr-uvate-dependent phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) . 
The classical phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransfer system ( PTS ) of E. coli carries out the fundamental process of substrate level phosphorylation , whereby the transport and activation of sugar substrates are thermodynamically coupled to depho-sphorylation of the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate . 
The phosphoryl relay proceeds sequentially from PEP to Enzyme I , HPr , Enzyme II ( EII ) and ﬁnally to the incoming sugar that is transported across the membrane and concomitantly phosphorylated by EII . 
Additionally , PTS components participate in signal transduction , chemotaxis , and the regulation of some key physiological processes e.g. carbohydrate transport , catabolite repression , carbon storage and co-ordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism ( Postma et al. , 1993 ; Reizer and Saier. , 1997 ; Saier and Reizer , 1994 ; Siebold et al. , 2001 ; Tchieu et al. , 2001 ) . 
Homologues of PTS-components have previously been implicated in modulating the transcriptional activity of sN-RNAP ( e.g. Merrick and Coppard , 1989 ) , a link possibly allowing coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism . 
However , the identiﬁcation of sN-dependent promoters upstream of PTS EII homologues reveals a further novel and unanticipated link between these two crucial regulatory mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria . 
Strikingly , examination of their sequences reveals that STM0571 , STM3773 and 
STM4534 are similar to the LevR-type of EBP in Gram-positive bacteria . 
These proteins contain three domains , but are quite distinct from the NtrC-like EBPs . 
Domain A is similar to the central domain of NtrC-like EBPs whereas domains B and C are similar to the BglG family of antiterminators and each contains a phosphor-ylatable histidinyl residue ( Debarouille et al. , 1991 ) . 
Phosphorylation of the histidinyl residue located in domain B of LevR ( by the general PTS component Hpr ) stimulates transactivation of the levanase operon . 
In contrast , a PTS-like component encoded in the levanase operon phosphorylates the domain C histidinyl residue , suppressing transactivation . 
This allows sophisticated ﬁne-tuning of gene regulation and integration of two different signals ( Martin-Verstraete et al. , 1998 ) . 
The Salmonella EBPs share about 30 % amino acid sequence identity with LevR , and the critical histidinyl residues are conserved . 
Thus it is probable that they operate by a similar mechanism . 
The links between the EBPs and the PTS-like transport systems in Salmonella suggest a feedback loop whereby an activated EBP induces the expression of the PTS-like components that in turn may phosphorylate the cognate EBP to modulate its activity . 
Moreover , both systems are likely to regulate a number of additional targets . 
However , none of these targets has yet been identiﬁed . 
LevR-like sequences have been described in the Gram-positive Clostridium acetobutylicum ( Nolling et al. , 2001 ) , Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua ( Glaser et al. , 2001 ) . 
In Enterococcus faecalis ( He-chard et al. , 2001 ) ﬁve different LevR-like proteins each activate transcription of PTS EII components ( Hechard et al. , 2001 ) . 
LevR-homologues have not previously been reported in Gram-negative bacteria and are absent in E. coli , Yersinia pestis , S. Typhi and all the Gram-negative organisms whose genomes have been fully sequenced . 
However , BLAST searches against unﬁnished genome sequences reveal LevR-like sequences in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis and Dublin and the closely related Klebsiella pneumoniae . 
Thus although common in low-GC Grampositive bacteria , these three PTS-EBP gene clusters , reminiscent of the B. subtilis levanase operon , are something of a novelty in a Gram-negative bacterium . 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Salmonella LevR-like EBPs did not form a discrete clade ( Figure 2 ) and therefore probably did not arise from duplications within Salmonella but rather by several lateral transfer events . 
The biological signiﬁcance of this intertwining of the sN - and PTS-regulons in S. typhimurium is as yet unknown but may be related to its lifestyle as a host-generalist food-borne pathogen also able to live outside the host . 
Indeed the three LevR-like EBPs are not found in the closely related S.typhi , which is largely restricted to human hosts . 
Several high-scoring potential sN-binding sites identi-ﬁed in S. typhimurium LT2 are not sited close to genes encoding EBPs and have not been shown to be associated with any particular EBP ( Table 2A ) . 
If indee sN-RNAP binds to these sites then they may represent genuine promoters . 
If they are genuine promoters , then transcription must be activated by an EBP either bound to a nearby enhancer element or from solution . 
It has been demonstrated that some EBPs can activate transcription from sN-RNAP binding sites even in the absence of enhancers ( e.g. Leonhartsberger et al. , 2001 ) , although the physiological signiﬁcance of this is unclear . 
Alternatively , sN-RNAP binding sites may act as negative regulatory elements , as is the case for the negatively autoregulated rpoN gene in Pseudomonas putida ( Köhler et al. , 1994 ) . 
Pallen ( 1999 ) ﬁrst noticed a potential sN-RNAP binding site upstream of rpoH ( encoding the heat shock sigma factor sH ) in E. coli , and it is conserved in Salmonella . 
This sequence is very similar to the consensus of Barrios et al. ( 1999 ) and would be expected to bind sN-RNAP strongly . 
In E. coli growing on nutrient-poor media , deletion of the rpoN gene ( encoding sN ) led to loss of transcription from the sH-dependent ibpAB promoter ( Kucyńska - Wisńik et al. , 2001 ) , further suggesting that sHmay be dependent on sN under certain conditions . 
There is a strong potential sN-RNAP-binding site upstream of topA , encoding topoisomerase I , which is required for temperature-dependent transcriptional regulation and for thermotolerance in several bacteria ( Tse-Dinh et al. , 1997 ) . 
Four topA promoters have been previously identiﬁed , one of which is dependent on sH . 
Whether topA is additionally regulated by sN-RNAP , and under what conditions , remains to be tested . 
Nevertheless these observations , along with the established role of sN-RNAP in regulating the pspABCDE and ipbAB heat shock operons ( Model et al. , 1997 ; Kucynska-Wisnik et al. , 2001 ) , may indicate intimate links between the heat shock and enhancer-dependent regulons . 
The YeaG gene-product resembles Bacillus subtilis protein kinase PrkA , which phosphorylates an unidentiﬁed 60kDa protein in B. subtilis . 
PrkA was discovered during a screen of a B. subtilis genomic library for genes that would interact with the PTS . 
However , interaction with PTS was dependent on an adjacent ORF immediately upstream rather than on prkA itself ( Fischer et al. , 1995 ) . 
Nevertheless this suggests yet another possible link between the sN regulon and the PTS in Salmonella . 
In Salmonella , cspB encodes a small DNA-binding cold-shock protein , CspB . 
In S. typhimurium cells grown at 10 ! 
C , Craig et al. ( 1998 ) found a singl transcriptional start site upstream of cspB . 
However , it is still possible that the potential sN-RNAP binding site identiﬁed here is functional under some other conditions . 
In Pseudomonas aeruginosa , PA0961 , encoding a protein 54 % identical to CspB , is also preceded by a sN potential - RNAP ( unpublished results ) lending further support for biological signiﬁcance . 
Several of the potential sN-dependent promoters are associated with virulence factors in Salmonella . 
The sN-dependent psp operon , activated by PspF , is involved in virulence in Y. enterocolitica , pspC being required for normal growth when the Ysc type III secretion system was expressed in the laboratory ( Darwin and Miller , 2001 ) . 
The psp operon is conserved in Salmonella . 
It remains to be tested whether pspC is required for activity of the two type III secretion systems in S. typhimurium . 
Other genes implicated in Salmonella virulence that have potential sN-dependent promoters include clpP ( Yamamoto et al. , 2001 ) , yrdA ( encoding a siderophore-binding protein ) and pagK ( Gunn et al. , 1998 ) . 
Furthermore , acrD , encoding a multidrug resistance protein ( Nishino et al. , 2001 ) and STM2690 , encoding an outer membrane efﬂux pump , have potential sN-dependent promoters . 
It would therefore be interesting to test whether deletion of the Salmonella rpoN gene had any effect on virulence as it does , for example , in P. aeruginosa ( Hendrickson et al. , 2001 ) .

Concluding Remarks
Complete genome sequences are the starting point for an integrative approach towards understanding how genes and molecules are networked to form a biological system . 
However , while sequence data are accumulating rapidly , our current knowledge of biology constitutes only a small fraction of what remains to be discovered . 
Therefore , we are increasingly forced to rely on induction and inference to build models from existing data . 
In this paper I have shown how such deductive methods can take us some way towards understanding the ` wiring diagram ' of a genetic regulatory network in a food-borne pathogen , S. typhimurium , that involves DNA-looping . 
The sN-dependent regulon in S. typhimurium includes knowngenes for assimilation of ammonia and amino acids , RNA-processing , tolerance to lead and zinc , formatehydrogenlyase , phosphoglycerate utilisation , the heat / phage shock response , and propionate metabolism . 
Novel members of the regulon proposed here include a two component signal transduction system , hexuronate utilisation , an uncharacterised oxidoreductase system , ClpP protease , and three PTS EII components . 
The N repertoire of functions regulated by s - RNAP varies signiﬁcantly even between quite closely related bacteria ( Table 1 ) suggesting that this regulon is actively subject to natural selection and/or horizontal transfer events . 
Between more distantly related bacteria the differences are even greater ( Studholme and Buck , 2000 ) . 
Of course predictions derived from in silico surveys such as this are prone to errors ( see Cases and de Lorenzo , 2001 ) . 
However , this approach has already generated hypotheses that were subsequently conﬁrmed by laboratory-based experiments ( Matthews and Timms , 2000 ; Hübner et al. , 2001 ) and provides a framework for future investigations .
