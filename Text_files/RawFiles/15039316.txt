Salmonellae are facultative intracellular bacteria capable of surviving within macrophages . 
Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI-2 ) is required for growth within macrophages and for virulence in mice . 
In this study , we show the involvement of SPI-2 in a signal transduction pathway that induces cytokine expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
High levels of interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) mRNA were induced in macrophages by infection with wild-type salmonellae compared to a strain carrying a mutation in the spiC gene , which is encoded within SPI-2 . 
The two strains had the same effect on the expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1 , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha . 
IL-10 expression was dose dependently blocked by treatment of infected macrophages with the protein kinase A ( PKA ) inhibitor H-89 , while IL-10 expression was increased by the PKA activator dibutyryl cyclic AMP . 
Cyclic AMP-dependent PKA activity was higher in macrophages infected with wild-type salmonellae compared to the spiC mutant , and Ser132 phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) , which is an important mediator of PKA activation , correlated with the levels of PKA activity . 
Taken together , these results indicate that salmonellae cause an SPI-2-dependent increase in PKA activity that leads to CREB phosphorylation , resulting in up-regulation of IL-10 expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
Suppression of IL-10 expression by an antisense oligonucleotide did not affect the growth of wild-type salmonellae within macrophages , whereas growth was dose dependently inhibited by H-89 , suggesting that the PKA signaling pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in intramacrophage Salmonella survival . 
( M cells ) in the host 's intestine ; migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes , where they encounter macrophages ; and subsequently survive and replicate within infected macrophages . 
Speciﬁc virulence factors encoded within Salmonella pathoge-nicity islands ( SPI ) are required at various stages of Salmonella infection ( 23 ) . 
SPI-1 , located at centisome 63 on the Salmo-nella enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosome , is required for salmonellae to enter epithelial cells ( 18 , 19 ) and to promote apoptosis in macrophages ( 26 ) . 
In addition , Hobbie et al. ( 27 ) reported that proteins secreted by the type III secretion system encoded within SPI-1 can trigger host cell signal transduction pathways that activate transcription factors NF - B and AP1 . 
This activation induces production of proinﬂammatory cyto-kines such as IL-8 , which are presumably important in the inﬂammatory diarrhea that follows Salmonella infection . 
SPI-2 , which is a 40-kb pathogenicity island located at centisome 30.7 on the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosome , is required for the ability to grow within mammalian cells , such as macrophages or epithelial cells , and is required for virulence in mice ( 11 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 35 , 45 ) . 
Previous work showed that a mutant defective in the spiC gene , which lies adjacent to the spiR ( ssrA ) / ssrB two-component regulatory genes within SPI-2 , was unable to survive within macrophages and unable to inhibit fusion between Salmonella-containing vacuoles ( SCV ) and lysosomal and endosomal compartments ( 48 ) . 
SpiC protein is translocated into the cytosol of infected macrophages by the type III secretion system in SPI-2 . 
Lee et al. ( 29 ) further reported that the SpiC protein interacts with a 
Macrophages are essential to defense mechanisms against many infections . 
A number of cytokines are known to affect the function of macrophages . 
Gamma interferon ( IFN - ) , produced by antigen-speciﬁc helper T cells , activates macrophages ( 33 , 34 ) , and this activation is critical for the host defense against intracellular pathogens that can survive within macro-phages ( 5 , 22 , 46 ) . 
Macrophage functions may , however , be blocked by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , IL-10 , and transforming growth factor beta ( 7 , 8 , 36 , 38 , 50 ) . 
In particular , IL-10 , which is a well-characterized anti-inﬂammatory cytokine ( 30 , 32 , 43 ) , can inhibit the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) and reactive nitrogen intermediates ( RNI ) in activated macrophages ( 7 , 21 ) , and macrophages are a major source of IL-10 production . 
Some intracellular pathogens , including several Salmonella spp. , Mycobacterium spp. , Legionella pneumo-phila , and Listeria monocytogenes , target macrophages as a site of infection . 
Some of these intracellular pathogens have been reported to use IL-10 to survive within macrophages or to inhibit the host defense by deactivating macrophages in murine models of infection ( 1 , 4 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 39 , 47 ) . 
Thus , IL-10 appears to play a role in creating a favorable environment for intracellular pathogens within macrophages .

host protein homologous to the family of NIPSNAP proteins , which may be involved in intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking . 
However , other researchers showed that SpiC is required for the translocation of SPI-2 effector proteins into target cells ( 15 , 51 ) . 
Thus , more research is needed to clarify the molecular function of SpiC . 
Recent studies ( 10 , 20 , 49 ) have shown that SPI-2 is required to inhibit fusion of SCV with vesicles of the endocytic pathway , such as inducible nitric oxide synthase-containing vesicles . 
SPI-2 is also involved in inhibiting recruitment of NADPH oxidase components to the phagosome . 
These observations indicate that a role of SPI-2 is to interfere with intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking to avoid exposure to toxic agents such as ROI and RNI in infected macrophages . 
In this study , we analyzed cytokine expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages to examine the mechanisms by which SPI-2 promotes intramacrophage survival and show the involvement of SPI-2 in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 in macrophages . 
Salmonellae cause an SPI-2-dependent increase in PKA activity that leads to cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) response element-binding protein ( CREB ) phosphorylation , resulting in up-regulation of IL-10 expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
In addition , we discuss the roles of endogenous IL-10 and the PKA signaling pathway in intramacrophage survival of salmonellae . 
This is the ﬁrst report that SPI-2 affects a signal transduction pathway that induces cyto-kine expression .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents . 
Reagents for cell culture were purchased from Sigma ( St. Louis , Mo. ) , and other reagents were purchased from the following sources : H-89 was from Seikagaku ( Tokyo , Japan ) ; PD98052 , SB203580 , and GF109203X were from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , Calif. ) ; SP600125 and dibutyryl cAMP ( dbcAMP ) were from Biomol ( Plymouth Meeting , Pa. ) ; and recombinant murine IFN - was from PharMingen ( San Diego , Calif. ) . 
H-89 , PD98052 , SB203580 , GF109203X , and dbcAMP were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . 
When these drugs were used , the ﬁnal concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was 0.1 % ; this concentration of solvent did not affect the cell responses . 
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
The strains used in this study were derived from wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028s . 
The spiC : : kan derivative EG10128 and purB : : Tn10 strain EG9652 were described by Uchiya et al. ( 48 ) . 
Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth ( LB ) . 
Kanamycin and tetracycline were used at 50 and 15 g/ml , respectively . 
Macrophage survival assay . 
The murine macrophage cell line Raw264 .7 was maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5 % CO2 in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( HyClone , Logan , Utah ) , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 100 g of streptomycin per ml . 
On the day before infection , the macrophages were plated at a density of 1.0 106/well in 6-well tissue culture plates ( Falcon ) or 0.4 106/well in 24-well plates in medium without antibiotics . 
The macrophage survival assay was conducted as described previously ( 48 ) . 
A multiplicity of infection of 25 bacteria per macro-phage was used . 
Semiquantitative reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR and Northern blot analysis . 
Total RNA was extracted from macrophages in six-well plates infected with bacteria ( 1:25 ) by using RNAzol B ( TEL-TEST , Friendswood , Tex. ) in accordance with the protocol recommended by the manufacturer and then digested with DNase I ( Stratagene ) . 
RNA ( 2 g ) was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies , Rockville , Md. ) by using an oligo ( dT ) primer . 
PCR was conducted in 20 - l reaction mixtures consisting of reaction buffer ( Perkin-Elmer , Forester City , Calif. ) , 0.5 M deoxynucleoside triphosphate , each primer at 1 M , 1 l of cDNA , and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer ) in cycles of 94 °C for 1 min , 55 °C for 1 min , and 72 °C for 1 min . 
Ampliﬁcation was carried out for 30 cycles for IL-1 , 35 cycles for IL-6 , 25 cycles for IL-10 , 30 cycles for IL-12 , 20 cycles for tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - ) , and 17 cycles for - actin , followed by a 7-min ﬁnal extension at 72 °C . 
In each case , the number of ampliﬁcation cycles achieved exponential ampliﬁcation , in which product formation was proportional to the starting cDNA 
( data not shown ) . 
The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . 
Visual analysis and image-analyzing software ( Gel-Doc 2000 System ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , Calif. ) were used for comparison of band intensities . 
The primer pairs were as follows : IL-1 , 5 - CTC TAG AGC ACC ATG CTA CAG-3 and 5 - TGG AAT CCA GGG GAA ACA CTG-3 ( 309-bp fragment ) ; IL-6 , 5 - TGG AGT CAC AGA AGG AGT GGC TAA-3 and 5 - TCT GAC CAC AGT GAG GAA TGT CCA-3 ( 155-bp fragment ) ; IL-10 , 5 - TAC CTG GTA GAA GTG ATG CCC-3 and 5 - CAT CAT GTA TGC TTC TAT GCA-3 ( 252-bp fragment ) ; IL-12 ( p40 ) , 5 - CGT GCT CAT GGC TGG TGC AAA-3 and 5 - CTT CAT CTG CAA GTT CTT GGG-3 ( 314-bp fragment ) ; TNF - , 5 - GGC AGG TCT ACT TTG GAG TCA-3 and 5 - ACA TTC GAG GCT CCA GTG AAT-3 ( 300-bp fragment ) ; - actin , 5 - TGG AAT CCT GTG GCA TCC ATG AAA-3 and 5 - TAA AAC GCA GCT CAG TAA CAG TCC-3 ( 350-bp fragment ) . 
For Northern blot analysis of IL-10 mRNA , 20 g of total RNA was electro-phoresed in a 1 % formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes ( Duralon-UV ; Stratagene ) in 10 SSC buffer ( 1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) . 
The 32P-labeled probes for IL-10 and glyceraldehyde 3-phos-phate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were incubated with the ﬁlters for 18 h at 42 °C , followed by two washes with 2 SSC containing 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) at 37 °C for 15 min . 
Final washes were carried out at 55 °C for 15 min with 0.2 SSC containing 0.1 % SDS . 
Bands were visualized by autoradiography and analyzed with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The probe for IL-10 corresponds to bases 1 to 636 of the murine IL-10-coding region . 
GAPDH was used as an internal standard for quantiﬁcation of total RNA in each lane of the gel . 
Quantiﬁcation of IL-10 . 
The amount of IL-10 present in culture supernatants was determined by a murine IL-10 capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with IL-10-speciﬁc MAb ( monoclonal antibody [ Ab ] ) JES3-9D7 as the capture Ab and biotinylated anti-IL-10 MAb JES-12G8 as the detection Ab ( PharMingen ) . 
The assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer 's recommendations and standardized with murine recombinant IL-10 ( Phar-Mingen ) . 
The sensitivity of the IL-10 ELISA was 10 pg/ml . 
Western blot analysis . 
Macrophages in six-well plates were changed to serumfree medium and then 5 h later were infected with bacteria ( 1:25 ) . 
At the indicated times postinfection , the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buff-ered saline and homogenized in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM NaF , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 20 M leupeptin , 20 M aprotinin ) , and protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad ) with bovine serum albumin as the standard . 
Total proteins ( 50 g ) were fractionated in SDS -- 10 % polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , Mass. ) . 
After blocking with Trisbuffered saline containing 3 % bovine serum albumin and 0.05 % Tween 20 , the membranes were incubated sequentially with primary Ab and horseradish per-oxidase-conjugated secondary Ab . 
Bands were detected by chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and analyzed with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer . 
Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and CREB was determined with the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK ( Tyr182 ) and PhosphoPlus CREB ( Ser132 ) kits from New England Biolabs ( Beverly , Mass. ) , respectively . 
PKA assay . 
Protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation was assayed as described by McKenzie and Pouyssegur ( 31 ) , with minor modiﬁcations . 
After infection with bacteria , the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in a buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 0.25 M sucrose , 5 mM EDTA , 10 mM EGTA , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 20 M leupeptin , 20 M aprotinin , 50 M - glycerophosphate , 200 M sodium orthovanadate , 50 mM NaF ) . 
The scraped cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C . 
After determination of protein concentrations , the supernatants were assayed for PKA activity with Kemptide ( Sigma ) as the substrate . 
Total PKA activity was measured in the presence of 10 M cAMP . 
PKA activity was calculated from the difference in ATP incorporation in the absence or presence of 1 M PKA inhibitor peptide ( Calbiochem ) and expressed as a percentage of the total PKA activity . 
Transfection with oligonucleotides ( ODNs ) . 
An antisense ODN ( AS-ODN ; nucleotide positions 637 to 654 ) directed against the sequence of murine IL-10 mRNA and a corresponding sense ODN ( S-ODN ) were synthesized , and transfections of macrophages with ODNs were conducted as described previously ( 2 ) . 
Statistical analysis . 
Each experiment was performed at least three times . 
The results are expressed as means standard deviations ( SD ) . 
Data on inhibitor effects on macrophage survival were analyzed with the unpaired two-tailed Student t test , and other data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Dunnett 's test . 
A P value of 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant 
RESULTS
The spiC and purB mutants are defective for intramacro-phage survival . 
We previously reported that a strain carrying a nonpolar mutation in the spiC gene is defective for intramac-rophage survival when assayed at 18 h postinfection ( 48 ) . 
In this study , we examined in detail the levels of intramacrophage survival of wild-type , spiC mutant , and purB mutant salmonellae at 2.5 , 5 , and 10 h after infection with the macrophage-like cell line Raw264 .7 . 
The purB mutant , which is deﬁcient in purine metabolism , is known to be defective for intramacro-phage survival ( 6 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , the level of intramacro-phage survival of both spiC and purB mutants was about 50 % of the wild-type level at 2.5 h postinfection . 
At 5 h postinfection , survival of the spiC mutant was unchanged , but that of the purB mutant was 30 % of the wild-type level . 
At 10 h postinfection , the levels of the spiC and purB mutants were about 40 and 5 % of the wild-type level , respectively . 
Because the spiC mutant is less defective in intramacrophage survival than is the purB mutant , the purB mutant can serve as a control to test whether spiC defects result simply from poor intramacrophage survival . 
Expression of cytokine mRNAs in macrophages infected with salmonellae . 
We next examined cytokine expression in macrophages infected with wild-type , spiC mutant , and purB mutant salmonellae . 
Expression was analyzed by RT-PCR of total RNA extracted from macrophages at 5 h postinfection . 
As shown in Fig. 2 , the level of IL-10 mRNA was lower in spiC mutant-infected macrophages than in wild-type-infected mac-rophages . 
The purB mutation did not affect IL-10 levels , indicating that the lower level of IL-10 expression induced by spiC mutant salmonellae is due to defective SpiC function and is not a result of reduced replication within macrophages . 
On the other hand , the levels of IL-12 ( p40 ) expression induced by the spiC and purB mutants were lower than that induced by wildtype salmonellae , indicating that IL-12 ( p40 ) expression is dependent on the level of intracellular proliferation of salmonellae . 
The expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1 , IL-6 , and TNF - showed no difference following infection with wildtype salmonellae and the spiC mutant , suggesting that the spiC gene could be speciﬁcally inﬂuencing the signal transduction pathway involved in IL-10 expression . 
Up-regulation of IL-10 expression is dependent on SPI-2 . 
To conﬁrm the RT-PCR analysis results , IL-10 mRNA in Sal-monella-infected macrophages was quantiﬁed by Northern blot analysis . 
The expression of IL-10 mRNA in wild-type Salmo-nella-infected macrophages at 2.5 h postinfection was increased 1.4-fold compared with that in spiC mutant-infected macrophages ( Fig. 3A ) . 
At 5 h postinfection , the difference in IL-10 mRNA expression was 2.5-fold . 
In accord with the RTPCR analysis results , the purB mutant induced the same levels of IL-10 expression as did the wild type . 
We next used an ELISA to examine the levels of IL-10 in culture supernatants of Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
As shown in Fig. 3B , IL-10 production increased during the course of infection . 
IL-10 levels were higher in macrophages infected with wild-type salmonellae or with the purB mutant than in those infected with the spiC mutant up to 10 h postinfection .

Salmonella growth levels within macrophages . 
Raw264 .7 macrophages in 24-well tissue culture plates were infected at a ratio of 10 bacteria per cell , centrifuged , and incubated for 20 min to permit phagocytosis . 
Macrophages were lysed at 0 , 2.5 , 5 , and 10 h and plated onto LB agar to determine the number of viable bacteria . 
For each mutant , the percent survival relative to that of the wild-type strain ( 100 % ) is presented .

The results of one of three experiments performed are presented . 
( B ) Time course studies of Salmonella-induced IL-10 production by macrophages .

The inset shows the result at 20 h postinfection . 
Data are the mean and SD of three independent experiments .

At 20 h postinfection , however , IL-10 production in wild-type Salmonella-infected macrophages was threefold higher than that in spiC or purB mutant-infected macrophages , presumably because the purB mutant had little or no capacity to survive within macrophages at 20 h postinfection . 
These results show that the spiC gene is involved in the up-regulation of IL-10 production in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
Raw264 .7 macrophages were used in this study because the levels of IL-10 expression in Raw264 .7 macrophages infected with salmonellae were higher than those in J774 macrophages or in peritoneal macrophages obtained from female BALB/c mice . 
Nevertheless , the three types of macrophages had the same pattern of IL-10 expression after infection with wild-type , spiC mutant , or purB mutant salmonellae ( data not shown ) . 
Involvement of PKA and p38 MAPK in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 . 
To understand the signal transduction pathways involved in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 , we tested the effects of several protein kinase inhibitors on IL-10 induction . 
As shown in Fig. 4A , IL-10 production in wild-type Salmonella-infected macrophages was dose dependently blocked by the PKA inhibitor H-89 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 . 
In contrast , addition of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2 ) inhibitor PD98052 , the PKC inhibitor GF109203X , or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not inhibit IL-10 production ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicate that both the PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways could participate in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 . 
To examine further the involvement of PKA in IL-10 production , we used an activator of PKA , dbcAMP . 
The level of IL-10 production was increased 16-fold whe 
Salmonella-infected macrophages were treated with 1.0 mM dbcAMP ( Fig. 4B ) , whereas treatment of uninfected macro-phages with dbcAMP had no effect on IL-10 production . 
These results show that up-regulation of IL-10 in Salmonella-infected macrophages may depend on the activation of PKA . 
Salmonellae induce SPI-2-dependent PKA activation , resulting in up-regulation of IL-10 expression . 
To examine the roles of p38 MAPK and PKA in Salmonella-mediated IL-10 induction , the levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and PKA activity were measured . 
p38 MAPK was assayed by Western blotting with phosphospeciﬁc antibodies . 
As shown in Fig. 5 , infection with wild-type salmonellae increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation . 
The increase was detectable 1 h postinfection , and by 5 h postinfection , phosphorylation levels were 1.9-fold higher than in uninfected cells . 
At 10 h postinfection , the levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in Salmonella-in-fected macrophages returned to the basal level ( data not shown ) . 
In contrast , the phosphorylation levels in spiC and purB mutant-infected macrophages were only slightly increased compared with those in uninfected macrophages , but there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two mutant strains during the course of infection . 
Together with results obtained with the p38 MAPK inhibitor , these results indicate that , although p38 MAPK is involved in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 , the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation is a result of the increased intracellular proliferation of wild-type salmonellae and may not depend on SpiC function . 
PKA activity in wild-type Salmonella-infected macrophages was higher than that in uninfected macrophages ( Table 1 ) . 
In contrast , the levels of PKA activity in spiC mutant-infected macrophages were the same as those in uninfected macro-phages . 
In addition , purB mutant-infected cells displayed wildtype levels of PKA activity up to 5 h postinfection , indicating that activation of PKA in wild-type Salmonella-infected mac-rophages depends on SpiC function . 
Since the spiC gene is involved in PKA activation , it was of interest to assay the phosphorylation of CREB . 
The catalytic subunit of activated PKA can phosphorylate CREB in the nucleus , which regulates the ability of CREB to activate transcription . 
Platzer et al. ( 40 ) reported that the IL-10 promoter contains a cAMP response element , where CREB binds , strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation of CREB is important for IL-10 expression . 
Thus , we measured the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 by Western blot analysis . 
As shown in Fig. 6 , increased levels of CREB phosphorylation in Salmonella-infected macrophages were ﬁrst observed at 2.5 h postinfection , and the elevation continued at 5 h . 
At 10 h postinfection , CREB phosphorylation returned to the basal level ( data not shown ) . 
The purB mutant showed the same effect on CREB phosphorylation as the wild type . 
The spiC mutant , however , induced approximately 1.4-fold lower CREB phosphorylation at 2.5 and 5 h postinfection . 
Taken together , these results demonstrate a role for the spiC gene in the activation of PKA , but not p38 MAPK , that leads to the phosphorylation of CREB , resulting in increased IL-10 production in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
The PKA signaling pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae . 
Having shown that salmonellae signiﬁcantly induce production of IL-10 from mac-rophages , we tested whether increased IL-10 production is important for intramacrophage survival of salmonellae . 
For this purpose , an AS-ODN complementary to IL-10 mRNA was used to inhibit IL-10 production ; a corresponding S-ODN served as a control . 
As shown in Fig. 7A , treatment with th

The graph shows percent IL-10 production by macrophages treated with dbcAMP compared to that by untreated macrophages .

AS-ODN ( 10 M ) decreased IL-10 production in wild-type Salmonella-infected macrophages to the level of IL-10 production in spiC mutant-infected macrophages . 
However , suppression of IL-10 production by the AS-ODN had little effect on the growth of wild-type salmonellae within macrophages ( Fig. 7B ) . 
In addition , treatment of macrophages with recombinant IL-10 at 1 to 10 ng/ml had no signiﬁcant effect on the intracellular growth of salmonellae ( data not shown ) , indicating that IL-10 may not be required to mediate the role of SPI-2 in intramacrophage survival . 
To examine further the effect of IL-10 on the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae , macro-phages activated by recombinant IFN - were used . 
Treatment with IFN - ( 10 to 1,000 U ) signiﬁcantly decreased the survival level of wild-type salmonellae in macrophages treated with the AS-ODN compared with that of macrophages treated with the a Macrophages were infected with wild-type , spiC mutant , or purB mutant salmonellae for 2.5 , 5 , and 10 h.

This result suggests that IL-10 could be inhibiting the cytotoxic mechanisms of macrophages activated by IFN - and shows the possibility that IL-10 plays an important role in the growth of salmonellae within activated macrophages in murine Salmonella infection . 
We next examined the inﬂuence of the PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways on the intramacrophage survival of salmo-nellae . 
As shown in Fig. 8 , treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had little inhibitory effect on the intracellular growth of salmonellae , whereas growth was strongly decreased by treatment with the PKA inhibitor H-89 in a dose-dependent manner . 
These results indicate that the PKA signaling pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in the intramacro-phage survival of salmonellae and suggest that the role of SPI-2 in the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae is at least partly mediated by the PKA signaling pathway . 
TABLE 1 . 
PKA activity in macrophages infected with salmonellaea 
DISCUSSION
Here we show the involvement of SPI-2 in the signal transduction pathway that induces IL-10 expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
Salmonellae cause activation of the PKA signaling pathway in a manner dependent on SPI-2 , resulting in up-regulation of IL-10 expression . 
In addition , we also found that the PKA signaling pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae . 
Previous work has shown roles for SPI-2 in inhibiting fusion of SCV with vesicles of the endocytic pathway , such as induc ible nitric oxide synthase-containing vesicles , and in inhibiting recruitment of NADPH oxidase components to the phagosome ( 10 , 20 , 48 , 49 ) . 
To examine the mechanisms by which SPI-2 promotes intramacrophage survival of salmonellae , we focused on the cytokines expressed in Salmonella-infected macrophages , since a number of cytokines have been reported to affect the function of macrophages . 
In particular , IL-10 is known as a macrophage-deactivating factor , as are transforming growth factor beta and IL-4 . 
Park et al. ( 39 ) reported that Legionella pneumophila , a facultative intracellular pathogen , stimulates production of IL-10 in human alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes , and IL-10 treatment enhances the growth of L. pneumophila in monocytes . 
Moreover , IL-10 may down-regulate the production of chemical mediators involved in inﬂammation , such as nitric oxide and ROI ( 7 , 21 ) . 
Certain viruses also can induce cellular IL-10 in macrophages ( 42 , 44 ) , whereas other viruses encode their own IL-10 homologs ( 28 ) . 
Thus , IL-10 appears to create a favorable environment for pathogen survival in macrophages . 
These observations prompted us to examine the role of IL-10 in the intramacro-phage survival of salmonellae . 
Unexpectedly , growth of salmo-nellae within macrophages was not affected either by antisense suppression of IL-10 production or by exogenously added IL-10 . 
However , in macrophages activated by recombinant IFN - , the AS-ODN did inhibit the intracellular growth of salmonellae . 
Taken together , these results indicate that IL-10 does not directly mediate the role of SPI-2 in promoting intramacro-phage survival of salmonellae . 
The results nevertheless raise the possibility that IL-10 plays an important role in the establishment of systemic infection by blocking the cytotoxic mechanisms of activated macrophages . 
Indeed , Arai et al. ( 1 ) showed that neutralization of endogenous IL-10 by anti-IL-10 MAb accelerates macrophage functions , enhancing the host defense against murine Salmonella infection . 
Our results showed that SPI-2 is involved in the up-regula-tion of IL-10 expression in Salmonella-infected macrophages , but it does not affect the expression of proinﬂammatory cyto-kine IL-1 , IL-6 , or TNF - , suggesting that SPI-2 could inﬂu-ence the signal transduction pathway involved in IL-10 expression in macrophages . 
Therefore , we examined which signal transduction pathways are involved in Salmonella-mediated IL-10 induction . 
We found that inhibition of p38 MAPK and PKA blocked this induction , supporting the involvement of both the p38 MAPK and PKA signaling pathways in this process . 
p38 MAPK is commonly activated by inﬂammatory cyto-kines and stress stimuli ( 37 ) . 
To examine further the role of p38 MAPK in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 , we measured the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK . 
Wild-type sal-monellae induced higher phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in macrophages than did spiC mutant salmonellae , but there was no signiﬁcant difference between spiC mutant and purB mutant salmonellae , which , like spiC salmonellae , are defective for intramacrophage survival . 
The purB mutant thus tests whether the results obtained are due to the levels of intracellular growth of salmonellae or directly related to SpiC function . 
Our results imply that although p38 MAPK is involved in Salmo-nella-induced expression of IL-10 , the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation is a result of the increased intracellular pro liferation of wild-type salmonellae and is not dependent on SpiC function . 
To conﬁrm the involvement of the PKA signaling pathway in Salmonella-induced expression of IL-10 , we measured PKA activity in infected macrophages . 
While wild-type salmonellae increased PKA activity in infected macrophages , the spiC mutant failed to induce any increase over the level in uninfected cells . 
Results obtained with the purB mutant control indicated that the increase in PKA activity depends on SpiC function and that the up-regulation of IL-10 production induced by wildtype salmonellae could occur through the activation of PKA . 
This conclusion is also supported by the fact that dbcAMP , which stimulates the PKA enzyme directly , enhanced IL-10 production in Salmonella-infected macrophages . 
Indeed , PKA activation leads to translocation of the catalytic subunit of PKA enzyme to the nucleus , where the phosphorylation of CREB takes place . 
A cAMP response element , where CREB binds , is present in the promoter region of the gene for IL-10 ( 40 ) . 
Eigler et al. ( 13 ) reported that the activation of PKA by cAMP enhances IL-10 production in peripheral blood monocytes . 
Thus , since phosphorylation of CREB via PKA activation is important for the up-regulation of IL-10 production , we measured the phosphorylation levels of CREB in Salmonella-in-fected macrophages and found that they correlated with the results of PKA activity . 
Given our ﬁnding that activation of PKA by salmonellae is dependent on SPI-2 , we examined the role of the PKA signaling pathway in the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae . 
The intracellular growth of wild-type salmonellae was dose dependently decreased by treatment with a PKA inhibitor , suggesting that PKA activation could be a critical mechanism that salmonellae exploit to survive within macrophages . 
This conclusion is also supported by the following observations . 
PKA down-regulates the activation of the NADPH oxidase component p47phox in stimulated neutrophils , and it directly phosphorylates Rap1A , a low-molecular-weight GTP-binding protein ( 3 , 17 , 41 ) . 
As phosphorylated Rap1A can not bind to the ﬂavocytochrome b558 component of the NADPH oxidase complex , no respiratory burst is elicited ( 9 ) . 
Thus , PKA affects components of the NADPH oxidase complex and reduces its ability to produce superoxide radicals , indicating that PKA plays a signiﬁcant role in superoxide-dependent mechanisms that kill ingested bacteria in phagocytes . 
Recent studies have shown that one of the mechanisms by which SPI-2 promotes the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae is interference with intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking so as to avoid exposure to toxic agents such as ROI or RNI . 
To our knowledge , there are no reports that describe the relationship between the PKA signaling pathway and intracellular trafﬁcking of vesicles . 
Taken together , these facts suggest that , in addition to inhib-iting intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking , SPI-2 also inhibits superoxide production by affecting components of the NADPH oxidase complex on the membrane of SCV through the activation of PKA . 
However , more research is needed to clarify the involvement of the PKA signaling pathway in the intram-acrophage survival of salmonellae . 
In conclusion , our study shows that Salmonella infection of macrophages causes activation of the PKA signaling pathway in a manner dependent on SPI-2 , which leads to CREB phosphorylation and results in up-regulation of IL-10 expression . 
Although the mechanism by which SPI-2 affects the PKA signaling pathway remains unknown , our results show that this pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in the intramacrophage survival of salmonellae .
