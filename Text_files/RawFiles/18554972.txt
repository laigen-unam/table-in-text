Abstract 
Catecholamines may stimulate enteric bacteria including the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) by two mechanisms in vivo : as a quorum sensing signal and a supplier of iron . 
To identify genes of Salmonella Typhimurium that respond to norepinephrine , transposon mutagenesis and DNA microarray analysis were performed . 
Insertional mutations in the following genes decreased norepinephrine-enhanced growth : degS , entE , entF , fes , gpmA , hfq , STM3846 . 
DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of several genes involved in iron acquisition and utilization during norepinephrine exposure , signifying the iron-limiting conditions of serum-SAPI minimal medium and the siderophore-like activity of norepinephrine . 
Unlike the wild-type parent strain , growth of neither a fepA iroN cirA mutant nor a fepC mutant , harboring deletional mutations in the outer and inner membrane transporters of enterochelin , respectively , was enhanced by norepinephrine . 
However , growth of the fepC and the fepA iroN cirA mutants could be rescued by an alternative siderophore , ferrioxamine E , further validating the role of norepinephrine in supplying the organism with iron via the catecholatespeciﬁc iron transport system . 
Contrary to previous reports using small animal models , the fepA iroN cirA mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium colonized the swine gastrointestinal tract , as did the fepC mutant .

1. Introduction
Bacteria possess the ability to sense , respond and adapt to environmental changes within and outside of the mammalian host . 
Adapting to these challenges is achieved via bacterial signaling mechanisms , such as two-component signal transduction systems , global transcriptional regulators and quorum sensing systems , which frequently results in changes in microbial gene expression . 
For example , an adaptation of quorum sensing bacteria to their in vivo environment is their ability of interspecies communication with the diverse , residen microbial community via the production of small hormonelike molecules called autoinducers ( AIs ) [ 1 ] . 
In addition , cellular communication may also occur between quorum sensing bacteria and their host . 
Sperandio and colleagues [ 2 ] have suggested that cross-talk between host hormones and the bacterial quorum sensing systems may occur . 
Thus , host hormones present in the gastrointestinal tract , such as norepinephrine , may notify enteric pathogens of their in vivo environment . 
In fact , in vitro investigations of the response of Salmonella and/or Escherichia coli to norepinephrine/epinephrine exposure revealed enhanced bacterial motility [ 2e4 ] , induced cellular adherence [ 5,6 ] , elevated virulence gene expression [ 7e9 ] , and enhanced bacterial growth due to increased iron availability to the bacterial cell [ 10,11 ] . 
The acquisition of iron within the host is essential for bacterial survival , cellular metabolism and pathogenesis . 
Consequently , bacteria employ siderophores , iron speciﬁc scavengers , to sequester and transfer iron into the bacterial cell via speciﬁc transport proteins [ 12 ] . 
However , the host has developed innate immune responses that impede the iron acquisition activity of bacterial siderophores , for example lip-ocalin 2 sequesters enterochelin [ 13 ] . 
As a countermeasure to host lipocalin 2 , products of the iroA gene cluster in Salmo-nella glucosylate enterobactin to produce salmochelin , thereby preventing lipocalin 2 binding and sequestration of enterobac-tin by the host [ 14e16 ] . 
Therefore , the competition for iron by both the host and the bacterial pathogen is notable since iron availability will in part determine the success of the pathogen within the host . 
Although Salmonella ( and other intracellular bacteria ) require iron for survival and growth , excessive intracellular iron is detrimental to the organism , requiring tight regulation of iron acquisition and uptake [ 17 ] . 
In the presence of high levels of iron , the Fur protein serves as a negative regulator of genes involved in iron utilization [ 18 ] . 
In this study , numerous Fur-regulated , iron response genes exhibited a decrease in expression levels when Salmonella Typhimurium was grown in the presence of norepinephrine . 
The goal of this study was to investigate the role of iron-regulated genes in norepinephrine-enhanced growth and swine gastrointestinal disease caused by Salmonella Typhimurium , especially the outer membrane catecholate receptors FepA , IroN and CirA as well as the inner membrane enterochelin transporter FepC .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strains and media
The Salmonella Typhimurium strains used in the study are presented in Table 1 and were grown in LuriaeBertani ( LB ) broth or serum-SAPI minimal medium containing 2.77 mM dextrose , 6.25 mM ammonium nitrate , 1.84 mM monobasic potassium phosphate , 3.35 mM potassium chloride , and 1.01 mM magnesium sulfate , 30 % porcine serum and 10 mM Hepes buffer [ 3 ] . 
Norepinephrine was used at concentrations of 50 mM and 2 mM . 
Norepinephrine is photosensitive , highly oxidized and has a short half-life ; therefore , two different concentrations were used in our studies for comparison to initial research in our laboratory and previously published data . 
Ferrioxamine E was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml . 
Antibiotics were used at the concentrations of 100 mg/ml for ampicillin , 30 mg/ml for nalidixic acid , 30 mg/ml for chloramphenicol and 50 mg/ml for kanamycin . 
Unless otherwise indicated , all chemicals were purchased from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) . 
Cultures were grown and assays performed at 37 C. Pre-conditioned serum-SAPI broth medium was prepared by diluting an overnight LB culture of BSX 8 20,000-fold in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ; Bi-oWhittaker 17-512F ) . 
The cells were further diluted 100-fold in serum-SAPI broth medium containing 50 mM norepineph-rine and incubated for 36e40 h at 37 C with shaking . 
The culture was centrifuged to pellet the cells , and the superna-tant was ﬁlter sterilized through a 0.2 mm ﬁlter and stored at 4 C. 
2.2. Transposon mutagenesis
Random transposon mutagenesis was performed in Salmo-nella Typhimurium UK1 by transforming the EZ-Tn5 < R6Kgori/KAN -2 > Tnp Transposome ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) into 50 C heat shocked ( 20 min ) , electrocompetent BSX 2 . 
Transformed cells were plated on LB kanamycin to select for transposon mutants , and a transposon mutant bank was stocked in 100 96-well microtiter dishes and frozen at 80 C. For screening of transposon mutants with decreased growth on serum-SAPI medium containing 50 mM norepinephrine , onehalf of a microtiter dish ( 48 wells ) was initially frogged to LB kanamycin and grown overnight . 
The LB kanamycin plate was then replicated to both serum-SAPI medium containing 50 mM norepinephrine and E glucose medium and incubated for 48 h at 37 C. Colonies with reduced growth ( based on a smaller colony size ) on serum-SAPI medium containing 50 mM norepinephrine compared to E glucose medium were selected for further analysis by transduction of the EZ-Tn5 transposon into BSX 8 ( c4232 ) using P22 . 
The resulting strains are shown in Table 1 . 
2.3. Construction of mutants by recombineering
Recombineering was performed as described previously [ 3 ] . 
Brieﬂy , PCR templates were used to produce linear knockout fragments using either oBBI 88/89 cat ( encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ) or oBBI 92/93 neo ( encoding the neomycin resistance gene ) that were initially PCR ampliﬁed from pACYC184 ( New England BioLabs , Beverly , MA ) and pCR2 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , respectively . 
Both oBBI 88/89 cat and oBBI 92/93 neo have stop codons in all three reading frames on both ends of the DNA fragment . 
Additionally , FRT sites are located at the 50 and 30 ends of the PCR fragment to facilitate FLP catalyzed recombination resulting in deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene [ 19 ] . 
Each pair of knockout primers for a particular gene contains a w45 nucleotide sequence on the 50 end that is homologous to the gen of interest ( bold ) and a universal sequence on the 30 end to bind to the oBBI 88/89 cat or oBBI 92/93 neo template for PCR ampliﬁcation ( Table 1 ) . 
Following PCR ampliﬁcation and gel puriﬁcation , the knockout fragment was transformed into arabinose-induced BSX 7 containing pKD46 [ 20 ] . 
Transformants were selected on LB containing the appropriate anti-biotic and a single colony isolated . 
Phage was grown on the knockout mutant using P22 and transduced into BSX 8 . 
The BSX 8 knockout mutant of each strain was transduced with P22 phage grown on BBS 120 containing pCP20 which encodes FLP recombinase [ 19 ] . 
Transductants were screened for loss of antibiotic resistance following induction of ﬂp at

2.5. Assessment of growth on serum-SAPI medium
Bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37 C with shaking in 3 ml of LB containing appropriate antibiotics . 
Five-hun-dred microliter aliquots of overnight cultures were washed once with 500 ml of PBS . 
The cells were resuspended in 500 ml of PBS and diluted 500-fold in PBS . 
Serum-SAPI minimal medium plates containing 1.5 % agar were spread with 100 ml of cells and allowed to dry for 30 min . 
A blank 6-mm paper disc ( BBL 231039 ) was placed onto the center of each plate and one of the following was added directly to the disc : 20 ml of 62.5 mM norepinephrine ( freshly prepared in serum-SAPI minimal medium ) , 20 ml of 6.25 mg/ml ferrioxamine E , or 25 ml of pre-conditioned serum-SAPI minimal medium . 
The diameters of growth zones around the discs were determined following incubation of the plates at 37 C for 20 h. All strains were evaluated in at least three independent assays . 
2.6. RNA isolation and puriﬁcation
An overnight culture of BSX 8 in serum-SAPI minimal me-dium was diluted 1:100 in serum-SAPI minimal medium with or without 50 mM or 2 mM norepinephrine , grown to mid-log phase ( OD600 1/4 0.4 ) , and processed in RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . 
Total RNA was isolated and puriﬁed using the RNeasy Midi kit and RNase-free DNase set ( Qiagen ) and Turbo DNase-free kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) . 
RNA integrity , quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 and RNA Nano 6000 Labchip kit ( Agilent technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) . 
2.7. DNA microarray analysis
RNA was labeled with aminoallyl dUTP via ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis followed by aminoallyl coupling to either Alexa 555 or 647 ﬂuorescent molecules ( Invitrogen ) according to Protocol M007 from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center at The Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR ; http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols.shtml ) . 
In dye swap hybridizations , labeled cDNA was hybridized to Salmonella typhimu-rium/typhi DNA microarrays ( version 2 ) developed and manufactured by TIGR ( http://pfgrc.tigr.org/desc.shtml ) using Protocol M008 . 
The ScanArray Express ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences , Boston , MA ) was used to scan the microarray slides and signal intensity measurements for each microarray spot were quantiﬁed using Scanarray Express 3.0 software . 
Back-ground-corrected data were normalized using the Lowess function , and poorly measured spots were removed by ﬁltering out those in which 50 % or more of the pixels from both samples were within two standard deviations of the background . 
The median intensity of the remaining spots was determined for each open reading frame , and ratios of the spot intensities for the experimental and control samples were calculated and log transformed for analysis on a minimum of three biological replicates . 
2.8. Real-time RT-PCR
Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit ( Qiagen ) and the Chromo4 RealTime PCR Detection System ( BioRad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . 
Primer sequences are provided in Table 1 . 
RT-PCR transcripts were ampliﬁed in duplicate from triplicate experiments with the following thermal cycling parameters : 50 C for 30 min , 95 C for 15 min , 35 cycles at 94 C for 15 s , 60 C for 60 s . 
At the 60 C step , ﬂuorescent data acquisition was performed . 
Following PCR cycling , disassociation curve analysis was performed from 55 C to 90 C with a plate reading at every 2 C and a hold for 5 s at each temperature increment . 
Relative quantiﬁcation of gene ampliﬁcation by real-time RT-PCR was evaluated using the comparative CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen [ 21 ] . 
The gyrase subunit B gene , gyrB , was used as the endogenous normalization control . 
The DCT values were calculated by determining the difference in threshold values for target and reference in each sample . 
Calculation of DDCT involved the subtraction of the no norepinephrine DCT value from the DCT value of the norepinephrine samples . 
Fold-differences in gene expression of the target gene are presented as 2 DDCT . 
Statistical analyses of the DCT values were analyzed by SAS Analyst ( Cary , NC ) using the two sample t-test for the means . 
Results were considered signiﬁcant when P < 0.05 . 
2.9. Swine study
Nine conventionally raised male and female piglets from Salmonella spp . 
fecal-negative sows were weaned at 12 days of age , shipped to the National Animal Disease Center , Ames , IA and raised in three groups of three in an isolation facility . 
Bacteriologic culture of rectal swabs was performed multiple times to conﬁrm that all pigs were negative for Salmonella spp . 
At 10 weeks of age ( day zero ) , all nine pigs received an intranasal inoculation of 1 ml of PBS containing 1.0 10 CFU of BSX 8 , BBS 108 ( DfepA DiroN 9 DcirA ) or BBS 110 ( DfepC ) . 
Pig fecal samples were obtained on days 1e7 post-inoculation ( p.i. ) for quantitative and qualitative Salmonella culture analysis as previously described [ 3 ] . 
At 7 days p.i. , the nine pigs were necropsied , and tissue samples of the gastrointestinal tract ( cecum , ileal Peyer 's Patch , ileocecal lymph nodes ) as well as spleen and liver were placed on ice for quantitative and qualitative Salmonella culture [ 3 ] . 
Statistical analysis of the number of Salmonella present in the indicated tissues and daily fecal samples ( cfu/g ) was analyzed by SAS Analyst using the two sample t-test for the means . 
Procedures involving animals were lawful and approved by the USDA , ARS , NADC Animal Care and Use Committee

3.1. Transposon mutagenesis identiﬁes iron response genes involved in norepinephrine-enhanced growth of Salmonella Typhimurium

In serum-SAPI minimal medium , the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium is dramatically enhanced in the presence of nor-epinephrine or pre-conditioned medium containing autoinducer [ 22 ] . 
Transposon mutagenesis was performed to identify Salmonella Typhimurium genes required for norepi-nephrine-enhanced growth on serum-SAPI minimal medium containing 50 mM norepinephrine . 
Transposon mutants that grew slowly were selected for further characterization based on their smaller colony size . 
DNA sequence analysis of the transposon junction region for the Salmonella Typhimurium mutants that exhibited decreased growth in the presence of norepinephrine identiﬁed the following genes : degS , entE , entF , fes , gpmA , hfq , and STM3846 . 
The zone diameters of growth for each of the mutants in the presence of norepineph-rine , pre-conditioned ( spent ) medium , or ferrioxamine E are presented in Table 2 . 
To determine if these genes are transcriptionally altered during norepinephrine exposure , real-time RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from the parent wild-type strain grown in serum-SAPI minimal medium with and without 50 mM norepinephrine ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Except for the degS gene , each of the genes assayed had signiﬁcantly lower levels of transcription in the presence of norepinephrine compared to its absence . 
The involvement of several Fur-regulated , iron response genes ( entE , entF , fes and gpmA ) in NE-enhanced growth and the altered expression of the hfq gene , encoding an RNA chaperone required for stability of several small antisense regulatory RNAs including RyhB [ 23 ] suggested that the ryhB gene may also be differentially expressed in the presence versus absence of norepinephrine : a 13-fold decrease in transcription was observed for the small regulatory RNA during norepinephrine exposure .

3.2. DNA microarray analysis conﬁrms the iron-limiting environment of serum-SAPI minimal medium and the siderophore-like activity of norepinephrine
Global investigation of the transcriptional proﬁle of Salmo-nella Typhimurium to norepinephrine exposure by DNA microarray analysis revealed 36 iron response genes with 1.5 fold decreased expression ( out of a total 88 genes ) in the presence of 2 mM norepinephrine compared to cultures grown without norepinephrine ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . 
Transcriptional analysis employing an additional DNA micro-array platform [ 24 ] also identiﬁed lower expression of iron response genes during norepinephrine exposure ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , elevated expression of the iron-regulated genes in serum-SAPI minimal medium indicates an iron limited environment that can be compensated with the addition of norepinephrine . 
From the DNA microarray results , several genes involved in iron acquisition and utilization were selected for real-time RT-PCR analysis . 
Fig. 1B illustrates the decreased transcriptional levels of cirA , fepA , iroN , fepC , iroC and sitB in the presence of 50 mM and/or 2 mM norepineph-rine . 
Since many of the genes are regulated by the global transcriptional iron regulator Fur , real-time RT-PCR was also performed for the fur gene ; a signiﬁcant , 2.5-fold reduction in gene expression was observed in the wild-type strain grown with 2 mM norepinephrine .

3.3. Enterochelin transport proteins required for norepinephrine-enhanced growth of Salmonella
Transcription of the genes encoding the catecholate side-rophore receptors , FepA , IroN , and CirA was decreased in the presence of norepinephrine . 
Single , double and triple mutants were constructed for the catecholate receptors as well as other enterochelin/salmochelin synthesis and transport genes . 
Unlike the parent strain , bacterial growth was not enhanced in the fepA iroN cirA mutant with the addition of norepinephrine ( Table 3 ) , phenotypically conﬁrming the involvement of the three outer membrane proteins in norepi-nephrine-facilitated iron uptake , as suggested by Williams et al. [ 25 ] . 
Furthermore , mutants of the fepDGC operon , encoding components of the ferric enterobactin transport system complex located at the inner membrane , also displayed a dramatic decrease in norepinephrine-enhanced growth . 
To further conﬁrm the role of norepinephrine in iron acquisition via the enterochelin transport system , growth on serum-SAPI minimal medium containing ferrioxamine E , a siderophore that utilizes a different outer membrane receptor ( FoxA ) and inner membrane transport system ( FhuBCD ) [ 26 ] was performed for several of the constructed mutants . 
As shown in Table 3 , providing the enterochelin transport deﬁcient fepA iroN cirA triple mutant or mutants of the fepDGC op-eron with an alternative siderophore resulted in bacterial growth , indicating that NE supplies Salmonella with iron in a siderophore-like manner and requires the catecholate transporters . 
3.4. Overlapping enzymes involved in enterochelin acquisition
Three enzymes hydrolyze enterochelin and/or salmochelin , Fes , IroD and IroE . 
Our results indicate that individual mutations in any of these genes have only minor decreases in growth on serum-SAPI minimal medium in the presence of norepinephrine . 
However , a fes iroD double mutant displayed a dramatic decrease in norepinephrine-enhanced growth ( Table 3 ) , suggesting redundancy in the enzymes that are required for norepinephrine-enhanced growth . 
3.5. Catecholate transport mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium are not attenuated for swine colonization
Rabsch et al. [ 27 ] and Williams et al. [ 25 ] report an attenuated phenotype for a fepA iroN cir mutant in the mouse model for systemic disease of Salmonella Typhimurium . 
To test the virulence of the triple mutant as well as a fepC mutant in a enterocolitis disease model of swine , BBS 108 ( fepA iroN cirA ) , BBS 110 ( fepC ) and BSX 8 ( wild-type parent strain ) were intranasally inoculated into 10-week-old pigs ( n 1/4 3 for each strain ) . 
No signiﬁcant difference in colonization of the three strains was observed in the Peyer 's Patch region of the ileum , ileocecal lymph nodes or cecum at 7 days p.i. ( Fig. 3 ) , nor was a difference observed in daily fecal shedding of Salmonella from the pigs during the 7-day experiment ( data not shown ) . 
As usually seen in our swine model of infection for Salmonella Typhimurium , Salmonella was not detected in the spleen or liver at 7 days p.i.

4. Discussion
Iron modulation in the host during microbial infection can inﬂuence the outcome of disease [ 28e30 ] . 
For example , individuals with iron-deﬁcient macrophages due to hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations appear to have elevated resistance to microorganisms that replicate in macrophages ( such as Salmonella , Legionella , Mycobacteria , Chlamydia , Yersinia ) [ 31 ] . 
Selection for this inherited mutation may have occurred during the European plagues due to the C282Y mutation conferring resistance to Yersinia infection [ 32 ] . 
Moreover , several pathogenic enteric bacteria , including Salmonella , convert enterochelin to salmochelin to circumvent sequestration of enterochelin by host lipocalin 2 [ 15 ] , emphasizing the importance of iron acquisition by microorganisms for their in vivo survival , proliferation and virulence . 
Investigations of enteric pathogens during exposure to the stress hormone norepinephrine revealed bacterial growth enhancement and motility induction via quorum sensing signaling [ 3,9,10,33 ] . 
Enhanced proliferation has been shown to involve the siderophore-like activity of norepinephrine supplying iron to the bacterial cell . 
Our transposon mutagenesis , DNA micro-array and real-time RT-PCR analyses provide a comprehensive examination of Salmonella Typhimurium genes involved in nor-epinephrine-enhanced growth , illustrating a higher expressio level for many iron-regulated genes during growth in ironlimiting , serum-SAPI minimal medium and a decrease in the expression of these genes in the presence of norepinephrine . 
It may seem counterintuitive that the expression of iron transport and utilization genes would be down-regulated when nor-epinephrine is present and providing Salmonella with iron . 
Keep in mind , excess iron can be toxic , requiring tight regulation of the iron response genes . 
When iron is available , Fur binds iron , and the iron-Fur complex binds to a DNA sequence referred to as the Fur box in the promoter region of iron regulated genes , thereby repressing transcription . 
Our transcriptional assays revealed lower expression levels of many Furregulated iron response genes , apparently due to norepinephrine furnishing iron to Salmonella . 
For instance , genes involved in enterochelin synthesis ( entE , entF ) , transport ( iroN , fepC , cirA , fepC , iroC ) and breakdown ( fes ) were identiﬁed in either the mutagenesis study ( to identify genes required for norepi-nephrine-enhanced growth ) or DNA microarray analysis ( to compare gene transcription in an iron-limiting medium with and without norepinephrine ) . 
Other investigators have described a requirement for the catecholate siderophore receptors FepA , IroN , and CirA in norepinephrine-facilitated iron uptake [ 25,27 ] . 
In our study , we demonstrate a requirement of the ferric enterobactin transport complex encoded by fepDGC for norepi-nephrine-enhanced growth of Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Therefore , norepinephrine-enhanced growth requires enterochelin synthesis ( entE , entF and entA ) , siderophore transport across the outer ( iroN , fepA , cirA ) and inner ( fepDGC ) membranes and siderophore hydrolysis in the cytoplasm ( fes , iroD ) . 
From our real-time RT-PCR data , a trend was detected for several iron-regulated genes ( iroN , iroC and sitB ) to have greater repression in the presence of an increased concentration of norepinephrine ( 2 mM vs. 50 mM , Fig. 1B ) . 
However , a surprising but repeatable result was observed with both cirA and fepA having greater repression in the presence of 50 mM norepinephrine compared to 2 mM norepinephrine . 
Although the authors are unclear of the signiﬁcance of these results , consider that these experiments are a snapshot in time and not a progression of gene expression changes over time . 
Moreover , differential control of the catecholate receptors may occur since the IroN receptor can transport salmochelin , enterochelin and breakdown products of both of these siderophores , whereas CirA only transports the siderophore breakdown products and FepA transports enterochelin and its breakdown products [ 16 ] . 
Greater transcriptional repression of the iroA locus ( including iroN ) is supported by our micro-array data . 
Another obvious group of genes that are down-regulated in Salmonella Typhimurium during norepinephrine exposure are genes that function in the Type III secretion system , especially those encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) . 
The role of SPI2 in Salmonella virulence has traditionally been associated with intracellular survival , systemic disease and persistent infection [ 34 ] , however recent investigations have revealed a need for SPI2 in intestinal pathogenesis [ 35 ] . 
Similar to the decrease in SPI2 transcription observed in the presence of norepinephrine in our study ( an iron-rich environment ) , Zaharik et al. [ 36 ] demonstrated that chelation of iron up-regulates the expression of Salmonella Typhimu-rium SPI2 virulence genes . 
Thus , an iron deplete environment ( as encountered during systemic infection ) triggers the expression of the SPI2 genes required for the establishment of systemic disease . 
As our attempts to mimic in vivo conditions with serumSAPI minimal medium identiﬁed many enterochelin synthesis and transport genes involved in norepinephrine-enhanced growth , mutations were constructed in the catecholate sidero-phore transporters for colonization studies in the swine enterocolitis model for Salmonella Typhimurium infection . 
Contrary to previous reports in the mouse model , the fepA iroN cirA mutant was not attenuated for colonization , and neither was the fepC mutant . 
Similar to most human infections , Salmonella Typhimurium in swine usually causes only enterocolitis . 
One could propose that localization of Salmonella Typhimurium to the porcine gastrointestinal tract may provide an environment for hijacking of siderophores produced by the swine ﬂora ; in so doing , the enterochelin transport mutants could survive and colonize the intestinal tract of the pig . 
An indication of the ability for Salmonella to prevail over the loss of the enterochelin transporters for iron acquisition was evident with the growth of the fepA iroN cirA and fepC mutants on medium containing a substitute siderophore , ferrioxamine E. On the other hand , systemic infections , as observed in the mouse model , may represent an iron-deplete environment without competing ﬂora serving as alternative siderophore providers . 
Thus , under systemic conditions , a fepA iroN cirA mutant may present a more dramatic decrease in colonization and disease , explaining the differences observed in the virulence status of the catecholate transport mutants in the different animal studies . 
This investigation raises a noteworthy issue : genes of Salmonella Typhimurium identiﬁed in the mouse model ( a systemic infection ) to be avirulent and a potential vaccine candidate may not be attenuated in larger mammals ( such as pigs and humans ) during gastrointestinal infections .
