ABSTRACT
ARTICLE HISTORY 
Chicken Toll-like receptor 15 ( ChTLR15 ) has been shown to participate in immune activation in response to various pathogens and in the innate defence against infection . 
Two genetically distinct Chinese breeds of chicken ( Qinyuan Partridge and Baier breeds ) were used to study the correlation between ChTLR15 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the natural infection status of salmonella in hens , and also to examine genetic and sex-speciﬁc effects on ChTLR15 mRNA expression in heterophils and spleen during acute infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) from 1 to 10 days after experimental infection . 
Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( G168A , C726T and A1166G ) in a single exon of ChTLR15 were identiﬁed in the two breeds , but only C726T showed a signiﬁcant association with salmonella infection . 
Compared with layer-type Baier chicks , meat-type Qingyuan chicks showed a higher tolerance for capture stress and ( SE ) infection , as measured , respectively , by the modiﬁed body weight of chicks in the control group and in the infection group . 
Meanwhile , ChTLR15 down-regulation in heterophils and up-regulation in spleen were involved in the response to pathogenic SE colonization during the acute infection period . 
These signiﬁcant genetic effects in females led to greater differences in both innate and adaptive immune responses than those exhibited in males . 
These results suggest that genetics , time and gender play important roles in the modulation of ChTLR15 mRNA level elicited by the SE-mediated immune response differentially in the two genetically distinct breeds , with a focus on sexual dimorphism .

Introduction
Poultry that are asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) can cause serious food safety and public health problems due to the risk of food poisoning following consumption of contaminated products ( Sadeyen et al. , 2004 ; Gantois et al. , 2009 ) . 
An effective innate immune response in the early stages of infection could reduce bacterial colonization and mortality in chicks , as well as persistence of infection in later stages ( Li et al. , 2013 ; Ramasamy , Verma , & Reddy , 2014 ) . 
Genetic variations among poultry have been shown to underlie differential responses to pathogenic SE colonization and to SE vaccination ( Zhou & Lamont , 2007 ; Redmond , Chuammi-tri , Andreasen , Palic , & Lamont , 2009 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are innate immune pattern recognition receptors ( Akira , 2004 ) that play a pivotal role in the early recognition of pathogens as well as in the initiation of a robust and speciﬁc adaptive immune response ( Ramasamy et al. , 2014 ) . 
There are numerous TLRs in both mammals and chickens that are capable of recognizing a wide array of bacterial and viral pathogens ( Akira , 2004 ; Takeda & Akira , 2005 ) . 
Numerous studies in chickens indicate a correlation between the function of TLRs and the susceptibility to infection with salmonella ( Nerren et al. , 2009 ) , but the chicken-speciﬁc TLR15 ( ChTLR15 ) has not been extensively studied . 
TLR15 , which was identiﬁed in the chicken genome through bioinformatics ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ) , is distinct from all other reported vertebrate TLRs and thus appears to be avian speciﬁc . 
There is a single exon in the gene of ChTLR15 ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ) , and its mRNA was detected in the spleen , bursa , leukocyte , testis , vagina , ovary , sperm and bone marrow of healthy chickens ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ; Nerren et al. , 2010 ; Anastasiadou et al. , 2011 ; Das et al. , 2011 ; Michailidis et al. , 2010 , 2011 ) , suggesting a role for this novel receptor in constitutive host defence ( MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Ciraci et al. , 2010 ; de Zoete et al. , 2011 ; Kogut et al. , 2012 ; Ramasamy et al. , 2012 , 2014 ; Oven et al. , 2013 ) . 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of immune-related genes are used in marker-assisted selection and may result in the enhancement of disease resistance ( Kramer et al. , 2003a ; Liu et al. ,

Four SNPs of ChTLR15 have been identiﬁed , but there is no information about the role of each SNP in response to pathogenic SE colonization in chicken resource populations ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ) . 
In vivo ( MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Gou et al. , 2012 ; Kogut et al. , 2012 ) and in vitro ( Okamura et al. , 2005 ; Redmond et al. , 2009 ; Kogut et al. , 2012 ; Pan et al. , 2012 ) studies have revealed that ChTLRs are closely linked to SE resist-ance . 
Current research suggests that ChTLR15 is involved in avian resistance to salmonella ( MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Ciraci et al. , 2010 ; Kogut et al. , 2012 , 2013 ; Ramasamy et al. , 2012 , 2014 ) . 
However , it has not been deﬁnitively established whether there is a change in the level of ChTLR15 expression in the immune systems of chickens during the acute period of SE infection . 
The relationship between gene polymorphism and expression level of ChTLR15 in immune organs and the ability of the bird to resist infection by pathogenic microorganisms have become the focus of our recent research . 
The objectives of this study were to determine : ( 1 ) whether there were genetic variations in the ChTLR15 gene associated with the innate immune response to salmonella infection in native Chinese chicken breeds ; ( 2 ) whether there were differences in non-stimulated and stimulated levels of weight gain and ChTLR15 mRNA expression in chick heterophils and spleen during acute SE infection ; and ( 3 ) whether the results obtained in ( 2 ) differed between breeds . 
Materials and methods
Animals and experimental design
The birds and experimental design of salmonella natural and artiﬁcial infection was reported in the previous study ( Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
Qingyuan Partridge breeds ( meat-type chickens ) and Baier breeds ( layer-type chickens ) were chosen for the detection of the natural Salmonella infection rates of two generations . 
Salmo-nella enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum ( SP ) and SE natural infection rates of cockerels ( n = 45 for each generation ) were similarly tested at the ages of 21 and 26 weeks in each generation . 
The infection rate was calculated by ( number of positive chickens ) / ( total number of chickens tested ) . 
The newly hatched chicks were collected from the two breeds of hens in the ﬁrst generation that were SP and SE negative , and fed under the same standard conditions from 1 to 12 days of age . 
At 2 days old , SE-nega-tive chickens of each breed were randomly divided into two groups : a control group ( the control group of Qin-gyuan Partridge chicks , abbreviated to Qingyuan Con group ; the control group of Baier chicks , abbreviated to Baier Con group ) and an infection group ( the infection group of Qingyuan Partridge chicks , abbreviated to Qingyuan SE group ; the infection group of Baier chicks infection group , abbreviated to Baier SE group ) . 
The infection group was inoculated with SE strain 50336 ( a gift from Dr. G.Q. Zhu in Yangzhou University ) at 106 colony-forming units ( cfu ) / 0.2 ml by subcutaneous injection in the neck , and the control group with 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline . 
Using this dose , all of the inoculated chicks showed signs of SE infection but did not die . 
After SE artiﬁcial infection by neck subcutaneous injection , the growth performance of the chicks was recorded at the ages of 3 days ( D3 ) , 5 days ( D5 ) , 8 days ( D8 ) and 12 days ( D12 ) , a period which is deﬁned as the acute infection period . 
At D3 , D5 and D12 , the blood and spleen samples ( n = 16 , 8 males and 8 females ) were collected and stored under aseptic conditions . 
The experiment was conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Academy of Chinese Agricultural Science . 
DNA extraction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) methodology
Blood samples were collected via wing vein in hens of the ﬁrst generation of each breed ( 93 Baier and 91 Qin-gyuan ) at the age of 21 weeks . 
DNA was isolated by phenol -- chloroform extraction . 
Ten primer pairs , shown in Table 1 , were designed according to the sequence of the ChTLR15 gene ( GenBank accession no . 
NM_001037835 ) . 
The primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. ( Shanghai , China ) . 
Polymerase chain reactions ( PCRs ) were carried out using commercial kits ( Sangon Biotech Co , Ltd. ) and performed using Mastercycle Gradient PCR machines ( Eppendorf , Westbury , NY , USA ) . 
The genotypes of individual birds were sequenced by Sangon Biotech Co , Ltd. . 
The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 12 % polyacrylamide gel . 
The silver staining method was used to display the bands . 
Individual PCR-SSCP banding patterns were determined under visible light . 
RNA extraction and ChTLR15 plasmid construction
Total RNA from chick heterophils and spleen was extracted using a TRIzol total RNA Kit ( DP421 , Tiangen Biotech Co. , Ltd , Beijing , China ) . 
Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed ( RT ) using a Quant-script RT Kit ( KR103-04 , Tiangen Biotech Co. , Ltd ) in a Bio-Rad DNA Engine Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC0200 ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 
The primers ( forward : 5 ′ - CGCTGGAAACTGATGGATTC-3 ′ and reverse : 5 ′ - TTCTTCGGGGCTCCACTTT-3 ′ ) were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. . 
The size of the ChTLR15 fragment generated via RT-PCR and real-time PCR is 295 bp , and its location in the ChTLR15 gene ( NM_001037835 ) is 2390 -- 2685 . 
After purifying the PC R products , ChTLR15 fragment was cloned into a pGEMT-Easy vector ( VT302 , Tiangen Biotech Co. , Ltd ) 
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was performed to quantitate ChTLR15 mRNA copy number using Super Real PreMix ( FP204-01 , Tiangen Biotech Co. , Ltd , Beijing , China ) with the Mx3000P system ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . 
The copy numbers of ChTLR15 in tested samples are presented as the standard curve relative to the ChTLR15 plasmid . 
Calculations
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.0 for Windows ( SAS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . 
Differences were tested using one-way ANOVA for independent samples . 
Differences ascribed to breed , sex , age , treatment , genotype and interaction were ﬁtted by univariate analysis of a general linear model . 
A P-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant . 
Differences in infection rate , gene frequency and genotype frequency were evaluated by a chi-squared test . 
Results
Natural infection rates of Salmonella
The natural infection rates of Qingyuan Partridge hens and Baier hens in response to pathogenic SP and SE colonization were presented in the previous study ( Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
In this paper , the values were evaluated by a chi-squared test , and the result presented that the SP infection rates of Qingyuan Partridge hens were signiﬁcantly lower than that of Baier hens ( in the ﬁrst generation , 0.01 < P < 0.05 ; in the second generation P < 0.01 ) . 
There was no difference in the SE natural infection rates of two breeds in two generations ( P > 0.05 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in SP and SE natural infection rate in these two varieties of birds in two generations ( P > 0.05 , data not shown ) . 
SSCP and DNA sequencing analysis
Three SNPs were detected in the single exon of the ChTLR15 gene ( shown in Figure 1 ( A -- C ) , respect-ively ) consisting of two synonymous changes at base positions 168 ( G to A ) and 726 ( C to T ) and a non-synonymous change at base position 1166 ( A to G ) . 
The non-synonymous change results in an amino acid substitution from lysine ( Lys ) to arginine ( Arg ) . 
Correlation between genotypes and S. Pullorum natural infection status
The genotype and allelic frequencies of G168A , C726T and A1166G in Qingyuan and Baier hens are shown in Table 2 . 
There was a signiﬁcant difference in the genotype frequencies of C726T ( P < 0.05 ) and A1166G ( P < 0.01 ) from the distribution expected under an assumption of Hardy -- Weinberg equilibrium ( Table 2 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the gene and genotype frequencies of G168A , C726T and A1166G between individual SP-negative and - positive hens in each breed ( Table 3 ) , with the exception of C726T in Baier hens ( P < 0.05 ) . 
However , as shown in Table 4 , a signiﬁcant difference in the genotype frequency of C726T has been presented between the two hen breeds marked as SP negative ( P < 0.01 ) , and a signiﬁcant difference in the genotype frequency of A1166G has been shown between the two hen breeds marked as SP negative ( P < 0.01 ) or positive ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Statistical analysis was applied to test the signiﬁcance of differences due to breed , sex and genotype among the gene loci G168A , C726T and A1166G , respectively . 
A signiﬁcant genotypic effect ( P = 0.043 ) existed for C726T in hens of both the Qingyuan ( P = 0.059 ) and Baier breeds ( P = 0.039 ) . 
In this study , a signiﬁcant interaction of C726T genotype and breed ( P = 0.006 ) correlated with natural salmonella infection status

As shown in Figure 2 ( A ) , chicks hatched from Qin-gyuan eggs exhibited signiﬁcantly lower neonatal weights than Baier chicks ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Compared with their respective neonatal weights , the body weights of chicks in the Baier Con , Baier SE and Qin-gyuan SE groups decreased signiﬁcantly at D3 , and only the weight of chicks in the Qingyuan Con group was unchanged . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in body weight between the Baier Con and SE groups at D3 , but the body weight of Qin-gyuan Con chicks was higher than that of chicks in the Qingyuan SE group ( P = 0.026 ) . 
From D5 to D12 , chicks of each group grew continuously , with the exception of chicks in the Baier SE group , which exhibited continued growth retardation . 
During convalescence , the weights of the control groups were consistently higher than the weights of the respective SE-treated groups at D5 , D8 and D12 ( P < 0.01 ) , and the weight of Qingyuan chicks was consistently higher than that of Baier chicks in both the control ( P < 0.05 ) and SE-treated groups ( P < 0.01 ) . 
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in body weight between males and females in either the Qingyuan or Baier chicken group , with the exception of Baier Con chicks at D5 ( males weighed more than females , P = 0.037 ) .

( B ) and ( C ) , the variation in body weight pattern after SE treatment between the sexes in each breed was in agreement with data shown in Figure 2 ( A ) , with the exception of the Baier male control group at D3 , which did not decrease signiﬁcantly from the hatch weight ( Figure 2 ( B ) ) . 
At D5 , the body weight of females in the Qingyuan Con and SE groups exceeded the females in the Baier Con group ( P < 0.01 ) , but this phenomenon did not appear in males until D8 . 
At D12 , the body weight of the females in the Qingyuan SE group reached that of the females in the Baier Con group ( P < 0.05 ) . 
There was a signiﬁcant interaction between breed , treatment and age in determining body weight in chicks during the acute period of SE infection ( P < 0.0005 ) , and the same proﬁle was shown in both sexes ( males , P < 0.0005 ; females , P < 0.0005 ) . 
ChTLR15 mRNA expression in heterophils
As shown in Figure 3 ( A ) , the base value ( BV ) of ChTLR15 mRNA expression differed signiﬁcantly between the two breeds at D3 , and the BV of the Qin-gyuan Con group was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the Baier Con group ( P < 0.0005 ) . 
At D3 , the ChTLR15 mRNA expression of the SE-infected groups ( the changed value , CV ) was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the Con groups ( Qingyuan P = 0.001 and Baier P = 0.005 ) , while the reduction of the CV compared to the BV in the Qingyuan chicks was approximately 2.0 times higher than in Baier chicks . 
At D5 , the BV and the CV showed no difference between the two breeds , and only the ChTLR15 mRNA expression of chicks in the Baier SE group was lower than that of the Baier Con group ( P = 0.023 ) . 
During convalescence ( at D12 ) , there was no signiﬁcant difference in the expression level of ChTLR15 between the Con and SE groups of each breed , and but the BV and the CV differed signiﬁcantly between the two breeds ( P < 0.0005 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the expression level of ChTLR15 mRNA between males and females in the Qingyuan and Baier chicken groups , except for the BV of Baier Con at D12 ( P = 0.022 ) . 
As shown in Figure 3 ( B ) and ( C ) , the difference in pattern of ChTLR15 mRNA expression after SE treatment between sexes of each breed was coincident with that shown in Figure 3 ( A ) , except that the value of the Baier Con males at D5 did not differ from that of the Baier SE group . 
At D3 , the decrease in the ratio of CV to BV in the Qingyuan females was approximately 4.0 times higher than in the Baier females , which was noticeably more than the approximately 1.6-fold difference observed between males of the two breeds . 
At 5 days of age , there was a signiﬁcant difference in ChTLR15 expression level alone between the Con and SE groups of Baier female chicks ( P = 0.019 ) . 
During convalescence ( at D12 ) , there was a signiﬁcant difference in the BV and the CV of the males or the females between the two breeds ( P < 0.05 ) . 
There was a signiﬁcant interaction of breed and age on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA in male and female chicks together ( P = 0.003 ) as well as in female chicks alone ( P = 0.018 ) . 
There was a signiﬁcant interaction of breed , treatment and age on ChTLR15 mRNA copy number in chicks regardless of sex ( P < 0.0005 ) as well as in the different sexes ( males , P = 0.023 ; females , P < 0.0005 ) during the period of acute SE infection . 
In Baier chicks , there was a signiﬁcant effect of gender on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA ( P = 0.005 ) , and there was a signiﬁcant effect of age on that ( P = 0.050 ) only in female chicks . 
In Qingyuan chicks , there was a signiﬁcant effect of age on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA ( P = 0.005 ) as well as in female chicks alone ( P = 0.001 ) . 
There was a signiﬁcant interaction of treatment and age on ChTLR15 mRNA copy number in chicks regardless of sex in Baier chicks ( P = 0.016 ) and Qingyuan chicks ( P < 0.0005 ) as well as in th different sexes of Qingyuan chicks alone ( males , P = 0.055 ; females , P < 0.0005 ) during the period of acute SE infection . 
Only in Baier female chicks , the correlation between the body weight and the CV of ChTLR15 mRNA was signiﬁcantly positive and linear ( r = 0.480 , P = 0.038 ) .

ChTLR15 mRNA expression in the spleen
As shown in Figure 4 ( A ) , neither the BV nor the CV of ChTLR15 mRNA expression differed between the two breeds at the detected stages , other than the BV at D3 in the Qingyuan Con group , which was higher than that of the Baier Con group ( P = 0.003 ) . 
After SE infection , the expression level of ChTLR15 mRNA in chicks of each breed increased signiﬁcantly at each stage assayed . 
Between D3 and D12 , the BV of the Baier Con group increased continuously , but the BV of the Qingyuan Con group was maintained at the same level from D5 onwards . 
From D5 , the CV of chicks after SE infection did not differ between the two breeds . 
However , the increased product of the CV compared to the BV in Baier chicks was approximately 5.5 times higher at D3 and 2.0 times higher at D5 than in the Qingyuan chicks 
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in ChTLR15 expression level between males and females of the Qingyuan and Baier groups , with the exception of the BV of the Baier Con group at D5 ( P = 0.016 ) . 
As shown in Figure 4 ( B ) and ( C ) , the pattern of ChTLR15 mRNA expression after SE treatment in different sexes of each breed was coincident with that shown in Figure 4 ( A ) , except in Baier males at D12 , which did not show any difference between the Con and SE groups . 
The increased products of the CV compared with the BV in Baier female chicks were approximately 4.5 times higher at D3 and 3.8 times higher at D5 than in Qingyuan females , while the increased product in Baier male chicks was 6.0 times higher than in Qingyuan males only at D3 . 
There were signiﬁcant age and sex effects ( P < 0.0005 and P = 0.038 , respectively ) on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA in chicks , while a signiﬁcant interaction of age and breed was detected in females ( P = 0.030 ) . 
There were signiﬁcant treatment and age effects ( P < 0.0005 and P < 0.0005 , respectively ) on the pattern of ChTLR15 mRNA expression in chicks during the acute period of SE infection and between sexes ( males , P < 0.0005 , P = 0.005 ; females , P < 0.0005 , P < 0.0005 , respectively ) . 
Moreover , a signiﬁcant interaction between age , breed and treatment on the pattern of ChTLR15 mRNA was detected only in female chicks ( P = 0.045 ) . 
In Baier chicks , there was a signiﬁcant effect of age on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA regardless of sex ( P < 0.0005 ) as well as in the different sexes ( males , P = 0.044 ; females , P = 0.001 ) . 
In Qingyuan chicks , there was a signiﬁcant effect of age and gender on the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA ( P < 0.0005 , P = 0.005 , respect-ively ) as well as a signiﬁcant effect of age on that in the different sexes ( males , P = 0.005 ; females , P = 0.005 ) . 
There was a signiﬁcant effect of treatment on ChTLR15 mRNA copy number in chicks regardless of sex in Baier chicks ( P < 0.0005 ) and Qingyuan chicks ( P < 0.0005 ) as well as in the different sexes of the two breeds ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) during the period of acute SE infection . 
Only in Baier female chicks , the correlation between the body weight and the BV of ChTLR15 mRNA was signiﬁcantly positive and linear ( r = 0.867 , P = 0.002 ) . 
Discussion
Genetic variation has been linked to variation in the response to different salmonella strains in mammals and poultry ( Kramer et al. , 2003b ) . 
The effect of genetic variables on SE resistance has typically been measured by the presence of both innate ( phagocytic activity ) and adaptive immune responses , which are important for combating natural and experimental infection ( Kramer et al. , 2003b ; Malek et al. , 2004 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
The natural infection rate and the bacterial load in organs are the main indexes used to quantify resistance ( Gantois et al. , 2009 ; Gou et al. , 2012 ) . 
In a previous study , immunocompetence traits related to natural resistance to SE were measured in two genetic groups of different Chinese chickens ( Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
Broiler-type Qin-gyuan Partridge hens presented with a lower SP infection rate and were not as susceptible to salmonella infection as layer-type Baier hens , as shown in previous reports ( Abasht et al. , 2009 ; Zhou & Lamont , 2007 ) , but no difference in the SP and SE natural infection rate was presented between the two breeds of cockerel . 
The difference in the SP and SE natural infection rate between the two hen breeds in each generation was approximately 10 % and 4 % , respectively . 
It was suggested that the natural infection rates of SP and SE in hens two gaps in the two breeds were relatively stable under current environmental conditions , and SP was the predominant serovars of salmonella isolated from chickens in China ( Gong et al. , 2014 ) . 
Prior to the 1960s , SE was rare among poultry ; however , with the reduction and elimination of S. enterica serovar Gallinarum and SP , the prevalence of SE in chickens increased ( Foley et al. , 2008 ) . 
It appears likely that the compatible colonization site exists among SE , S. Gallinarum and SP in poultry ( Rabsch et al. , 2000 ; Velge et al. , 2005 ; Foley et al. , 2008 ) . 
A change of body weight in chicks after experimental SE infection is not frequently used to estimate the resistance in different breeds . 
In this study , the growth of chicks was recorded after experimental SE infection . 
In this study , the initial weight before challenge with SE at the age of 2 days of the Baier chicks was higher than that of the Qingyuan chicks , and there was no difference between the males and the females in the same breed . 
Comparing the change of body weight in the control group between the two varieties after challenge with SE at D2 , it indicated that the Baier males and the Qingyuan females have higher tolerance to capture stress than the Baier females . 
Compared with susceptible varieties after challenge with SE at D2 , the body weight of resistant chicks of the Qingyuan Partridge breed presented a continuous growth increase during the acute infection period , which indicated a higher tolerance to SE infection , especially in its females . 
It also suggested that the meat-type Qingyuan Partridge chicken is less susceptible to SE than the layer-type Baier chicken , which is consistent with previous studies ( Zhou & Lamont , 2007 ; Abasht et al. , 2009 ) . 
TLRs recognize evolutionarily conserved molecular motifs on pathogens and the associated molecular patterns of infectious microbes to initiate an innate immune response upon activation by relevant patho-gens . 
Previous studies have conﬁrmed that genetic variations in TLRs among distinct breeds of Chinese chicken could contribute to different responses to pathogenic SE colonization ( Malek et al. , 2004 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
In addition , the involvement of th avian-speciﬁc TLR15 gene has been hypothesized due to a signiﬁcant association between SNPs within the gene and susceptibility to natural salmonella infection . 
Two synonymous changes at base positions 168 ( A to G ) and 450 ( C to T ) and two non-synonymous changes at base positions 926 ( A to C ) and 1363 ( T to G ) were shown in the ﬁrst report describing ChTLR15 ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , the association between SNPs of ChTLR15 and natural salmonella infection has not been reported . 
Our results support the notion that three SNPs ( G168A , C726T and A1166G ) in the single exon of the ChTLR15 gene are associated with infection ; SNPs were scanned in the two different breeds , and only C726T showed a signiﬁcant association with salmonella natural infection status . 
This suggested that the T allele in C726T might be a locus linked to resistance of salmonella infection . 
TLR signalling pathways are the ﬁrst line of defence against SE infection , and changes in host gene expression accompanying bacterial infection would help to elucidate the basis of the molecular genetic control of disease resistance ( Takeda & Akira , 2005 ; MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Gou et al. , 2012 ) . 
Avian-speciﬁc TLR15 might recognize a broad-spectrum of microbe-associated molecular patterns , including bacterial lipoproteins ( Oven et al. , 2013 ) . 
The role played by avian-speciﬁc TLR15 in host response may constitute a mechanism for stimulating the innate immune response against bacterial infection in in vitro ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ; Ciraci et al. , 2010 ; Das et al. , 2011 ; de Zoete et al. , 2011 ; Kogut et al. , 2012 ) and in vivo ( Higgs et al. , 2006 ; Lu et al. , 2009 ; MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Nerren et al. , 2009 ; Kumar et al. , 2011 ; Kogut , Genovese , He , Swaggerty , & Jiang , 2013 ; Ramasamy et al. , 2014 ) studies . 
Reports describing ChTLR15 expression level in chickens infected with SE exist only for the intestinal tract ( MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Nerren et al. , 2009 ; Kogut et al. , 2013 ) and gonad ( Ana-stasiadou et al. , 2011 ; Michailidis et al. , 2010 , 2011 ) in vivo and chicken mononuclear cells ( Pan et al. , 2012 ) and heterophils ( Kogut et al. , 2012 ; Nerren et al. , 2009 , 2010 ) in vitro . 
The current study was designed to create an experimental model to study the effect of infecting chicks with SE on the expression level of ChTLR15 mRNA in the blood heterophilic granulocytes and spleen of young birds during the acute infection period following a typical ﬁeld challenge with SE . 
Heterophils in chickens are the ﬁrst responders to bacterial infections and are therefore responsible for initiating the immune response against SE challenge ( Ramasamy et al. , 2014 ) . 
Up-regulation of ChTLR15 expression in heterophils likely accounts for some of the differences in susceptibility to in vitro salmonella infection observed between breeds ( Nerren et al. , 2009 ) . 
In this study , the level of ChTLR15 mRNA expression in heterophils decreased following inoculation with SE 50336 in vivo . 
In comparison with susceptible birds , the blood heterophils of resistant birds exhibited reduced or suppressed early heterophil responses to SE ( Redmond et al. , 2009 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
It was suggested that the heterophil responses to SE in vivo and in vitro were not the same . 
Based on the growth performance of chicks , the Qingyuan SE group caught up to normal growth at 5 days of age , whereas the body weight of chicks in the Baier Control group showed the same developmental pattern at D5 as Baier SE chicks at D8 . 
It has been suggested that the unique response of Qingyuan chickens in comparison with Baier breed chickens was the result of genetic selection to increase growth , which may have its basis in reduced or suppressed antigen presentation . 
In this study , although the expression of ChTLR15 mRNA in heterophils from both breeds decreased signiﬁcantly in response to SE challenge , the reduction of ChTLR15 mRNA in heterophils from Qingyuan chicks resistant to infection with SE was signiﬁcantly greater than that observed in Baier chickens susceptible to infection with SE . 
The process of genetic selection to increase growth may be described as , or derived , from genetic difference of higher ChTLR15 mRNA BV and higher CV/BV down-modulation in heterophil granulocytes , which could lead to suppressed intracellular bacterial growth , especially in its females . 
Interestingly , the ChTLR15 gene presented asynchronous expression both in heterophils and in the spleen , which might be related to the function of other genes and immune organs , such as chTLR4 ( Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
In this study , ChTLR15 mRNA expression in the spleen increased following inoculation with SE strain 50336 . 
Avian-speciﬁc TLR15 was deemed to be functionally equivalent to a group of TLR2 family proteins that the mammalian innate immune system utilizes to recognize a broad spectrum of microbeassociated molecules , including bacterial lipoproteins ( Oven et al. , 2013 ) . 
It has been reported that infected chicks exhibit signiﬁcant up-regulation in the levels of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in spleen ( Abasht , Kaiser , & Lamont , 2008 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
In chickens , the spleen acts as the recruitment site of SE for mounting an immune response against SE challenge ( Kramer et al. , 2003a ; Chappell et al. , 2009 ) , which matched the detected bacterial load in this study . 
In this study , SE loaded in the spleen at 5 days of age reached a higher amount than in the other organs and at other examined stages ( data not shown ) . 
Decreased expression of ChTLR15 mRNA in heterophils might reduce the efﬁciency of antigen presentation , thereby suppressing early heterophil response to SE and reducing injury . 
Increased expression of ChTLR15 mRNA in the spleen may improve the efﬁciency of antigen presentation to excite the immune response against SE challenge and to promote recovery ( Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
In this study , although the expression of ChTLR15 mRNA in the spleens of both breeds increase signiﬁcantly in response to SE challenge , the increased product of the CV compared to BV in Baier chicks susceptible to SE infection was higher at D3 and D5 than in the Qingyuan chicks resistant to SE infection , especially in females . 
ChTLR15 recognizes a unique , non-secreted , heat-stabile component of both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria that is capable of causing disease in chickens but does not recognize numerous bacterial-derived TLR agonists ( Nerren et al. , 2010 ) . 
Therefore , it has been suggested that the bacterial load of the spleen in Baier chicks may be greater than that in Qingyuan chicks after artiﬁcial infection with SE , triggering a much stronger immune response against SE challenge in Baier chicks than in Qingyuan chicks . 
Meanwhile , the response of Qin-gyuan chicks , in contrast with Baier chicks , may be the consequence of genetic selection to increase growth , which might favour reduced or suppressed inﬂammatory responses , especially in females . 
In this study , genetic variation in response to patho-genic SE colonization has been proven to exist in distinct Chinese genetic breeds ( Zhou & Lamont , 2007 ; Redmond et al. , 2009 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) , some of which exhibited sexual dimorphism . 
The signiﬁcant genetic effects observed in females led to a greater difference in both innate and adaptive immune responses than those exhibited in males . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the SP natural infection rate in males of the two varieties , but a signiﬁcant difference existed in females . 
The signiﬁcant sex difference affected growth performance after capture stress and SE infection . 
The sexual dimorphism in response to SE infection is suggested to have its basis in the sex-based modulation in TLR immune response to pathogens ( Abasht et al. , 2008 ; Li et al. , 2013 ) . 
Between the two examined breeds , the greater differences in ChTLR15 mRNA expression in immune organs presented by female birds may match body weight parameters , in the Qingyuan breed which recovered earlier than the Baier breed . 
Furthermore , no signiﬁcant difference in ChTLR15 mRNA expression existed between males and females of the same breed , and no differences in ChTLR15 mRNA expression in immune organs presented by male birds between the two different breeds presented nearly the same body weight parameters . 
No explanation is available , at the moment , for the sex-speciﬁc effect of SE exposure observed in the pre-sent study . 
The differences in immune response among females are more pronounced . 
It is presumed that genetic and sex-speciﬁc variation exists in response to SE not only in poultry but also in mammals as a result of natural selection . 
Compared with layertype Baier chicks , meat-type Qingyuan chicks showed a higher tolerance for salmonella arti cial infection in ﬁ this study , it could partly explain that Qingyuan Partridge hens presented with a lower salmonella natural infection rate . 
In summary , we have shown two contrasting phenotypes in genetically distinct Chinese chicken breeds based on the evaluation of resistance to salmonella by agglutination test in hens and SE artiﬁcial infection in chicks . 
Genetic variation in response to pathogenic SE colonization also existed in these distinct Chinese chicken resource populations . 
For the ﬁrst time , a correlation between the SNPs of the ChTLR15 gene and natural salmonella infection rates in hens as well as the effects of genetic factors and gender on SE infection and the level of ChTLR15 mRNA expression in hetero-phils and spleen were studied in two genetically distinct Chinese chicken breeds . 
Three SNPs ( G168A , C726T and A1166G ) in the single exon of ChTLR15 were examined in the two breeds , and only C726T showed signiﬁcant association with salmonella natural infection status . 
The down-regulation of ChTLR15 expression in heterophils and the up-regulation in spleen was involved in artiﬁcial SE-mediated immune response during the acute infection period in a sexually dimorphic fashion . 
The signiﬁcant genetic effects in females led to greater differences in both the innate and adaptive immune responses than were observed in males . 
These results presented that genetics , age and gender play important roles in ChTLR15 mRNA expression level and modulation in heterophil granulocytes and spleen during SE-mediated immune response between two genetically distinct Chinese chicken breeds . 
It was suggested that an effective innate immune response of the meat-type Qingyuan Partridge chicken in the early stages of infection could reduce bacterial colonization and mortality more than it does in the layer-type Baier chicken , as well as reducing persistency of infection in later adult stages .
