Introduction
Abstract
Fresh-cut produce is an estimated multi-billion dollar market and sales are increasing each year ( Cook 2014 ; Baselice et al. 2017 ) . 
In China , the consumption of freshcut vegetables is growing rapidly in recent years . 
Fresh-cut vegetables serve not only as ready to eat dishes such as salad , but also as materials of stir fry cooking and Chinese hot pot . 
They are at greater risk of bacterial contamination than thermally processed foods ( Callejon et al. 2015 ) , as there are not widely accepted reliable methods for inactivating all bacteria and controlling all the parameters necessary for produce with an extended shelf-life and without compromising its quality ( Ramos et al. 2013 ) . 
Thus , expeditious detection and early warning systems play an important role in reducing the dissemination of contaminated products . 
It is therefore imperative to ﬁnd rapid and more sensitive methods to detect patho-gens in fresh-cut produce to ensure food safety . 
Salmonella enterica , a common foodborne pathogen , causes gastroenteritis , septicaemia and even death in human ( Crump et al. 2015 ) . 
In China , approximately 70 -- 80 % of foodborne bacterial outbreaks are caused by 
Salmonella ( Yang et al. 2010 ) . 
Conventional methods for the detection of Salmonella in food involve selective culture enrichment with subsequent culturing on selective media , followed by serological and/or biochemical tests for species identiﬁcation , and it usually takes several days to conﬁrm a positive or negative result ( Andrews et al. 2016 ) . 
These procedures are obviously unable to meet the requirements of Salmonella detection of fresh-cut produces . 
An alternative method for detection and identiﬁcation of Salmonella with better performance , which reduces cost and turnaround time to results , would be of great value to the fresh-cut food industry . 
Real-time PCR ( qPCR ) has the ability to enable the rapid and speciﬁc identiﬁcation of foodborne pathogens ( Huang et al. 2007 ; Yeni et al. 2014 ) , and offer several advantages over the conventional microbiological methods . 
Real-time PCR targeting speciﬁc genes in genomic DNA has been used for the detection of Salmonella spp . 
in foods ( Hoorfar et al. 2000 ; Krascsenicsova et al. 2008 ; Chen et al. 2010 ) , but it is unable to distinguish DNA of viable cells from that of dead cells , which might cause false-positive results . 
Treatments with propidium monoa-zide ( PMA ) were employed as a strategy to eliminate the interference from dead cell DNA ( Liang et al. 2011 ; Li and Chen 2013 ) . 
However , the inhibition of ampliﬁcation of DNA of dead cells may be incomplete according to PMA concentration applied , and PMA concentration and treatment procedure altered the inhibitory efﬁciency of the remaining qPCR signal originated from dead cells ( Xiao et al. 2015 ) . 
Using RNA as detection material has the advantage of higher sensitivity as there are even hundreds of copies of RNA that correspond to a single gene . 
If the copy number was high enough , rapid detection of Salmonella can be achieved , an enrichment may be not necessary . 
Since RNA from dead cells is not stable in vitro and very susceptible to the ubiquitous RNase in the environment , the detection targeting RNA would not be interfered with dead cells . 
In other word , detection of RNA could speciﬁcally detect only viable cells ( Gonzalez-Escalona et al. 2009 ; Miller et al. 2009 ) . 
Moreover , many of previous works applied no time or a short time after the inoculation of vegetables , immediately followed by the recovery or enrichment process . 
Taking into account the complex interaction between Salmonella and fresh-cut vegetables during storage , a 6-h processing and storage time before detection were included in this study , since pathogen usually contaminate food during processing and survive during storage and exhibition . 
The objective of this research was to evaluate the capability of RT-qPCR targeting Salmonella tmRNA , which is a high copy numbered target , for the detection of Sal-monella in fresh-cut vegetables after 6-h storage and whether the method could detect the pathogen with a short enrichment . 
Results and discussion
Limit of detection
Three S. enterica strains were individually grown until the exponential phase . 
Bacterial cells were collected and mixed equally to form a Salmonella cocktail . 
Total RNA ( 0 6 lg ll 1 ) extracted from 1 ml of 10 CFU per ml Salmonella cocktail was 10-fold 6 serially diluted to generate a standard curve and assess the limit of detection ( LOD ) of one-step RT-qPCR . 
The standard curve plotting Ct values against the RNA quantities equivalent to CFU concentrations ( CFU per ml ) was generated and shown in Fig . 
S2 . 
The standard curve covers the CFU concentration range of 10 to 10 CFU per ml and the equation was also shown in 0 6 
Fig . 
S2 . 
Reaction efﬁciency of RT-qPCR was 99 267 % calculated using the slope of the standard curve by QuantStudioTM 7 FLEX REAL-TIME PCR software v1 .2 . 
The results also showed that up to 10 - fold diluted RNA samples were detected by one-step RT-6 qPCR with a Ct value < 37 , suggesting that the LOD could be as low as about 1 0 CFU per ml . 
Detection of Salmonella tmRNA at different growth phases and different pH
Total RNA from all samples at different growth phases and different pH was quantiﬁed using a UV-Visible spectrometer and diluted to the same concentration . 
Then equal amount ( 100 ng for each PCR reaction ) total RNA was used for one-step RT-PCR to investigate the effect of growth phase and environmental pH on expression of the ssrA gene . 
Ct values of RT-qPCR targeting Salmonella tmRNA were shown in Fig. 1 . 
Results showed stable PCR signals from each samples and demonstrated stable transcript levels of tmRNA in all samples from early exponential to late stationary phase . 
Statistical Analysis results showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference ( p > 0 05 ) between relative abundance of RNA samples from each growth phase . 
Similar results were observed in samples from cultures with different pH. However , the notable decrease in bacteria quantity suggested that Salmonella growth was inhibited at low pH. 
Ability of One-step RT-qPCR assay to discriminate between viable and dead S. enterica cells
Heating treatment was used to kill viable Salmonella cells . 
Then , plate enumeration and one-step RT-qPCR assay were used to detect Salmonella cells ( Table 1 ) . 
No growth was observed on plates of heat-treated samples , indicating that heat inactivation was effective . 
Meanwhile , no ampli-ﬁcation signals were obtained in one-step RT-qPCR assay using RNA prepared from heat-inactivated cells . 
In short , these results demonstrated that one-step RT-qPCR can be used for the detection of viable Salmonella cells .

Detection of Salmonella in artiﬁcially contaminated fresh-cut vegetables
Fourteen artiﬁcial contaminated fresh-cut vegetables were used to investigate the ability of one-step RT-qPCR assay to detect viable Salmonella cells ( Table 2 ) in fresh-cut products . 
Without enrichment , this assay could detect 10 CFU per g for fresh-cut lettuce , cilantro , spinach , cabbage , Chinese cabbage and bell pepper , and could detect 10 CFU per g for other vegetables . 
With a 6-h enrich-2 ment , this assay could detect 10 CFU per g for all freshcut vegetables used in this study . 
For all assays in this study , Ct values of Internal Ampliﬁcation Control ( IAC ) ranged from 20 to 26 . 
Un-inoculated vegetable controls and PCR controls with ultrapure water template did not produce ampliﬁcation curves in the ﬁrst 40 cycles .

As the standard method of Salmonella detection and identiﬁcation , the combination of plate counts and biochemical assays usually takes several days to obtain a deﬁnitive result . 
In recent years , real-time PCR based assays have been developed for the rapid detection of Salmonella spp . 
in a variety of foods , many of which are based on the detection of virulence genes or function genes in Salmonella . 
The reported qPCR assays employed ﬂuorescent detection technologies mainly including SYBR Green dye or TaqMan probe . 
Assays whether or not to adopt the enrichment process are available in literatures . 
Assays including an enrichment step were generally more sensitive than those without 
levels were exhibited as Ct value of one-step RT-qPCR .

enrichment , but they can only give qualitative ( presence or absence ) instead of quantitative results . 
The time utilized in enrichment step ranged from 3 h to 24 h to detect Sal-monella using real-time PCR or PCR ( Gonzalez-Escalona et al. 2009 ; Fachmann et al. 2017 ) . 
In the present study , we demonstrated that a 6-h enrichment was necessary for one-step RT-qPCR assay to improve the recovery and detection of low inocula levels ( < 102 CFU per g ) of Salmonella cells in most fresh-cut vegetable samples . 
In addition , the difference on Ct values of some spiked vegetables ( lettuce , spinach and cabbage ) with or without a 6-h enrichment was smaller than expected , which implied that 6-h enrichment is less effective for these vegetables . 
First , this may be due to the interference from vegetable matrices and microbes , which could attach or interact with Salmonella bacteria ( Patel and Sharma 2010 ) . 
Some of these interference could be eliminated by enrichment , and others could not . 
Second , the notable decrease in bacteria quantity under lower pH suggested the pool tolerance of Salmonella to acidic circumstance , indicating that an enrichment procedure was necessary for some samples to provide suitable growth environment such as pH , osmotic pressure , carbon source , nitrogen source and so on . 
Lettuce , spinach and cabbage may have less inﬂuence on bacterial growth , thus beneﬁting less from enrichment step . 
Additional experiments are needed to explore this phenomenon . 
Nevertheless , adopting a short 6-h enrichment together with a one-step reverse transcript and qPCR assay , it still exhibits rapid detection capability , less chance for cross-contamination and requires less labour . 
Many of previous studies are based on the detection of virulence genes or function genes in Salmonella . 
One of the most widely used target genes was the invA gene . 
However , expression level of invA gene was affected by environmental milieu and growth status of Salmonella ( GarcaA et al. 2010 ; O'Leary et al. 2015 ) . 
In some cases , the expression of the invA gene is as low as 4 copies per 10 CFU ( Gonzalez-Escalona et al. 2009 ) . 
However , ssrA 3 gene encoding tmRNA , is present in all bacteria ( Keiler et al. 2000 ) and is a strong candidate for PCR tests with a high transcript level . 
For example , there were about 923 copies of tmRNA per CFU in Streptococcus pneumonia and 1063 copies of tmRNA per CFU Staphylococcus aur-eus ( Glynn et al. 2012 ) . 
Previous study has demonstrated the versatility of tmRNA as the target for the speciﬁc detection of Salmonella species ( McGuinness et al. 2009 ) . 
In the subsequent study , they ﬁgured out that using tmRNA as the detection target signiﬁcantly earlier Ct values than DNA could be observed , suggesting presumably at least 100 copies of tmRNA per ssrA gene ( McGuinness et al. 2012 ) . 
In the present study , we have obtained results showing that transcript levels of tmRNA is basically stable at different growth stages and under a range of pH. Based on these results , it could be concluded that tmRNA is a potentially valuable target suitable for one-step RT-qPCR detection and may reduce the limit of detection and shorten the detection time . 
LOD of one-step RT-qPCR was assessed using 10-fold serially diluted RNA ( 0 6 lg ll 1 ) from 106 CFU per ml bacteria culture . 
The results showed that 10 - fold diluted RNA sam-6 ples were detected by one-step RT-qPCR , suggesting that the LOD could be as low as about 1 0 CFU per ml . 
On the assumption that there are about hundreds copies of tmRNA per ssrA gene in Salmonella ( McGuinness et al. 2012 ) , LOD of this assay could be considered as about hundreds of copies tmRNA per ml . 
Taking into account the quantity of total RNA used for RT-qPCR , this was close to the limit of 3 -- 14 copies/PCR which is typically regarded as the limit of detection for real-time PCR ( Bustin et al. 2009 ) . 
Then , RT-qPCR assay was applied to detect viable Salmonella cells in 14 freshcut vegetables after 6-h storage . 
The difference between LODs of bacteria culture and fresh-cut vegetables may be attributed to the following factors . 
First , this may due to the interference from vegetable matrices , which could attach or interact with Salmonella bacteria ( Patel and Sharma 2010 ) and cause cell loss during cell recovery . 
Second , plant tissue usually contains more secondary metabolites , so that interference from vegetable matrices may have considerably negative effect on RNA extraction efﬁciency . 
Third , free RNA has a shorter half-life than DNA due to the ubiquitous RNA-degrading enzyme especially in the mix of vegetable residues and culture buffer , so that only intracellular RNA could be detected in RT-qPCR assay . 
Thus , in a single sample at least one or more viable cells should be included and disrupted to discharge RNA . 
However , bacteria cells may be unevenly distributed in solution , which forms the bottleneck of RT-qPCR detection . 
It should be of value on developing an effective enrichment method to gather and reproduce bacteria cells from large volume of target solution or large weight of target samples . 
The 6-h storage at 8 °C before detection did not seem to have a serious impact on detection capability , however , several of the above discussions are related to the interaction between bacteria and matrices during storage . 
Considering that Salmonella attachment to vegetable surfaces increased with time ( Patel and Sharma 2010 ) , further study is needed . 
In conclusion , one-step reverse transcript qPCR assay with a TaqMan probe targeting tmRNA was applied for the detection of Salmonella spp . 
in fresh-cut vegetables in this study . 
The LOD of this assay was 1 0 CFU per ml for bacteria culture , and 10 CFU per g for a variety of inoculated vegetables with a 6-h enrichment process . 
Moreover , we also proved that this assay was able to discriminate viable cells from dead cells .

RNA extraction and quality analysis
The total RNA of Salmonella bacteria was extracted using a RNAprep Pure Bacteria Kit ( Tiangen Biotech Co. , Ltd. , Beijing , China ) . 
Experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the operating manual , and the RNA was treated by DNase I to remove genomic DNA followed by washing with protein elimination buffer . 
Finally , the RNA was dried at room temperature for 15 min , suspended in 30 ll of RNase-Free distilled water , and stored at 80 °C until further use . 
RNA was quantiﬁed by measuring 260/280 nm absor-bance using a Cintra 404 UV-Visible Spectrometer ( GBC Scientiﬁc Equipment Ltd. ) . 
The integrity of RNA was analysed using 1 2 % denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the quality . 
Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
The DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed and quantiﬁed using a KAPA PROBE FAST Universal One-step RT-qPCR Kit . 
The kit is designed for rapid real-time PCR using RNA template , containing reverse transcriptase and PCR enzyme . 
Reverse transcription and RT-qPCR reactions were performed using a QuantStudioTM 7 FLEX REAL-TIME PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . 
E. coli ssrA gene was ampliﬁed using primers ( Entero-tm-T7 F : 50-TAATACGACTCACTA TAGGGGCTGATTCTGGATTCGA-30 and Entero-tm R : 50-TGGTGGAGCTGGCGGGA-30 ) to add upstream T7 promoter region ( underlined sequence ) . 
PCR product was used as template to yield RNA transcripts in vitro using the TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) according to manufacturer 's instructions . 
RNA transcripts of E. coli ssrA gene were then used as Internal Ampliﬁcation Control ( IAC ) . 
IAC primers ( Entero-tm F : 50-GGGGCTGATTCTGGA TTCGA-30 and Entero-tm R ) and probe ( JOE-TCAAA 
CCCAAAAGAGATCGCGTGGA-BHQ2 ) , together with ssrA primers ( FPF : 50-CCTCGTAAAAAGCCGCA-30 , and FPR : 50-GAGTTGAACCCGCGTC-30 ) and probes ( SAM 1 : FAM-CAAACGACGAAACCTACGCTTTAGC-BHQ1 and SAM 2 : FAM-AGACTAGCCTGATTCGTTTTAACGCT-B 
HQ1 ) were previously described ( McGuinness et al. 2009 ) , except that some ﬂuorescent label or quencher was changed according to the instructions of the PCR system . 
A reaction system of 20 ll with 1 ll total RNA , 400 nmol 1 1 l of each primer , 200 nmol l target and IAC probes , 0 02 fg IAC RNA , 0 4 ll Reverse Transcription Mix and 10 ll 29 PROBE FAST Master Mix ( KAPA Biosystems , Boston , MA ) was used . 
Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 15 min , followed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min . 
The subsequent thermal cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min ; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Negative controls with ultrapure water template were performed for each PCR set . 
PCR running control , baseline correction , determination of cycle thresholds ( Ct ) value and reaction efﬁciency , and generation of standard curve were performed using QuantStudioTM 7 FLEX REAL-TIME PCR software v1 .2 ( Applied Biosystems , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Foster City , CA , USA ) . 
Three biological replicates were used in all experiments . 
Standard curve was generated using 10-fold serial 6 dilutions of total RNA from 1 ml 10 CFU per ml Sal-monella cocktail which was mixed with cultures of three strains in exponential phase . 
Ct values were plotted against the CFU concentrations ( CFU per ml ) . 
Reaction efﬁciency of RT-qPCR was calculated using the slope of the standard curve ( i.e. efﬁciency = 10 1/slope 1 ) . 
Detection of Salmonella tmRNA at different growth phases
Cultures of ATCC 9270 , ATCC 13076 and ATCC14028 were grown in TSB overnight , and 1 ml of each culture were inoculated to 100 ml TSB . 
Salmonella growth during a 24-h period was monitored by measuring the OD600 nm absorption . 
Samples were collected at 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 15 and 24 h for RNA isolation . 
The RNA of each samples were extracted and diluted to the same concentration , then equal amount of total RNA ( 100 ng for each PCR reaction ) was used for RT-qPCR to investigate the effect of growth status on expression of the ssrA gene . 
Each experiment was replicated three times . 
Detection of Salmonella tmRNA under different pH
Cultures of ATCC 9270 , ATCC 13076 and ATCC 14028 were grown overnight , then 10 ml of each culture were inoculated to 90 ml TSB with initial pH of 4 0 , 4 5 , 5 0 , 5 5 , 6 0 , 6 5 and 7 0 , which covered pH range of common vegetables . 
After a 12-h growth , each sample was collected for RNA isolation . 
The RNA was extracted and diluted to the same concentration , then equal amount of total RNA ( 100 ng for each PCR reaction ) was used for RT-qPCR to investigate the effect of pH on expression of the ssrA gene . 
Each experiment was replicated three times . 
Discrimination between viable and dead Salmonella cells 
Three groups of Salmonella cocktail , including a viable cell group , a dead cell group and a viable : dead cell mixed group , were used to evaluate the ability of RT-qPCR to discriminate between viable and dead cells as described previously . 
Viable group was constructed using heating treatment process ( autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min ) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 12 -- 24 h to kill viable cells of Salmonella cocktail in TSB . 
A group of non-trea-ted Salmonella cocktail samples were used as the viable group . 
Heat-treated culture and viable culture were converged equally to make a viable : dead ( 1 : 1 ) mixture . 
Then plate enumeration and one-step RT-qPCR assay were used to detect Salmonella cells . 
Preparation of Fresh-cut vegetables and inoculation
Fourteen vegetables ( listed in Table 2 ) used in this study were purchased from local markets , all processing and packaging processes were carried out in a clean bench . 
The processing of leaf vegetables included the removal of roots and old leaves , followed by washing and drying . 
The processing of Gourd and fruit vegetables included washing and drying . 
Root and tuber vegetables were peeled and split to pieces after cleaning . 
Prior to inoculation , the fresh-cut vegetables were placed in open sterile petri dishes under ultraviolet light to dry for 10 min at room temperature . 
Twenty-ﬁve gram of each vegetable was individually inoculated with a range concentration ( ﬁnal concentration of 10 5 to 10 CFU per g ) of Salmonella cocktail and allowed 0 to dry for 10 min at room temperature in clean bench . 
Then all vegetables samples were packaged with poly-ethylene ﬁlm and stored at 8 °C for 6-h to mimic an actually process and storage procedure . 
Each experiment was replicated three times , while uninoculated vegetables were produced as controls . 
Recovery and extraction of bacteria from inoculated vegetables
After storage , Salmonella cells were recovered using 25 ml saline buffer with 0 05 mol l glycine in a sterile 1 stomach bag . 
The stomach bags with samples were hand rubbed for about 1 min . 
Rinse buffer was centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet was used for RNA isolation . 
For comparison , an additional set with a short enrichment process was carried out for samples inoculated with low inocula levels ( ﬁnal concentration of 
10 to 10 CFU per g ) . 
Twenty-ﬁve gram Fresh-cut veg-2 0 etable with 225 ml BPW were stomached for 2 min and transferred to a sterilized conical ﬂask . 
The enrichment was carried out by incubation at 200 rev min at 37 °C 1 for 6-h . 
Bacteria cultures were centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min at 4 °C , and the cell pellet was used for RNA isolation . 
The RNA was extracted and diluted to the same concentration , then equal amount of total RNA ( 200 ng for each PCR reaction ) was used for RT-qPCR
