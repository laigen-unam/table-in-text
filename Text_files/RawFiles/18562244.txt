info 
Four 2-phenylbenzotriazole ( PBTA ) - type compounds ( PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 ) were identi-ﬁed as major mutagens in blue cotton/rayon-adsorbed substances collected at sites below textile dyeing factories or municipal water treatment plants treating domestic waste and efﬂuents from textile dyeing factories in several rivers in Japan . 
The main purpose of this study is to understand the basis of the roles of human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) and N-acetyltransferases ( NATs ) in genotoxic activation of PBTA derivatives . 
We compared the induction of umuC gene expression as a measure of genotoxicity using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 ( parental strain ) , NM2009 ( bacterial O-acetyltransferase-overexpressing strain ) established in our laboratories . 
PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 induced the umuC gene expression more strongly in the bacterial O-acetyltransferase-overproducing strain than in the parental strain in the presence of rat S9 mix . 
We determined the activation of PBTA derivatives by cDNA-based recombinant ( Trichoplusia ni ) systems expressing human or rat cytochrome P450 enzymes ( P450 or CYP ) and NADPH-P450 reductase using S. typhimurium NM2009 . 
The results showed that human recombinant CYP1A1 enzyme was much more active than CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in the genotoxic activation of PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 . 
Similarly , rat recombinant CYP1A1 enzyme catalyzed the activation of these chemicals at high rates . 
- Naphthoﬂavone , a known inhibitor of CYP1A1 , was found to inhibit genotoxic activation caused by PBTA derivatives . 
We further determined the activation of PBTA derivatives using S. typhimurium NM6001 ( human NAT1-expressing strain ) , S. typhimurium NM6002 ( human NAT2-expressing strain ) , and S. typhimurium NM6000 ( O-AT-deﬁcient parent strain ) in the presence of S9 mix . 
PBTA-4 showed almost similar sensitivity in the NAT1-expressing strain and the NAT2-expressing strain , although NAT2-expressing strain exhibited relatively higher sensitivity to PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 than NAT1-expressing strain . 
The results support the view that O-acetylation by human NAT1 and NAT2 enzymes is involved in the genotoxic activation of PBTA compounds . 
These results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that human P4501A1 and NATs ( NAT1 and NAT2 ) contribute signiﬁcantly to the activation of PBTA-type compounds to genotoxic metabolites that induce umuC gene expression in S. typhimurium tester strains .

1. Introduction
A number of studies have shown that river waters are contaminated by genotoxic and/or carcinogenic substances and the mutagenic potency of industrial wastewaters from pulp and paper mills , steel foundries and organic chemical manufacturing facilities has been reported [ 1 -- 3 ] . 
It is important to identify the sources of toxic substances in the environment and to effectively reduce contamination levels . 
We have recently identiﬁed seven PBTA-type compou-nds that have genotoxic and mutagenic activities , i.e. 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -4 - [ bis ( 2-methoxyethyl ) amino ] -5 - methoxyphenyl ] - 5-amino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-1 ) [ 4 ] , 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -4 - [ N - ( 2-cyanoethyl ) ethylamino ] -5 - methoxyph - enyl ] -5 - amino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-2 ) [ 5 ] , 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -4 - [ ( 2-hydroxyethylethyl ) - amino ] -5 - methox-yphenyl ] -5 - amino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-3 ) [ 6 ] , 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -4 - amino-5-methoxyphenyl ] -5 - amino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-4 ) [ 7 ] , 2 - [ 2 - ( acety-lamino ) -4 - [ bis ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) amino ] -5 - methoxyphenyl ] -5 - am - ino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-6 ) [ 8 ] , 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -4 - ( diethylamino ) -5 - methoxyphenyl ] -5 - amino-7 - - bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-7 ) , and 2 - [ 2 - ( acet-ylamino ) -4 - ( diallylamino ) -5 - methoxyphenyl ] -5 - amino-7-bromo - 4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole ( PBTA-8 ) [ 9 ] . 
These compounds were found to be major mutagens in concentrates from several rivers that ﬂow in geographically different areas in Japan containing textile-related industries [ 9 ] . 
It has been shown that these PBTA derivatives , except for PBTA-6 , were formed from corresponding dinitrophenylazo dyes via reduction by sodium hydrosulﬁte and subsequent chlorination with sodium hypochlorite [ 7 -- 10 ] . 
These compounds have 2 - [ 2 - ( acetylamino ) -5 - methoxyphenyl ] -5 - amino-7-bromo-4-chloro-2H-benzotriazole moiety in common , and show strong mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) TA98 and YG1024 in the presence of S9 mix [ 7 -- 9 ] . 
It is reported that PBTA-1 and PBTA-2 have genotoxic activities in mammalian cell lines in vitro [ 11,12 ] , and PBTA-6 has a genotoxic effect in goldﬁsh in vivo [ 13 ] ; however , it is not known at present whether mammalian enzymes are related to the activation of these chemicals to genotoxic metabolites . 
PBTA-type compounds have been reported to require metabolic activation to exert their genotoxic activity [ 7 -- 9 ] . 
This activation is considered to occur primarily through N-oxidation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 ( P450 or CYP ) enzyme , followed by subsequent O-acetylation of N-hydroxy metabolites by N-acetyltransferase 
( NATs ) , leading to form ultimate genotoxic products . 
The purposes of this study were : ( 1 ) to examine the genotoxicity of PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 using SOS/umu assay based on S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 ( parental strain ) and NM2009 ( bacterial O-acetyltransferase-overexpressing strain ) ; ( 2 ) to determine the genotoxic activation of these chemicals by recombinant ( T. ni cells ) human or rat P450 enzymes in S. typhimurium NM2009 ; ( 3 ) to further determine the potential role of human NATs ( NAT1 and NAT2 ) in the bioactivation of these chemicals using S. typhimurium NM6000 ( O-AT-deﬁcient parent strain ) , NM6001 ( NAT1-overexpressing strain ) , and NM6002 ( NAT2-overexpressing strain ) . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and enzymes
Four PBTA compounds ( PBTA-4 ( CAS 351995-07-8 ) , PBTA-6 ( CAS 392274-07-6 ) , PBTA-7 ( CAS 468062-49-9 ) , and PBTA-8 ( CAS 468062-50-2 ) ) , shown in Fig. 1 , were synthesized according to the methods reported previously [ 7 -- 9 ] . 
The purities of PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 were higher than 99 % by HPLC . 
All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity commercially available . 
Rat liver S9 fractions and cofactor for S9 mix were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co. ( Tokyo , Japan ) . 
Recombinant CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , and CYP3A4 expressed in microsomes of T. ni cells infected with a baculovirus containing human P450 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase cDNA inserts were obtained from GENTEST ( Woburn , MA , USA ) ; the P450 contents in these systems are described in the data sheets provided by the 
manufactures . 
2.2. Bacterial strains
The umu tester strains employed in this study were S. typhimurium NM2009 ( bacterial O-acetyltransferase-overexpression strain ) and S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 ( parent strain ) to examine the roles of O-AT with PBTA derivatives [ 14 -- 16 ] . 
S. typhimurium NM6001 ( human NAT1-expressing strain ) , S. typhimurium NM6002 ( human NAT2-expressing strain ) , and S. typhimurium NM6000 ( S. typhimurium TA1538/1 ,8 - DNP , O-AT-deﬁcient strain ) were also used to investigate the roles of human NATs using these chemicals . 
NAT enzyme activities in the three strains used were determined by the methods described previously [ 17 ] . 
2.3. Genotoxicity assay in the presence of S9 mix
The umu assay was carried out according to the procedure described by Oda et al. [ 15 -- 17 ] . 
Overnight culture of bacterial tester strains was grown in Luria broth medium , including chloramphenicol ( 10 g/ml ) and/or ampicillin ( 25 g/ml ) for NM2009 and TA1535/pSK1002 strains [ 16 ] , and tetracycline HCl ( 1 g/ml ) and/or ampicillin ( 25 g/ml ) for NM6001 , NM6002 , and NM6000 strains [ 17 ] . 
The overnight culture was diluted 50-fold with TGA medium ( 1 % Bacto tryptone ( w/v ) , 0.5 % NaCl ( w/v ) , 0.2 % glucose ( w/v ) , and 20 g/ml ampicillin ) . 
The culture was incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦ C and 1-ml aliquots of TGA culture ( OD600 : 0.25 -- 0.3 ) , 0.15 ml of S9 mix and 10 l tester compound dissolved in DMSO were mixed and further incubated for 2 h. Induction of umuC gene expression as a response to DNA damage was determined by measuring cellular - galactosidase activity [ 14 ] . 
The cytotoxic effect of chemicals on bacterial cells was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm . 
The results are presented as the means of two or three independent experiments , as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 .

2.4. Genotoxicity assay using recombinant CYP enzymes
P450-dependent activation of PBTA derivatives to reactive products that cause the induction of umuC gene expression in tester strain S. typhimurium NM2009 was determined as described by Shimada et al. [ 18 ] . 
Brieﬂy , the overnight culture was diluted 50-fold with TGA medium ( 1 % Bacto tryptone ( w/v ) , 0.5 % NaCl ( w/v ) , 0.2 % glucose ( w/v ) , and 20 g/ml ampicillin ) . 
The culture was incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦ C and then 0.75 ml aliquots of TGA culture ( OD600 : 0.25 -- 0.3 ) and human or rat P450 ( 10 pmole ) and 5.0 M PBTA derivatives in a ﬁnal volume of 1.0 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) containing an NADPH-generating system , consisting of 0.5 mM NADP + , 5 mM glucose 6-phosphate , and 0.5 units of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase per ml [ 19 ] were mixed and further incubated for 3 h . 
The induction of umuC gene expression was monitored as described above

3. Results
3.1. Comparison of genotoxic activities of PBTA derivatives in NM2009 and TA1535/pSK1002
In order to evaluate whether the O-AT-overexpressing NM2009 strain has higher sensitivity than the parent TA1535/pSK1002 strain for detecting genotoxic activities of PBTA derivatives , we compared the inducibility of umuC gene expression and cytotoxicity of four compounds in these tester strains ( Fig. 2 ) . 
PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 were found to be more highly genotoxic and cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner in O-AT-overexpression strain NM2009 after metabolic activation than a TA1535/pSK1002 strain . 
In addition , when genotoxic and cytotoxic sensitivities were assessed from detecting twofold increase ofgalactosidase activities above the control levels and as % of control , respectively , in the dose -- response curves of these chemicals , the order of sensitivity for genotoxic and cytotoxic activities in the NM2009 strain was found to be PBTA-4 > PBTA-7 = PBTA-8 > PBTA-6 . 
3.2. Metabolic activation of PBTA derivatives by recombinant P450 enzymes
We determined the activation of PBTA derivatives by three forms of recombinant ( T. ni cells ) human P450 enzymes and recombinant rat P450 1A1 ( Escherichia coli cells ) enzyme , and these were coexpressed with human and rat NADPH-P450 reductase ( Table 1 ) . 
CYP1A1 was found to activate all of the PBTA compounds . 
Other P450 enzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP3A4 ) did not activate these chemicals at signiﬁcant rates . 
3.3. Effect of ˛-naphthoﬂavone on induction of umuC gene expression by PBTA derivatives
Because - naphthoﬂavone ( - NF ) has been shown to be a selective inhibitor of P450 1A family enzymes , we examined whether - NF inhibits the genotoxicity induced by PBTA derivatives in strain NM2009 ( Table 2 ) . 
The induction of umuC gene expression by PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 was inhibited by 25 % , 52 % , 33 % , and 35 % , respectively , by the addition of - NF . 
3.4. Comparison of genotoxic activities of PBTA derivatives in NM6000, NM6001, and NM6002 strains
To examine the roles of human NAT , NAT1 or NAT2 , in the bioactivation of PBTA derivatives , we compared three tester strains expressing NAT1-expressing strain ( NM6001 ) , NAT2-expressing strain ( NM6002 ) , and the parent strain ( NM6000 ) in the induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals ( Fig. 3 ) . 
When the genotoxicity of PBTA derivatives in these strains was expressed by the ratio to the control ( 0 M of these derivatives ) , the induction of umuC gene expression by PBTA-4 was almost similar in the NAT1-expressing strain and the NAT2-expressing strain , although the NAT2-expressing strain exhibited relatively higher sensitivity than the NAT1-expressing strain in inducing the umuC gene by PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 ; however , the NM6000 strain was not found to be sensitive to all of these chemicals . 
4. Discussion
2-Phenylbenzotriazole-type compounds have been shown to be potent promutagens that were identiﬁed recently in river water samples from several sites in Japan [ 10 ] . 
Most of these promutagens are novel chemicals and are thought to be formed unintentionally by the reaction of parental chemicals with unknown environmental factors . 
Because the SOS/umu assay provided a sensitive method for detecting potential mutagens and carcinogens in environmental samples [ 21 -- 23 ] , we compared the sensitivity of an O-AT-overexpressing strain NM2009 with the parental strain TA1535/pSK1002 in terms of their abilities to induce cytotoxicity responses and the induction of umuC gene expression by four PBTA derivatives in the presence of rat S9 mix . 
These chemicals were found to be more cytotoxic and genotoxic in the NM2009 strain than in the parent TA1535/pSK1002 strain , indicating that these compounds are oxidized by P450 enzymes to convert an exocyclic amino group to a hydroxylamine group , which is then activated to form the N-acetoxy derivative with O-AT . 
Thus , the results obtained in this study demonstrated that PBTA derivatives are activated to potent SOS genotoxins . 
Among recombinant ( T. ni ) CYP enzymes used , in all three lots of CYP1B1 preparations high basal activities of - galactosidase in S. typhimurium NM2009 were determined ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , we found that this CYP1B1 preparation could not be used to examine genotoxic activation in our assay system . 
The ﬁnding has also bee reported by Shimada et al. [ 24 ] . 
Further work will be needed to address this problem . 
Using human recombinant CYP enzymes ( CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , CYP3A4 ) in T. ni cells , we examined the involvement of human CYPs in the metabolic activation of PBTA compounds . 
Of the human recombinant CYPs tested , CYP1A1 was found to be efﬁcient in activating these chemicals . 
Additionally , we found that the representative CYP1A1 inhibitor - naphthoﬂavone inhibits the induction of umuC gene expression by activated metabolites of PBTA-4 , PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 in strain NM2009 ( Table 2 ) : the inhibition of these chemicals was 25 % , 52 % , 33 % , and 35 % , respectively . 
Furthermore , we showed the similar efﬁciency of rat recombinant CYP1A1 in PBTA activation ( Table 1 ) . 
Taken together , these results indicate that CYP1A1 may contribute substantially to the metabolic activation of PBTA compounds . 
It has been accepted that aromatic amines are mainly catalyzed by CYP1A2 in experimental animal models and humans [ 25 ] . 
Interestingly , although the PBTA compounds used in this study were aromatic amines , they were activated by the CYP1A1 enzyme to exert their genotoxicity , but not by the CYP1A2 enzyme . 
It should be noted that CYP1A1 was able to catalyze the activation of PBTA compounds . 
It is known that CYP1A1 is expressed at considerable levels in lung and liver tissues [ 26,27 ] , and this enzyme could play an important role in PBTA compound-related genotoxicity or carcinogenicity in target tissue such as the lung . 
Previous work has shown that PBTA derivatives have strong mutagenic activities in the S. typhimurium YG1024 strain overexpressing bacterial O-AT than in the TA98 strain [ 7 -- 9 ] . 
In the present study , we found that they induce potent umuC gene expression in the S. typhimurium NM2009 strain . 
In order to examine the possible roles of human NAT enzymes in the bioactivation of genotoxic PBTA derivatives , we compared the sensitivities of two strains expressing human NAT1 and NAT2 and the parent strain to these compounds on the induction of umuC gene expression . 
PBTA-4 showed almost similar sensitivity in the NAT1-expressing strain and the NAT2-expressing strain , although NAT2-expressing strain NM6002 exhibited relatively higher sensitivity to PBTA-6 , PBTA-7 , and PBTA-8 than NAT1-expressing strain NM6001 . 
The results support the view that O-acetylation by human NAT1 and NAT2 enzymes is involved in the genotoxic activation of PBTA compounds . 
In addition , O-sulfonation by sulfotransferase ( SULT ) as phase II enzymes could be considered to be involved in the metabolic activation of these chemicals . 
We tested the induction of umuC gene expression by PBTA compounds in the presence of S9 mix using tester strains expressing human SULT1A1 , SULT1A2 , and SULT1A3 ; however , these compounds did not show any signiﬁcant umuC induction in these strains ( data not shown ) . 
In conclusion , the present results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that CYP1A1 and NATs are important enzymes participating in the genotoxic activation of PBTA-type compounds , and may also indicate important roles of these enzymes in tumor development through metabolic activation of these compounds in target cells .
