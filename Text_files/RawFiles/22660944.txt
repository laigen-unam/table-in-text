Molecular d active site analysis of Sdi putative quorum sensor for Salmonella typhimurium pathogenecity reveals specific binding patterns of A transcriptional regulators
The Gram-negative bacilli , S. typhimurium is the most prev-alent food borne pathogen that causes enteric fever ( typhoid ) and gastroenteritis in human [ 1 , 2 ] . 
The important survival strategy of S. typhimurium is colonization during infection . 
Many countries documented outbreaks associated with drug-resistant S. typhimurium in humans , poultry , cattle , and swine [ 3 , 4 ] . 
Emerging antibiotic resistance of S. typhimurium in both humans and animals is a serious and potential public health problem [ 5 , 6 ] . 
Many Gram-negative bacteria including S. typhimurium employ a cell -- cell signaling system referred to as quorum sensing ( QS ) to control the expression of several genes in response to its population size . 
In S. typhimurium virulence gene clusters SPI1 ( Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ) and spv ( Salmonella plasmid virulence ) are under the control of population density [ 7 ] . 
This phenomenon is mediated by a signal molecule 's N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) often known as auto inducers which generally binds to and actives its cognate receptor ( LuxR homologs ) [ 8 -- 10 ] . 
S. typhimurium encodes a LuxR homolog , SdiA ( suppressor of cell division inhibition ) but does not encode an AHL synthase ( LuxI homolog ) [ 11 , 12 ] . 
Hence the acyl homoserin lactone ( AHL ) signal molecules can not be produced by S. typhimurium itself . 
Instead it responds to the AHL signals produced by the other bacterial species [ 13 ] . 
For instance , Salmonella SdiA is functional during co-infection with an AHL producing pathogen Y. enterocolitica , and the regulated genes promoted by SdiA are involved in Salmonella 's colonization of the intestine [ 14 , 15 ] . 
The expression of virulence gene network by the activated SdiA is illustrated in Fig. 1 . 
AHLs produced by other bacterial species such as Y. enterocolitica diffuse across the membrane and are bound by SdiA . 
SdiA then increases the expression of the genes found on the virulence plasmid pSLT . 
These genes include pefI , srgD , srgA , srgB , rck , and srgC [ 16 , 17 ] . 
srgE ( SdiA-regulated gene E ) is a chromosomal gene regulated by SdiA that also appears to be found on the virulence plasmid pSLT [ 13 ] . 
sirA ( Salmonella invasion regulator ) is a response regulator and an apparent `` housekeeping '' also at the regulatory cascade of SdiA . 
The Salmonella pathogenecity island 1 ( SPI1 ) is regulated by sirA regulating motility and invasion functions and directly regulates the activation of the hilA and hilC expression encoding a type III and type I secretion systems and csrB expression which encodes RNA-binding protein [ 18 ] . 
In the present study , the quorum sensing enhanced transcriptional regulator SdiA from S. typhimurium was chosen as a potential drug target due to its manifestation in regulating the genes involved in colonization and virulence factors and modeled using homology modeling method . 
In addition the molecular docking studies between AHL auto inducer and SdiA , and the other three LuxR homolog 's LasR from P. aeruginosa , TraR from A. tumifaciens and CviR from C. violaceum were pursued to find the unique binding patterns of SdiA , which will be helpful in designing potential inhibitors for quorum sensing .

Abstract Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for human diseases including gastroenter-itis and typhoid fever and its quorum sensing system is currently being intensively researched . 
Molecular modeling and binding site analysis of SdiA homolog , a putative quorum sensor of the LuxR family and responsible for S. typhimurium pathogenecity revealed a high structural homology of their active site with three other LuxR family proteins LasR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , TraR from Agrobacterium tumifaciens and CviR from Chromobacterium violaceum . 
The results show that all the LuxR family proteins harbor three conserved amino acids Tryptophan ( W67 ) and Aspartic acid ( D80 ) for formation of hydrogen bridges and Tyrosine ( Y71 ) for the hydrophobic interactions ( corresponding to their position in S. typhimurium SdiA ) with acyl homoserine lactones ( AHL ) -- dependent transcriptional regulators . 
However , in addition to the above conserved residues , Arginine ( R60 ) also plays an important role in S. typhimurium SdiA binding with its AHL auto inducers and the complex is found to be stronger because of the interactions between nitrogen atoms of 
Arginine with the carbonyl oxygen in the lactone ring of AHL . 
The specific binding patterns would be helpful in guiding both enzymatic studies as well as design of specific inhibitors to overcome S. typhimurium pathogenecity .

Materials and methods
Target sequence and potential template search
The quorum sensing cognate receptor of S. typhimurium , SdiA sequence was retrieved from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) [ 19 ] ( NCBI protein code EFX49656 ) . 
The homologous sequences were searched against PDB using NCBI-BlastP ( basic local alignment search tool ) [ 20 ] . 
The most homologous sequence obtained was considered as the potential template structure for homology modeling . 
The atomic co-ordinate file of the template structure was obtained from the PDB [ 21 ] . 
The ClustalW [ 22 ] program was used for sequence alignment and refinement of alignment errors as homology modeling relies on the sequence alignment 
Homology modeling of S. typhimurium SdiA
The final sequence alignment file of target and the template sequence and the atomic coordinate file of the template structure was used to build the model using the automated homology modeling software Modeler9v9 [ 23 ] that generates 3D model by satisfaction of spatial restraints . 
A bundle of 50 models from random generation of the starting structure was calculated and among the generated models , the best model with the least RMSD value was selected by superimposing the model with its template using SUPERPOSE [ 24 ] . 
This model was subjected for energy minimization by applying 20 steps of each steepest descent and conjugate gradient using GROMOS [ 25 ] of SwissPDBviewer and was used for further analysis .

Model assessment 
The quality of the generated model was assessed by checking the stereo chemical parameters using PROCHECK [ 26 ] , Verfiy3D [ 27 ] and ERRAT [ 28 ] at SAVES server [ 29 ] . 
The pdbsum [ 30 ] was used to predict the secondary structure conformations for the built model . 
Prediction of conserved residues among the LuxR family proteins
The LuxR family proteins from the following four species LasR from P. aeruginosa ( PDB ID : 2UV0 ) , TraR from A. tumifaciens ( PDB ID : 1L3L ) , CviR from C. violaceum ( PDB ID : 3QP5 ) and the developed model of SdiA from S. typhimurium were used for the prediction of conserved residues among the LuxR proteins . 
Multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW [ 22 ] was carried out among these four transcriptional regulators to trace out the homology and conserved residues . 
Prediction of binding site
To determine the binding affinities between S. typhimu-rium SdiA and its AHL auto inducers , the amino acids in the binding site of the developed model of SdiA was predicted through Q-site finder [ 31 ] . 
In addition , the binding sites of the other three LuxR family proteins LasR , TraR , and CviR from the other three species were also analyzed with their experimentally determined crystal structures with bound ligands . 
Finally , the binding site of SdiA was compared with binding sites of other LuxR family proteins to find the strictly conserved residues located in the active sites . 
Ligand generation and flexible docking
The AHL auto inducer molecules of Y. enterocolitica C6-Homoserine Lactone , C8-Homoserine Lactone , 3-Oxo-C6-Homoserine Lactone and 3-oxo-C8-Homoserine Lactone were drawn in ACD-Chemsketch [ 32 ] and their SMILES notation was obtained . 
They were converted into SDF files using ` Online SMILES convertor and Structure file generator ' [ 33 ] . 
The developed SDF structures were docked with the amino acids in the binding site of S. typhimurium SdiA using FlexX [ 34 ] with following parameters i ) default general docking informations , ii ) base placement using triangle matching , iii ) scoring of full score contribution and threshold of 0,30 and No score contribution and threshold of 0,70 . 
iv ) chemical parameters of clash handling values for protein ligand clashes with maximum allowed overlap volume of 2.9 A03 and intra-ligand clashes with clash factor of 0.6 and considering the hydrogen in internal clash tests . 
v ) default docking details values of 200 for both the maximum number of solutions per iteration and maximum number of solutions per fragmentation .

b Superimposition of the template C. violaceum CviR ( PDB ID : 3QP5 ) ( red ) and the generated model S. typhimurium SdiA ( yellow 
The interactions of AHL molecules with SdiA in the docked complex were analyzed by the pose-view of LeadIT [ 35 ] . 
The other three LuxR family proteins considered for this study , LasR , TraR , and CviR were the complexes of AHL receptors with their bound ligands and available in PDB databank [ 21 ] . 
LasR is a LuxR homolog bound with native ligand N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-HSL . 
Similarly TraR is a LuxR homolog bound with its ligand 3-oxo-Octanoic acid . 
CviR is a LuxR homolog bound to a potential anatagonist 4 - ( 4-chlorophenoxy ) N - [ ( 3S ) -2 - oxo tetrahydrofuran-3-yl butamide . 
The ligand receptor interactions in these LuxR homologs with the bound ligands were analyzed using the pose view of PDB Ligand Explorer [ 35 ] . 
Results and discussion
S. typhimurium, SdiA as drug target
S. typhimurium encode a single LuxR homolog named SdiA , but lack a corresponding LuxI homolog . 
The 
LuxI homologs in most of the Gram-negative bacteria generate the signal molecules known as AHL auto inducers . 
Usually these signals were detected by the LuxR homologs . 
However in S. typhimurium the LuxI homolog has not been present , indicating that it does not produce AHL of its own . 
Instead it responds to the signals produced by the other pathogenic bacteria such as Y. enetrocolitica [ 14 , 15 ] . 
Thus S. typhimurium path-ogenecity is most favorably expressed only during co-infection with other AHL producing pathogens . 
As SdiA is a transcriptional regulator of many of the virulent genes , it was considered as a potential drug target and modeled and reported in this work . 
Prediction of ligand - receptor interactions 
Sequence analysis and potential template for comparative modeling
The BLASTP analysis of target sequence of the transcriptional regulator SdiA from S. typhimurium , against PDB resulted that crystal structure of A-chain of CviR , LuxR - type transcriptional factor from C. violaceum ( PDB ID : 3QP5 ) as the most homologous sequence with the sequence identity of 40 % at an E-value cutoff of 4e-15 . 
As both the sequences belong to the same LuxR family the resultant homologous sequence was selected as template structure for homology modeling . 
The pair wise sequence alignment of target SdiA and the template CviR was refined using ClustalW and the alignment was shown in Fig. 2 .

Homology modeling of S. typhimurium SdiA
The sequence alignment file was used as input to build the initial model of SdiA using Modeler 9v9 by applying spatial restraints from the initial structure , a bundle of 50 models were developed using random generation and the best model was selected for further analysis based on its structural compatibility ( structure with lowest DOPE score ) . 
The modeled structure was shown in Fig. 3a . 
The quality of the model was accessed by the results of the server SUPERPOSE . 
SUPERPOSE compared the predicted structure of S. typhimurium SdiA to crystal structure of C. violaceum CviR , ( PDB ID : 3QP5 ) via superposition and was shown in Fig. 3b . 
The root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) of the modeled protein from the experimentally determined structure of C. violaceum CviR was found to be 0.80 A0 . 
As both sequences belong to LuxR family , their sequence identity ( 40 % ) and the low RMSD values suggested that this model is valid . 
The overall stereo chemical quality of the model was assessed by PROCHECK , Verfiy3D , and ERRAT of SAVES server . 
The Ramachandran plot of the energy minimized model of SdiA showed 88.7 % of the residues in the most favorable region , 9.9 % in the additionally allowed region , 0.5 % in the generously allowed region and 0.9 % in the disallowed region ; whereas the corresponding values for the C. violaceum CviR , template were 86.5 % , 13.1 % , 0.0 % and 0.5 % , respectively ( Fig. 4 ) . 
This ensures that the generated model was good when compared with the template structure which shows only 86.5 % of residues in most favored region . 
The total quality G-factor was − 0.15 . 
Further the overall quality factor and compatibility of an atomic model ( 3D ) with amino acid sequence ( 1D ) for the modeled protein SdiA was observed as 73.216 and 92.62 % from ERRAT and Verify3D respectively . 
Where as in the case of template C. violaceum CviR the values for ERRAT and Verify3D were 75.309 and 93.25 % respectively ( Table 1 ) . 
The results of ERRAT and Verify-3D also confirm the model was reliable and of good quality . 
The secondary structure prediction for the model showed 15 Helices , 5 Strands , 10 Beta turns , 3 Gamma turns and 3 Beta hairpins ( Fig. 5 ) indicating that the protein belongs to class alpha + beta . 
Conservation amino acid residues in active site region of SdiA and other LuxR family proteins
The validated and the final model of S. typhimurium SdiA was then used for finding conserved and active site residues in SdiA and similar LuxR homolog proteins from other species to evaluate its binding patterns with AHL auto inducer molecules .

( PDB ID : 3QP5 ) were aligned with the SdiA of S. typhimu-rium using the ClustalW program and the final alignment was optimized manually . 
The residues invariant across LuxR homologs were illustrated in Fig. 6 . 
Prediction of the binding site of S. typhimurium SdiA was carried-out using Q-site finder , which yields putative amino acid residues in the binding pocket . 
Similarly , the binding pocket for the other three LuxR proteins , LasR , TraR and CviR , whose crystal structures were already available in PDB database were obtained using ligand explorer [ 35 ] . 
The conserved amino acids observed all four LuxR proteins with their binding site residues and are shown in Table 2 .

Residues bind with ligand 
Dyszel et al. [ 14 ] reported that the Salmonella SdiA is functional only during the co-infection of AHL producing patho-gens . 
The studies of Throup et al. [ 36 ] reported that SdiA is consistent with specific preference to AHLs N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone ( C6-HSL ) , N - ( 3-oxohexanoyl ) homoserine lactone ( 3-oxo-C6-HSL ) , N-octanoyl homoserine lactone ( C8-HSL ) and N - ( 3-oxo-octanoyl ) homoserine lactone ( 3-oxo-C8-HSL ) produced by Y. enetrocolitica . 
These four AHL autoinducers , C6-HSL , 3-oxo-C6-HSL , C8-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL ( Fig. 7 ) from Y. enterocolitica were docked with modeled SdiA and also with its template CviR from C.violaceum using the docking program FlexX and the ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed using LeadIT . 
The other three LuxR homologous proteins , LasR from P. aeruginosa , TraR from A. tumifaciens and CviR from C. violaceum were also docked with their native ligands N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-HSL , 3-oxo-Octanoic acid and 4 - ( 4-chlor-ophenoxy ) N - [ ( 3S ) -2 - oxo tetrahydrofuran-3-yl butamide respectively and the binding interactions were studied . 
The docking interactions of the exogenous AHL mole-cules with modeled SdiA and its template CviR ( 3QP5 ) implies that the AHL molecule 3-oxo-C6-HSL has highest binding energy of -12.991 kJ mol-1 and -14.548 kJ mol-1 respectively and C8-HSL showed lowest binding energy of-9 .615 kJ mol-1 and -11.066 kJ mol-1 respectively . 
This observation suggests that the folding of SdiA would be the same as its template protein CviR and Table 3 summarizes these results . 
Figures 8 and 9 show the docking results of SdiA and the other three LuxR homologous proteins and Table 4 shows the corresponding amino acids with their specific binding energies favoring the interactions . 
The binding energy scores of the three LuxR homologous were distributed closely from -19.33 kJ mol-1 to -20.76 kJ mol-1 and in the case of SdiA from -9.61 kJ mol-1 to -12.99 kJ mol-1 . 
The binding energy scores of AHL auto inducers with SdiA showed greater variability when compare to the other three LuxR homologous . 
The overall docking results of AHL molecules with LuxR family proteins discloses the importance of lactone ring and the alkyl chains in AHL molecules in forming most of the interactions with the residues in the active site of LuxR family protein . 
The amino acids that interacted with AHL molecules were found to be Y56 , W60 , D73 , S129 in LasR , Y53 , W57 , D70 in TraR and W84 , Y88 , D97 in CviR . 
These findings suggested that the conserved Tryptophan ( W ) , Aspartic acid ( D ) and Tyrosine ( Y ) in the active site of LuxR family proteins are crucial for AHL binding . 
Similar binding interactions were also observed in the docking studies of S. typhimurium SdiA with AHL mole-cules . 
The conserved amino acids Tryptophan ( W67 ) , Aspartic acid ( D80 ) , Tyrosine ( Y71 ) and Arginine ( R60 ) were involved in the AHL interaction ( Fig. 9a -- d ) .

The docking studies of S. typhimurium SdiA and other LuxR family proteins with their respective AHL molecules implies that the electro negative element present in the lactone ring of AHL binds with Aspartic acid in the active site of LuxR family proteins . 
Whereas the carbonyl oxygen present in the lactone ring of AHL prefers to bind with Tyrosine residues in the active site . 
In SdiA , in addition to these interactions , the complex is found to be stronger because of the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between two nitrogen atoms of Arginine with the carbonyl oxygen in the lactone ring of AHL . 
Conclusions
The S. typhimurium transcriptional regulator SdiA , involves in the cross-chemical communication with different patho-gens which leads to co-infection . 
The AHLs produced by the Y. enterocolitica ( C6-HSL , C8-HSL , oxo-C6-HSL and oxo-C8-HSL ) binds to Salmonella SdiA to regulate the genes involved in pathogenicity , which are downstream to SdiA . 
Hence , SdiA is considered as a valid drug target . 
The binding mode of the AHL with SdiA might explain the potentiality of AHL analogous as quorum sensing inhibi-tors . 
Based on this , a model of SdiA was generated by comparative modeling and was validated . 
The binding mode of the AHLs was evaluated by docking studies . 
This work imparted that the conserved amino acids in the active site of LuxR family proteins Aspartic acid ( D ) , Tryptophan ( W ) and Tyrosine ( Y ) were involved in the binding of AHL . 
The interaction is favored by the bond formation with lactone ring and hydrophobic interaction with the alkyl chain of AHL . 
However , in SdiA , in addition to these interactions Arginine ( R60 ) is also found to be crucial in favoring the interactions and the complex is found to be stronger because of the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between two nitrogen atoms of Arginine with the carbonyl oxygen in the lactone ring of AHL . 
The present model and the binding features form the basis for further molecular studies on S. typhimurium SdiA quorum sensing inhibitor design which can serve as an alternate strategy for the treatment of diseases caused by S. typhimurium .
