Development of Salmonella Strains as Cancer Therapy Agents and Testing in Tumor Cell Lines
Abraham Eisenstark , Robert A. Kazmierczak , Alison Dino , Rula Khreis , Dustin Newman , and Heide Schatten 
Summary 
Despite significant progress in the development of new drugs and radiation , deaths due to cancer remain high . 
Many novel therapies are in clinical trials and offer better solutions , but more innovative approaches are needed to eradicate the various subpopulations that exist in solid tumors . 
Since 1997 , the use of bacteria for cancer therapy has gained increased attention . 
Salmonella Typhimurium strains have been shown to have a remarkably high affinity for tumor cells . 
The use of bacterial strains to target tumors is a relatively new research method that has not yet reached the point of clinical success . 
The first step in assessing the effectiveness of bacterial tumor therapy will require strain development and preclinical comparisons of candidate strains , which is the focus of this chapter . 
Several investigators have developed strains of Salmonella with reduced toxicity and capacity to deliver anti-tumor agents . 
Although methods for obtaining safe therapeutic strains have been relatively successful , there is still need for further genetic engineering before successful clinical use in human patients . 
As described by Forbes et al. in 2003 , the main stumbling block is that , while bacteria preferentially embed within tumor cells , they fail to spread within the tumor and finish the eradication process . 
Further engineering might focus on creating Salmonella that remove motility limitations , including increased affinity toward tumor-generated chemotactic attractants and induction of matrix-degrading enzymes .

1. Introduction
Although several species of bacteria have been investigated as anti-cancer agents , most of the current approaches are focused on strains of Salmonella . 
Investigators are exploring avenues that include ( 1 ) direct attachment , invasion , and destruction of tumor cells ; ( 2 ) bacteria as antigens for antibody production to specific tumor components ; ( 3 ) bacteria as vectors to deliver foreign antitumor agents ; ( 4 ) bacteria as agents that can metabolize accompanied drugs for greater effectiveness ; and ( 5 ) bacteria as partners with other therapeutic agents , such as cisplatin or radiation . 
This chapter focuses on methods for development of genetically modified Salmonella strains that optimize tumor destruction without toxic effects . 
It is limited to the rationale and methods for the first step in strain development , i.e. testing of strains in tumor cell lines . 
After strain construction and observations of Salmonella anti-tumor phenotypes in tissue cultures , the obvious choice for an experimental animal is the mouse , a natural host for Salmonella serovars and therefore suited for anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity testing . 
Although the strains being studied are engineered to be nontoxic , these strains were originally developed from assumed ancestral murine ( mouse ) pathogens , some with a history of food poisoning in humans . 
In any cancer therapy strategy , factors such as side effects , specificity , and a systemic delivery procedure to reach solid tumors must be considered . 
Advantages of developing special Salmonella strains as a delivery system include preferred migration to tumor cells versus non-tumor cells , non-toxicity , control with antibiotics , a large genomic reservoir for strain selection , engineering stimulation of the immune system at the tumor site , and the ability to deliver `` foreign '' genes by plasmid transfection and phage transduction . 
Salmonella characteristics such as motility ( 1,2 ) , facultative anaerobiosis ( 3 ) , and the ability to invade epithelial cells and engineered auxotrophies may contribute to successful interference of tumor growth ( see Table 1 ) . 
There are over 2500 described Salmonella serovars . 
A large fraction of these have disease histories that eliminate them from consideration . 
The particular serovar that has appeal for these studies is Salmonella enteritis serovar Typhimurium . 
Typhimurium is a murine pathogen that also infects humans and many other organisms . 
Results obtained from studies of bacterial/host tumor cell interactions in experimental animal models could reasonably be expected to resemble therapeutic outcomes in humans . 
Because the goal of Salmonella strain construction is to develop strain ( s ) for effective destruction of cancer tissue with minimal or no toxic effects , methods for achieving this goal depend on rational decisions , as described in this introduction . 
The specific methods will involve choice of strain , selection , and transfer of chosen gene insertions and deletions , and tagging methods fo

1.1. How Do Salmonella Attack Tumors Selectively?
There are several ways in which Salmonella could attack tumors , each of which may require modified protocols . 
Among these are the following : 
1 . 
As a pathogen , Salmonella bacteria could stimulate local non-specific immune responses by preferentially accumulating at tumor sites ( 40 -- 42 ) . 
2 . 
Salmonella could interfere with the growth of tumor cells or compete with tumor cells for nutrients ( 43 ) , thus impeding further tumor cell division and spread 
Abbreviations not explained in the above papers are listed in Note 8 . 
3 . 
Lysis of bacteria attached to tumor cells might release locally acting anti-tumor cellular components . 
4 . 
Engineered Salmonella could be used as carriers for introducing genetic vectors that express anti-tumor components . 
5 . 
Tumor peptides released as a result of Salmonella-induced necrosis could also be used to stimulate production of anti-tumor antibodies . 
6 . 
Rapid growth of Salmonella in necrotic and hypoxic regions may allow Salmonella to multiply selectively in tumors . 
7 . 
Tumor-targeting Salmonella might be used to specifically express peptides at tumor sites . 
The peptides might have innate anti-tumor functions or be targets for other therapeutic chemicals . 
8 . 
Salmonella may be engineered to metabolize inactive pro-drugs into their active anti-tumor molecular structures at the tumor site , thus reducing toxic side effects to non-tumor cells . 
1.2 . 
Factors in the Design of Anti-Tumor Strain ( s ) of Salmonella Saltzman ( 3 ) has emphasized that the first concern to be addressed is to choose Salmonella strains that would optimize success in each step of the journey of Salmonella cells to their tumor destinations and ultimate destruction or blockage of tumor growth , without subsequent adverse consequences of toxicity due to bacteria . 
As a result , strain selection for anti-tumor effects has focused mainly on the avoidance of subsequent adverse consequences through tedious removal of virulence genes . 
In this strategy , care must be taken to prevent loss of essential genetic elements required for therapeutic effectiveness . 
Thus , it is important to retain gene products that maximize tumor destruction . 
1.3 . 
Questions to be Addressed in Salmonella Strain Development As pointed out in reviews of Salmonella anti-tumor effects ( 3,44 -- 50 ) , numerous new technical questions must be addressed in reaching successful use of Salmonella in cancer therapy . 
These include the following : 
1 . 
The chosen Salmonella strain ( s ) should have special clinical attributes . 
What are the genomic changes to be considered to develop superior strains ? 
2 . 
Which experimental cancer cell model ( s ) should be selected in testing superior strains ? 
What tumor cell lines should be used for preclinical tests ? 
3 . 
What molecular biology techniques would be recruited to genetically engineer superior Salmonella strains ? 
4 . 
What scoring method would be used to identify superior strains ( s ) ? 
5 . 
How do candidate strains differ in attachment to surfaces , invasion , attraction to specific organelles , chromosomal destruction , etc. . 
6 . 
How can Salmonella cells be tracked in the course of experiments ( e.g. , fluorescent dyes , stains , etc. ) ( see Table 2 ) ( 50 ) . 
7 . 
Can two different Salmonella cell lines be differentially marked in competition experiments ? 
8 . 
Is Salmonella penetration necessary for anti-tumor effects , or does effectiveness merely result from surface contact ? 
9 . 
If the anti-tumor effect mandates Salmonella penetration , does it also require bacterial metabolic activity ? 
Multiplication ? 
10 . 
Because the key to the ultimate goal is non-toxicity , what preclinical LD50 protocol should be used ? 
11 . 
While mouse tests are standard for LD50 determinations , are there other model systems that could be used for toxicity testing ? 
These model organisms could be useful at later stages when assaying mechanisms of tumor cell line targeting and destruction . 
12 . 
What method should be used to introduce Salmonella into the patient ? 
Oral would be ideal for ease of administration , as Salmonella typhimurium finds its own route through organs to the tumor cells . 
Arguments against oral introduction would include poor control of inoculum concentration due to competition versus resident microflora and requirement to keep virulence genes required for invasion of the intestinal epithelium . 
13 . 
For effective therapy , should Salmonella infection be accompanied with other therapeutic measures ? 
If so , which ? 
What other anti-cancer treatments should be combined with Salmonella to optimize therapeutic effectiveness ? 
14 . 
What assays should be used to determine success in clinical studies ( 48,51 -- 55 ) ? 
1.4. Use of Salmonella for Prostate Tumor Detection
Although the objective of Salmonella targeting of tumor cells is to eradicate solid tumors , it might also have a quasi-preventive role . 
For example , the majority of older men test positive for prostate-specific antibody ( PSA ) , an indication that prostate tumors may ( but not necessarily ) be present . 
However , conventional therapy upon observation of a high PSA titer is often postponed until significant increase in PSA levels is seen , because a high PSA does not always indicate an active tumor . 
This `` watchful waiting '' procedure could be enhanced by Salmonella administration and subsequent clinical testing for reduction in PSA levels . 
1.5. Use of Single Strain Versus Multiple Strains
There may be an advantage to using a `` cocktail '' of two or more Salmonella strains . 
Genes for amplifying the tumor-killing phenotype of Salmonella could be put on a plasmid vector containing a stable cellular poison carried by

`` helper '' Salmonella that expresses an unstable `` antidote '' protease from the chromosome , thereby reducing the chances of creating a more virulent strain in the host via transformation and/or recombination . 
Other variants of this strategy may be viable ; however , care must be taken to ensure that both strains compete successfully for association and persistence at the target tumor site . 
1.6. Choice of Salmonella Strain[s] for Cancer Therapy
Strategies for Salmonella anti-tumor effects were pioneered starting in 1978 ( 39,56 -- 66 ) . 
However , current experiments with this strategy received increased consideration with the use of strain VNP20009 ( 46,48,67 -- 71 ) . 
Several laboratories have used this strain either with or without genetic modifications , as may be seen in Table 1 . 
VNP20009 was derived from ATCC14028 . 
ATCC14028 , listed as Salmonella enterica subspecies Enterica , was deposited as `` Salmonella typhimurium , Castellani and Chambers . 
Isolation : tissue , animal ( pools of heart and liver from 4-week-old chickens ) . '' 
It has been circulated and used by many investigators in virulence and immunology studies and is often called just 14028 . 
The anti-tumor strategy with VNP20009 sparked our interest . 
We decided to compare the effectiveness of VNP20009 ( ATCC14028 origin ) with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 , a strain of independent origin . 
We were curious whether the LT2 strain isolated about 60 years ago would also show affinity for tumor cells . 
LT2 was isolated by Lilleengen [ Lilleengen Type ( LT ) ] , sen to Joshua Lederberg for P22 transduction studies in 1953 , and shortly after sent to Miloslav Demerec for extensive genetic mapping and biochemical studies . 
It was the first Salmonella to be completely sequenced ( 72 ) and is deposited at ATCC as 70072 . 
The LT2 sequence is the standard for microarray comparison of genomic changes in related strains ( 14 ) . 
LT2 genetics have been extensively analyzed and thousands of mutant LT2 strains are officially curated by K. E. Sanderson at the Salmonella Genetic Stock Center ( SGSC ) ( http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/∼kesander/ ) . 
Although the methods described in Subheadings 1.7 . 
-- 1.9 . 
center on our current usage of strain CRC1674 in the laboratory , the methods are applicable to investigations used in the past , as well as those that might be planned for the future . 
Our laboratory has several thousand replicas of these mutant strains from the original Demerec collection . 
Between the years 1997 and 2007 , we have examined the diversity among LT2 strains that had been archived in agar stabs for over four decades ( 73 -- 75 ) and are a half-century beyond its parental initial murine infection and isolation . 
Initially , we compared archival LT2 strains with VNP20009 with regard to interaction with breast cancer cells . 
One of our strains ( CRC1674 ) destroyed breast cancer cells differently from VNP20009 ; thus , we have chosen this as our candidate strain . 
Its genotype is listed in Table 1 . 
It stems from a pathogenic progenitor isolated in 1947 . 
It has numerous genomic alterations as determined by microarray analysis ( 14 ) and other scoring methods . 
Among these are his-2550 ( plus suppressor mutation , DIIR49B ) ( 76 ) . 
It has an altered rpoS start signal of UUG instead of AUG as well as a G to T mutation in position 168 in the rpoS sequence , which may account for decreased quantity of HPI and HPII hydroperoxidases regulated by rpoS . 
When analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) , it had the longest genome among 13 archived strains , with an extra band of 180 kb ( 77 ) . 
To further reduce the possibility of toxic shock , we have engineered additional genetic changes with the goal of developing an effective therapeutic strain . 
We have transduced strains now under investigation with aroC to reduce toxicity and deleted thyA ( thymidylate synthetase ) ( 78 ) to make it deficient in nucleotide synthesis . 
By selection of a `` rough '' phenotype that eliminates or reduces the amount of surface O-antigen , toxic shock events should be further reduced . 
We avoided the use of nitrosoguanidine to introduce auxotrophy , which could result in additional , but unknown secondary mutations . 
Because we are interested in determining the mechanisms of targeted attachment and invasion , we are also testing a strain with a shortened genome containing many random deletions . 
Construction of a therapeutic strain usin this organism would be an additional strategy ( i.e. , adding desired genes ) versus the subtraction strategy in current use ( i.e. , deleting undesired genes ) . 
It is also recognized that there are many biological and immunological unknowns that take place in Salmonella invasion . 
It is exciting to greet the results of new experiments that lead to our understanding of the mechanisms behind Salmonella therapeutics . 
This method chapter is focused on genomic engineering of strains with various desired characteristics and their interaction with tumor cell lines .

Proﬁling S. typhimurium LT2 Expression When Co-Incubated with Cancer Cells ; Isolating Tn5 Knockouts that No Longer Associate with Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Most of the Salmonella strains developed for therapeutic study to date have originated with the ATCC14028 strain of S. typhimurium . 
We have genetically profiled both the LT2-derived CRC1674 and the ATCC14028-derived VNP20009 candidate strains by generating fluorescently labeled PCR products of > 96 % known open reading frames ( ORFs ) and measuring DNA -- DNA hybridization on microarrays in collaboration with Michael McClelland at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center ( San Diego , CA ) to determine the genetic differences between the two strains [ ( 14 ) , unpublished data ] . 
We have determined that CRC1674 lacks nine genes found in the LT2 sequence and may have substantial changes ( loss of highly similar sequences to promote DNA -- DNA hybridization on microarrays ) in 182 genes ( 4.4 % of the genome ) compared with the sequenced LT2 strain . 
In comparison with VNP20009 , the CRC1674 strain possesses 61 genes that VNP20009 lacks , and 92 genes shared between CRC1674 and VNP20009 have substantial changes ( unpublished data ) . 
The method used to determine the genomic profile of Salmonella is described in Chapter 6 ( Porwollik and McClelland , this volume ) . 
Although these mutations may be important factors for CRC1674 's therapeutic activity on prostate cancer cells , these changes occurred during CRC1674 's > 50-year existence under starvation conditions in a stab vial and not co-existing with prostate cancer cell lines . 
Additionally , we do not know which genes in this list are expressed during co-incubation , invasion , and persistence within prostate cancer cells . 
In addition to making selected gene disruptions to reduce Salmonella toxicity , we have focused our efforts on two projects : ( 1 ) profiling of CRC1674 messenger RNA expression during initial stages of attachment and invasion of PC-3M prostate cancer cells and ( 2 ) identifying random Tn5 knockout mutants that can no longer associate with the PC-3M prostate cancer cell line but are normally expressed by CRC167 during co-incubation with PC-3M . 
Genes that are specifically expressed during co-incubation with PC-3M but prevent attachment when disrupted with a Tn5 insertion are being studied to determine their mechanistic role in Salmonella -- prostate cancer cell interactions ; however , all genes shown to have a role during attachment and invasion are of use when designing therapeutic Salmonella strains . 
1.8. mRNA Expression Proﬁles of CRC1674 to Identify Genes Speciﬁcally Expressed During Co-Incubation with Prostate Cancer
Cell Line PC-3M Important information can be gained by the initial profiling of mRNA expression levels in Salmonella that have been observed to invade and kill the PC-3M prostate cancer cell line . 
To do this , overnight cultures of CRC1674 are grown in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth and resuspended in Dulbecco 's phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) ( Gibco ) . 
A final concentration of approximately 1 × 106 bacteria/mL is added to cancer cells ( in this case , PC-3M prostate cancer cells ) . 
Control experiments include incubation of CRC1674 in the same media without cancer cells or in the presence of a non-cancerous cell line . 
Association of CRC1674 with the PC-3M line is typically seen within 1 h after inoculation ( unpublished observation ) . 
At regular time points starting after 90 min of incubation in cell culture , cells and bacteria are removed from a cell culture vessel using Trypsin -- EDTA and whole RNA isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit based on the guanidinium thiocyanate RNA extraction protocol reported by Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 79 ) . 
RNA isolated is treated with DNAse I to remove any residual genomic DNA . 
After inactivation of the DNAse I , the RNA is converted to a cDNA library by random priming with Ominscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase ( Qiagen ) using universal primers ( 80 ) . 
To specifically isolate mRNA transcripts of Salmonella DNA and lower the Salmonella rRNA signal , we used the selective capture of transcribed sequences ( SCOTS ) technique described by Graham and Clark-Curtiss ( 81 ) . 
CRC1674 genomic DNA is prepared via sonication and photobiotinylated . 
PCR-amplified Salmonella rrnA sequence is mixed with the biotinylated genomic DNA and the cDNA transcripts isolated . 
After denaturation at 98 C , the biotinylated Salmonella genomic DNA is specifically hybridized with Salmonella cDNA isolated from Salmonella mRNA transcripts . 
These genomic-cDNA hybrids are captured by the addition of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and separated from the prostate cancer cell line cDNA transcripts . 
Excess Salmonella ribosomal RNA is captured by the excess of non-biotinylated rrn 
DNA . 
The cDNA can then be selectively eluted from the beads and amplified using fluorescently-tagged primers complimentary to the conserved regions of the universal primers and applied to a non-redundant microarray that currently covers 99 % of all genes in the genomes of Salmonella serovars Typhimurium LT2 , Typhimurium SL1344 , Typhi CT18 , Typhi Ty2 , Paratyphi A SARB42 , and Enteritidis PT4 . 
In our laboratory , the microarray and subsequent mRNA analysis is done in collaboration with Michael McClelland at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in San Diego , CA , or at the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility . 
Microarray analyses are now standard in large research core facilities . 
These microarray data are analyzed for mRNA expression of CRC1674 Salmonella genes required during translocation to and attachment and invasion of PC-3M prostate cancer cells . 
Expression profiles of CRC1674 without prostate cancer cells allow screening out the expression of housekeeping genes and changes stimulated by translocation of the cells to new media . 
If necessary , cells can be grown in the PC-3M culture media to mid-log to remove expression profiles caused by the change in media types . 
This procedure can identify specific mRNA expression of genes involved in such phenotypes as chemotaxis , fimbrial biosynthesis , and formation of the `` invasome '' organelle structures with type III secretion systems and effectors ( e.g. , the inv , spa , or hil loci ) shown to be involved in the attachment and invasion of the intestinal epithelium . 
Observation of some expected transcripts helps to assure that the mRNA extraction and amplification SCOTS procedure is working correctly . 
These data are of value when engineering superior therapeutic Salmonella strains ; any characterized virulence genes not expressed during co-incubation with cancer cells are candidates for elimination to reduce the toxicity of therapeutic strain . 
1.9 . 
Creation and Isolation of Salmonella CRC1674 Tn5 Knockout Pool ( s ) That No Longer Associates with Prostate Tumor Cells . 
Sequence Genes Flanking Tn5 Transposon Insertions that Prevent Association with PC-3M Cancer Cells To further compliment and focus on studies of genes specifically responsible for initial association and invasion of PC-3M prostate cancer cells by Salmonella , we have generated a random Tn5 <KAN-2> knockout pool in our CRC1674 strain to isolate genes that can no longer associate with PC-3M prostate cancer cells . 
A Tn5 <KAN-2> random knockout pool was made in Michael McClelland 's laboratory using Epicentre 's EZ-Tn5 ™ Transposome kit and generated 39,000 kanamycin-resistant mutants in the Salmonella strai 
14028s background , approximately 10 independent knockout insertions in every gene of the 14028s Salmonella genome . 
We propagated bacteriophage P22 HT/int on 2 % of the 14028s Tn5 pool and transduced the random Tn5 inserts into our CRC1674 strain , generating approximately 96,000 colonies to create a Tn5 knockout library in our therapeutic strain which we stored in 25 % glycerol at − 80 C . 
If a Tn5 disruption pool created by transduction and assayed using the transposon footprinting method suggests that this Tn5 pool is limited , we suggest generating a random Tn5 <KAN-2> pool directly in your candidate strain using the Epicentre EZ-Tn5 ™ Transposome kit ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Generation of a CRC1674 Tn5 disruption mutant sub-pool that can not associate with PC-3M prostate cancer cells is performed by outgrowth of the CRC1674 Tn5 pool above to mid-log phase to allow recovery from − 80 C frozen stocks . 
Approximately , 1 × 106 − 7 cfu/mL of Salmonella washed in 1 × PBS are mixed with PC-3M prostate cancer cells . 
Beginning at time points after 60 min of co-incubation , Salmonella in the culture supernatant are drawn off , spun down , and grown in LB broth containing 50 g/mL kanamycin overnight for storage and analysis of the sub-pools using the `` transposon footprinting '' technique ( 82 ) . 
Briefly , transposon footprinting is an assay that identifies specific Tn5 disruption mutants by creating a unique PCR amplification profile that depends on the site of Tn5 insertion and distance from NlaIII restriction sites ( 5 ′ - CATG ∧ -3 ′ ) . 
PCR products are produced by attaching linkers onto NlaIII-digested genomic DNA and amplifying product using primers complimentary to the Tn5 sequence and a unique sequence in the attached linker . 
To select genes that are absolutely required for association with PC-3M cells ( and eliminate false positives ) , the sub-pool can be grown and the coincubation procedure repeated until no reduction of the Tn5-mutant population is observed using the transposon footprinting assay . 
The genes disrupted by Tn5 transposon insertion are identified by sequencing of the transposon footprinting PCR products and evaluated for potential attenuation of downstream gene transcription . 
In addition to finding genes with no assigned function , one can expect to find genes required for association of Salmonella with the intestinal epithelium and other cultured cells , including genes involved in chemotaxis , construction of fimbriae , secretion systems designed to release molecules that promote Salmonella phagocytosis , and transcriptional regulators that control these systems . 
Isolation of genes already characterized as important for association with other cell types will assist in further optimization of therapeutic strains ; if genetic systems needed for association to other cell lines are not isolate in the pool , they become candidate genes that can be removed to increase the specificity and limit the toxicity of the therapeutic strain . 
Genes found in this strain that are specifically expressed during incubation with PC-3M cells are excellent candidates for further study

Lambda Red gene replacement . 
This cartoon figure depicts the replacement of `` your target gene '' ( ytg ) with a Kanamycin resistance cassette . 
After identification and sequencing of the gene to be replaced , primers are designed that have 5 ′ ends with 35 -- 50 bp homologous to the start ( ytg ' ) and end ( ` ytg ) of the ytg coding sequence . 
The 3 ′ primer ends are homologous to sequence up and downstream of a selection cassette flanked by frt sites ( in this figure , a Kanamycin resistance cassette ) . 
The selection cassette is amplified with the primers using PCR and the resulting linear product transformed into an organism that contains the targeted gene . 
Expression of the Red locus ( Bet , Exo , and Gam ) from a vector promotes recombination between the homologous ytg regions , resulting in deletion of the target gene . 
The resistance cassette can be removed by the addition of a vector that expresses Flp , a site-specific recombinase that will bind to and recombine DNA between the frt sites , looping out the resistance cassette . 
1.10 . 
Genetic and Cytological Characterization of Genes Required for Salmonella-Associated Prostate Cancer 
Cell Death Once specific Salmonella genes are identified to be essential for targeting , attachment , invasion , inhibition , and/or death of tumor cells , there are many experimental options that can be explored . 
Characterization of the gene ( s ) selected for investigation should be used as a guide to further experimentation . 
Hypothetical functions assigned to uncharacterized genes in NCBI and other online databases suggest biochemical mechanisms used by these genes , and these assignments should be interpreted as guides for planning biochemical assays . 
To confirm the importance of genes identified by mRNA expression and Tn5 selection , precise disruptions or deletions are made in the genes and the mutated Salmonella candidates tested for their ability to target , attach , invade , and kill tumor cells in your model . 
If you do not have access to pre-existing mutants , they can be constructed using the Lambda Red gene replacement system ( often referred to as `` Red-Swapping '' ) pioneered by Datsenko and Wanner ( 83 ) . 
This protocol is graphically described in Fig. 1 , and a brief description of the protocol follows below .

3. Methods 3.1. Lambda Red Gene Replacement Protocol for Targeted
Gene Disruptions 1 . 
Obtain plasmids pKD46 ( 42 C temperature-sensitive , AmpR plasmid that expresses the Lambda Red gene locus when induced by l-arabinose ) and pCP20 ( 42 C temperature-sensitive plasmid that constitutively expresses Flp ) . 
2 . 
Obtain plasmids pKD3 and pKD4 or other DNA that contains a selective gene flanked by frt sites for later removal of the selective gene . 
3 . 
Transform pKD46 into your transformation-competent candidate Salmonella strain and grow at 30 C on LB + 50 g/mL Amp to insure stability of the pKD46 plasmid . 
Archive a transformed colony for making later gene replacements in the strain ( see Note 3 ) . 
4 . 
Design your PCR primers as described in Subheading 2.1 . 
( item 5 ) . 
Fig. 1 shows this graphically . 
Be sure to BLAST the primer sequences against the complete genome sequence ( if available ) to determine if there is substantial homology to alternative sites . 
If this exists , engineer the 35 -- 50 bp homologous region slightly upstream or downstream until the similarity disappears . 
5 . 
Perform PCR with your primers and the DNA template that has a selection or resistance gene flanked by FRT sites . 
We use pKD3 ( CamR ) or pKD4 ( KanR ) as templates . 
6 . 
Perform electrophoresis on the PCR reaction on agarose gels to confirm the presence of a PCR product of the predicted size . 
We typically run 5 L of a 20 -- 100 L PCR reaction . 
If there are secondary products , purify the desired PCR product from the agarose gel . 
If there are no secondary products , we remove the salts from the finished PCR reaction using Qiagen Qiaquick PCR purification columns . 
Resuspend the DNA in deionized , sterilized H2O . 
7 . 
Start an overnight culture of your candidate strain + pKD46 in 2 mL LB + 50 g/mL Amp at 30 C. Incubate at least 8 h. 8 . 
Subculture the overnight culture into a fresh LB + 50 g/mL Amp + 50 mM l-arabinose at a 1:100 dilution . 
Prepare heat shock or electrocompetent cells from this culture . 
9 . 
Transform the PCR product ( typically 2 L ) into 20 -- 50 L of competent cells . 
We prepare electrocompetent cells and transform the DNA : cells in a 1-mm gap width electroporation cuvette on an Electroporator 2510 ( Eppendorf ) set to 1800 mV . 
10 . 
Immediately resuspend the transformed cells in 500 L of LB broth and incubate at 30 C for 1 h to allow for recovery and expression of the selective gene 
3 . 
Tannic Acid , EM grade ( Polysciences ) . 
4 . 
Osmium tetroxide ( OsO4 ) . 
11 . 
Spin down the cells and resuspend in 100 L of LB broth . 
Plate the cells onto selective media ( with the appropriate antibiotic ) . 
Incubate selection plates overnight at 37 C. Use colony PCR or DNA sequencing to confirm the location of the putative gene disruption . 
12 . 
Resuspend a colony with a successful gene disruption in a 500 - L Eppendorf tube containing 100 L LB . 
Incubate the tube at 42 C for 8 h to dilute the pKD46 plasmid . 
Use a sterile stick or loop and streak the culture for isolation . 
Incubate at 37 C. Patch 10 -- 50 isolated colonies to LB + 50 g/mL Amp plates and LB plates to confirm the loss of pKD46 . 
13 . 
If removal of the selective gene is desired , transform the Flp-expressing pCP20 plasmid into your strain , using AmpR or CamR media for plasmid retention . 
Transformants can be patched onto LB plates and LB plates containing your original selective pressure to screen for loss of the selective gene . 
The pCP20 plasmid can then be lost using the procedure described in this step ( step 13 ) . 
The above protocol is a modification of an excellently written Lambda Red Gene Replacement `` Red-Swap '' protocol available in pdf format at Professor Stanley Maloy 's laboratory website ( URL : http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/ ∼ smaloy/Research/protocols . 
htm ) . 
It is important to note that inducible promoters and other genetic elements can be swapped into the chromosome upstream of the gene ( s ) of interest to conduct experiments ( e.g. , looking at the effects of overexpression or for purification of gene products ) . 
You are not limited to gene disruption using this technique . 
Construction of disruption and inducible overexpression mutations in your genes of interest can be co-incubated with your cancer model to confirm that the gene ( s ) are essential for therapeutic effect . 
These strains can be grown ( and induced if examining the effect of overexpression ) and co-incubated with prostate cancer cell lines on glass cover slips . 
Samples are fixed ( and stained if desired ) at set time points and examined using confocal , fluorescent , or electron microscopy . 
Analysis is aided by the use of morphological Live/Dead stains with confocal microscopy , fluorescent-tagged antibodies specific to Salmonella , or cancer cell receptors or sectioning of cancer cells to confirm invasion phenotypes of Salmonella using electron microscopy ( see Fig. 2b , c ) . 
Microscopy can also be used in competition experiments between different candidate strains to determine which candidate has the superior therapeutic phenotype ( or ensuring that both strains can colonize a tumor target if using a multiple-strain therapy ) . 
We use plasmids that constitutively express fluorescent proteins with different emission spectra to discern between different therapeutic strains in these competition assays ( see Table 2 ) . 
Many fluorescent proteins are commercially ( e.g. , BD Biosciences Clontech , Invitrogen ) or non-commercially ( Roger Y. Tsien 's laboratory at UCSD has a wide selection of plasmids that express fluorescen proteins ) available ( 50 ) . 
Strains that have clear competitive advantages can be quickly incorporated into efficacy and safety testing while continuing investigation of the mechanism ( s ) behind the genetic changes . 
After confirming that Salmonella requires a particular gene or genes for anti-tumor therapy , different experiments can be designed to analyze the mechanism ( s ) for achieving the therapeutic effect . 
Besides analysis and annotation of the genetic sequence `` in silico , '' biochemical purification and localization of the gene products using antibodies can be a good place to start analysis of what biochemical function ( s ) the gene products perform and where they are localized in the cell . 
These are general suggestions and further experiments can be designed depending on which function ( s ) the researcher thinks the gene products are performing during targeting , invasion , and/or killing of the tumor cells .
