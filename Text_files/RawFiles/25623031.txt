Article history : 
Mannose-binding lectin ( MBL ) is a C-type serum lectin of importance in innate immunity . 
Low serum concentrations of MBL have been associated with greater susceptibility to infections . 
In this study , binding of puriﬁed chicken MBL ( cMBL ) to Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica ( S. enterica ) serotypes B , C1 and D was investigated by ﬂow cytometry , and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) was used for comparison . 
For S. enterica the C1 serotypes were the only group to exhibit binding to cMBL . 
Furthermore , functional studies of the role of cMBL in phagocytosis and complement activation were performed . 
Spiking with cMBL had a dose-dependent effect on the HD11 phagocytic activity of S. enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Montevideo , and a more pronounced effect in a carbohydrate competitive assay . 
This cMBL dose dependency of opsonophagocytic activity by HD11 cells was not observed for S. aureus . 
No difference in complement-dependent bactericidal activity in serum with high or low cMBL concentrations was found for S. Montevideo . 
On the other hand , serum with high concentrations of cMBL exhibited a greater bactericidal activity to S. aureus than serum with low concentrations of cMBL . 
The results presented here emphasise that chicken cMBL exhibits functional similarities with its mammalian counterparts , i.e. playing a role in opsonophagocytosis and complement activation .

Introduction
line of defence against invasion of viral , parasitic and bacterial pathogens . 
MBL is a serum protein and is primarily produced by hepatocytes ( Holmskov et al. , 2003 ) . 
MBL is able to bind to speciﬁc sugar patterns , i.e. mannose-rich carbohydrates present on microbial cell surfaces , using its carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD ) and thereby acting as a humoral pattern-recognition receptor .

First , human MBL can enhance opsonophagocytosis by leukocytes ( reviewed by Garred et al. , 2009 ) . 
This also includes enhancement of opsonophagocytosis of necrotic and apoptotic cells after binding to their altered endogenous ligands ( Nauta et al. , 2003 ; Ogden et al. , 2001 ) . 
Second , human MBL can activate the complement system via the lectin-dependent pathway . 
MBL interacts with the mannose-binding associated proteases ( MASPs ) in order to induce the complement cascade reactions . 
In humans , MASP-1 promotes transactivation of MASP-2 ( Heja et al. , 2012 ) , but MBL-MASP-2 complexes have also been shown to activate the complement cascade in the absence of MASP-1 ( Ip et al. , 2009 ; Vorup-Jensen et al. , 2000 ) . 
Third , the human MBL/MASP complex has been shown to inﬂuence the coagulation pathway , indicating a role for MBL in cell homeostasis and coagulation as well ( La Bonte et al. , 2012 ) . 
In humans , MBL deﬁciency has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections ( reviewed by Takahashi , 2011 ; Heitzeneder et al. , 2012 ) . 
MBL has been isolated and characterised from several species , among these humans ( Kawasaki et al. , 1983 ) , mice ( Sastry et al. , 1995 ) , cattle ( Loveless et al. , 1989 ) , pigs ( Agah et al. , 2001 ) , ﬁsh ( Nikolakopoulou and Zarkadis , 2006 ) and chickens ( Laursen et al. .

1995 ) . 
In correspondence with the human studies , low concentrations of MBL also impact disease severity in chickens . 
For investigation the effect of MBL on disease severity in chickens , outbred chicken lines have been used to investigate the inﬂuence of MBL concentrations during a Pasteurella ( P. ) multocida infection , and a correlation between low concentrations of MBL and systemic P. multocida infection was shown ( Schou et al. , 2010a ) . 
Furthermore , the inbred chicken line L10 has been used as an in vivo model ( Juul-Madsen et al. , 2007 ) in which an MBL effect was shown in relation to infections with infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) ( JuulMadsen et al. , 2007 ; Kjaerup et al. , 2014 ) , Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) ( Norup et al. , 2009 ) , and more recently Salmonella subsp . 
enterica serovar Infantis ( Ulrich-Lynge et al. , 2014 ) . 
described in chickens ( Lynch et al. , 2005 ) . 
The order for cMBL binding of monosaccharides is ManNAc > l-fucose > mannose > GlcNAc ( Laursen et al. , 1995 ) , while for human MBL it is GlcNAc > l-fucose , mannose , mannosamine ( ManNAc ) > maltose > glucose '' N-acetyl galactosamine ( GalNAc ) ( Holmskov et al. , 1994 ) . 
In chickens two MASPs and one MAp have been cloned and characterised , MASP-2 , -3 and MAp19 ( Lynch et al. , 2005 ) . 
A chicken MASP-1 equivalent to human MASP-1 has been identiﬁed , but because of the lack of an exon in the chicken MASP-1 gene it is not functional ( Lynch et al. , 2005 ) . 
Despite the apparent absence of MASP-1 in chickens , cMBL appears to be able to drive the activation of the complement cascade ; this has been demonstrated in a heterologous system by deposition of human C4b on the chicken MBL-MASP complex ( JuulMadsen et al. , 2003 ; Norup and Juul-Madsen , 2007 ) . 
imately 6 g/ml based on 14 different chicken lines representing both broilers and layers , and the cMBL concentration in serum ranges from less than 1 to 35 g/ml or more due to genetic variations ( Laursen et al. , 1995 ) . 
Two-three fold upregulation of cMBL has been observed during the acute stages of infection , making it a minor acute phase protein in the chicken ( Juul-Madsen et al. , 2007 ; Laursen and Nielsen , 2000 ; Nielsen et al. , 1999 ) . 
may cause human food borne salmonellosis , gastro-enteritis and in severe cases death of the patient . 
It can be subdivided into different serogroups based on repeat units of the lipopolysaccharide chain ( designated O-antigen ) ( CDC , 2013 ; Rycroft , 2000 ) . 
The most commonly known and investigated serogroups with zoonotic activity are serogroup B which include S. subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium and serogroup D which includes S. subsp . 
enterica serovar Enteritidis . 
However , poultry infections caused by serotypes from the C1 serogroup including S. Infantis and S. subsp . 
enterica serovar Montevideo have been emerging during the last decade ( EFSA , 2012 ; Hauser et al. , 2012 ) . 
Furthermore , host-speciﬁc serotypes such as S. subsp . 
enterica serovar Gallinarum and S. subsp . 
enterica serovar Pullorum , both from serogroup B , are of importance as they may cause typhoid-like symptoms sometimes leading to death in poultry ( Calenge et al. , 2010 ) . 
A number of in vitro studies have been made in relation to human MBL and its interaction with Salmonella strains . 
These studies show that human MBL binds to several serotypes of S. enterica especially to the C1 serogroup , the studies have especially focused on S. Montevideo , which contains multiple mannose-residues on its O-antigen ( Valtonen , 1977 ; Schweinle et al. , 1989 ; Devyatyarova-Johnson et al. , 2000 ) . 
Differences in the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) have been shown to inﬂuence the susceptibility toward S. Enteritidis ( Schou et al. , 2010b ) However , it remains unclear if cMBL is able to bind to and/or inﬂuence immune responses to any of the more than 2500 serotypes of S. enterica .

enterica ( S. enterica ) The main objective of this study was to investigate the binding 
( S. aureus ) , and to elucidate the functional properties of cMBL in relation to opsonophagocytosis and complement activation by in vitro studies . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
A list over the bacterial strains used in this study is shown in Table 1 . 
A range of WT S. enterica strains were kindly donated by John Elmerdahl Olsen , Copenhagen University , Denmark . 
Furthermore , the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ( HPA Culture Collections , Public Health England , UK , cat . 
no . 
NCTC 06571 ) was used for comparison in the experiments throughout the study as it has been conﬁrmed to bind strongly to human MBL ( Neth et al. , 2000 ) . 
Growth and preparation of bacteria
S. enterica strains and S. aureus were removed from frozen storage at − 80 ◦ C and streaked/cultured ◦ at 37 C on LB agar for 16 to 18 h ( Sigma-Aldrich Co. . 
LLC. , Brøndby , cat . 
no . 
L2897 ) . 
A single colony of each bacterial strain was thereafter cultured in LB broth ( Sigma-Aldrich Co. . 
LLC. , Brøndby , cat . 
no . 
L3022 ) at 37 ◦ C for 18 h , until OD600nm = 1 . 
The colony forming units ( CFU ) / ml of bacteria solution were further validated by plating dilutions on LB agar , followed by incubation at ◦ 37 C for 18 h. 
Puriﬁcation of chicken MBL
For the phagocytic assay , puriﬁed cMBL in TBS ( 10 mM tris , 147 mM NaCl pH 7.4 ) was used . 
It was purchased from the Department of Cancer and Inﬂammation Research , Institute of Molecular Medicine , University of Southern Denmark , Odense . 
It was puriﬁed as previously described ( Laursen et al. , 1998 ) . 
Measurement of serum MBL concentrations
For the phagocytic assay and the bactericidal assay , serum from the chicken line L10 was used . 
Selective breeding of chickens for low or high serum MBL concentrations has been performed for several generations at our department as published by Juul-Madsen et al. ( 2007 ) , and the two sublines have been designated , ( L10L ) for low or ( L10H ) for high concentrations of serum MBL . 
The ELISA for measuring the concentration of cMBL was performed as previously described ( Juul-Madsen et al. , 2007 ; Juul-Madsen et al. , 2003 ) . 
Part 1—cMBL binding to S. enterica and S. aureus
Conjugation of ﬂuorochrome to anti-MBL antibody
The anti-MBL antibody ( Statens Serum Institut , Copenhagen , Denmark , mouse monoclonal anti-MBL antibody cat .

LNK034APC ) . 
The conjugated antibody was stored at 4 ◦ C until use . 
Detection of cMBL binding to S. enterica and S. aureus The binding of MBL to 14 S. enterica strains from serotypes C1 , B and D ( Table 1 ) and S. aureus ( NCTC 06571 ) was determined by a ﬂow cytometric procedure , adapted from Devyatyarova-Johnson et al. ( 2000 ) . 
First , 50 l aliquots of the bacterial suspensions containing approximately 1 8 × 10 CFU/ml were centrifuged at 9600 × g for 1 min , and washed with 500 l veronal buffered saline ( VBS ) ( supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 , ( Lonza , Walkersville , USA , cat . 
no. 12-624E ) ) ( VBS2 + ) . 
The pellet was resuspende in VBS2 + buffer containing either 10 g/ml puriﬁed cMBL or no cMBL . 
The suspensions were incubated at ◦ centrifuged . 
The bacterial cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 100 2 + was then incubated in the dark at ◦ trifugation and washing of the bacterial cell pellet . 
Samples were resuspended in 200 l of 2 + the addition of 200 l 2 % ( wt/vol ) paraformaldehyde in PBS . 
The samples were kept at ◦ cytometer . 
SCanto ( Beckton Dickinson ) equipped with a 488 nm blue laser and a 633 nm red laser . 
Light transmission data from the APC-illuminated MBL-bacteria complexes were collected by a forward scatter ( FSC ) detector , side scatter ( SSC ) detector , and the APC ﬂu-orescence detector . 
MBL binding was expressed as APC median ﬂuorescence intensity ( MFI ) and categorised as positive cMBL binding if the signal was above the negative control prepared with bacteria without cMBL , stained with APC-anti-cMBL antibody . 
S. Montevideo ( S. 123489 ) , S. Thompson ( NSC39 ) , S. Virchow ( dk0 ) ) and S. aureus ( NTCT 06571 ) were further used to investigate : ( 1 ) Binding dose dependency . 
This was done by spiking with 2.5 , 5.0 , 10.0 and 20.0 g/ml of puriﬁed cMBL . 
( 2 ) cMBL binding speciﬁcity mediated by the CRD domain . 
This was done by incubating 10 g/ml MBL with a known antagonist ( 25 mM N-Acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) ) , a puriﬁed chelating agent ( 10 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ) or a non-antagonist ( 25 mM galactose ) 10 min prior to addition of the bacteria . 
MBL binding was expressed as APC median ﬂuorescence intensity ( MFI ) as in the latter experiment .

The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS and washed once by centrifugation . 
The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml FITC , and then incubated in the dark at 150 revolutions per minute ( RPM ) for 60 min . 
To remove unconjugated FITC , the solution was washed with PBS using centrifugation at 9600 × g for 2 min . 
The wash was repeated at least 3 times . 
Finally , the FITC-HKB was resuspended in 1 ml PBS and kept in the dark at − 20 ◦ C until they were used in assays . 
To ensure proper FITC-labelling , all FITC-HKB were tested for labelling by FSC/SSC gating and FITC ﬂuorescence detection on the BD FACSCanto . 
Furthermore , FITC-labelled Zymosan A ( LifeTechnologies , cat .

HD11 cell preparation
The chicken macrophage-like cell line HD11 transformed by the avian leukaemia virus strain MC29 ( Beug et al. , 1979 ) was maintained in RPMI1640 containing 25 mM HEPES and 446 mg/l UltraGlutamine 1 ( Lonza , cat .

C5405 ) and antibiotics ( 100 g penicillin/ml and 100 g streptomycin/ml ) , at 41 ◦ C , 5 % CO2 , and 95 % humidity . 
The cells were trypsinised ( Lonza , cat . 
no . 
BE17-161F ) , harvested and washed with RPMI1640 . 
Aliquots of cell suspensions ( 2 6 × 10 cells/ml ) were seeded into wells at 500 l/well in a 24-well plate ( Becton Dickinson Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and cultured in RPMI1640 ( Lonza , cat . 
no . 
BE12-1115F / U1 ) supplemented with 10 % chicken serum and antibiotics . 
In order to have both an assay plate and a control plate two identical 24-well plates were made for each experiment . 
The cells were allowed to grow to about 85 % conﬂuency during an overnight incubation ( Harvath and Terle , 1999 ; Sokolovska et al. , 2012 ) . 
Phagocytic assay
As a representative of the C1 serotype S. Montevideo ( S. 123445 ) was chosen , as binding had been conﬁrmed and because S. Montevideo has been used as a C1 serotype model in human MBL studies ( Valtonen , 1977 ; Schweinle et al. , 1989 ; Devyatyarova-Johnson et al. , 2000 ) . 
The phagocytic assay consisted of two steps ; opsonisation and phagocytosis as described below .

Opsonised FITC-Zymosan A was washed twice in RPMI1640 and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min , to remove azide according to the manufacturers recommendations , before it was resuspended in RPMI1640 media containing the individually selected sera used during the opsonisation . 
Prior to phagocytosis , the culture medium was removed from the 24-well plate and the HD11 cells were washed once with fresh RPMI1640 ( Lonza , cat . 
no . 
BE12-1115F / U1 ) . 
Each phagocytic reaction was conducted using a ﬁnal volume of 500 l in a 12 well plate containing the HD11 cells . 
The samples were incubated at 41 ◦ C , in a 5 % CO2 humidi-ﬁed incubator for 3 h in the dark . 
The corresponding control plate was ◦ ment of the bacteria . 
Phagocytosis was terminated by placing all plates on ice . 
Hereafter , the media were removed , and 500 l of ice-cold 2 mM EDTA was added to each well , to gently wash off bacteria not adherent to the HD11 cells . 
To detach the cells another ice-cold 500 l 20 mM EDTA was added to each well , and vigorous pipetting was used . 
The cells were transferred on ice to Eppendorf tubes , and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min . 
After having removed the EDTA solution , the cells were resuspended in 250 l FACS buffer ( 0.2 % BSA , 0.2 % sodium azide , 0.05 % normal horse serum in PBS ) and kept at 4 ◦ C in polypropylene tubes until ﬂow cytometric analysis . 
All cells were analysed within 1 h of detachment from the plates . 
FACSCanto . 
A phagocytic score or integrated ( i ) MFI ( Darrah et al. , 2007 ) was determined based on MFI of FITC positive cells and calculated as follows : ( ( % FITC-bacteria positive ( 41 ◦ C ) − % FITC-bacteria background ( 4 ◦ C ) ) × MFI FITC-bacteria positive ( 41 ◦ C ) ) . 
To remove inter-assay differences , the ratio of phagocytic activity was calculated based on the highest iMFI from experiment to experiment within the phagocytised species , i.e. either S. Montevideo , S. aureus or Zymosan A. Three replicate experiments for all samples were performed , and in each experiment duplicates of every sample were Phagocytosis : following opsonisation , the opsonised FITC-S .

Phagocytic activity using Zymosan A as a cMBL antagonist To test the ability of puriﬁed cMBL to affect phagocytosis , the above assay was repeated with some changes . 
Instead of 10 % selected L10 chicken serum only 2 % was used , both for the opsonisation and phagocytosis . 
The serum was collected from one L10L chicken with a cMBL serum concentration of 6.9 g/ml . 
Phagocytosis of S. Montevideo ( S. 123489 ) and S. aureus were tested while spiking with puriﬁed cMBL in concentrations of 0 , 5 and 25 g/ml , respectively , during both opsonisation and phagocytosis . 
To prevent loss of MBL there was no washing step between the opsonisation and the phagocytosis . 
Otherwise the protocol was the same as in the above assay . 
A parallel study was conducted either with or without the addition of Zymosan A. Zymosan A was added as a competitor minimizing the amount of free MBL in the solution ( as well as other Zymosan A binding components in the samples ) . 
7 This was done by addition of approximately 4 × 10 / well unlabelled Zymosan A ( Bioporto , cat .

The iMFI parameter was used to present the data . 
Part 3—Bactericidal activity towards S. Montevideo and S. aureus
The effect of cMBL on complement-dependent bactericidal activity to S. Montevideo or S. aureus was determined using a protocol adapted from Capparelli et al. ( 2008 , 2009 ) . 
Sera were selected from L10 chickens with a mean MBL concentration of 26.2 ± 3 g/ml ( n = 9 ) for the high group ( L10H ) and 9.2 ± 1 g/ml ( n = 9 ) for the low group ( L10L ) . 
A mixture of S. Montevideo ( S. 123445 ) ( 104 CFU suspended in 100 l PBS ) or S. aureus ( NCTC 06571 ) ( 105 CFU suspended in 100 l PBS ) and individual chicken serum samples ( 100 l ) was added to different wells of a nonadhesive 96-wellplate . 
The plate was incubated ◦ for at 37 C , 5 % CO2 12 h . 
The content of each well was diluted ( 10 − 1 to 10 − 6 ) with PBS and plated on LB agar plates . 
Each sample was tested in duplicates . 
Controls included wells with the individual serum samples pre-treated at 56 ◦ C for 30 min to inactivate complement ( Anders et al. , 1994 ) . 
A score for the bactericidal activity was calculate as follows : ( ( CFU count heat-inactivated serum − CFU count native serum ) / CFU count heat-inactivated serum ) ) × 100 .

To investigate whether the binding of cMBL was mediated through interaction of the CRD domain with bacterial sugars , competition experiments with 10 g/ml puriﬁed cMBL and a known antagonist ( GlcNAc ) , a chelating agent ( EDTA ) , and a non-antagonist ( galactose ) were performed on the same ﬁve bacterial strains as above .

aureus ( NTCT 06571 ) , and FITC-Zymosan A were opsonised by L10L and L10H serum , which was then phagocytised by HD11 cells ; the gating strategy is shown in Fig. 3 . 
The viability of the designated live cells was conﬁrmed with viability staining using propidium iodide ( data not shown ) . 
No difference in the phagocytosis activity by HD11 cells was obtained when using sera from L10H with a mean of 32.7 ± 6 g/ml compared to using sera from L10L with a mean of 10.4 ± 2 g/ml ( n = 6 ) for S. Montevideo ( P = 0.2930 ) , S. aureus ( P = 0.1940 ) or Zymosan A ( P = 0.1754 ) ( Fig. 4 ) . 
As 10 % sera was used in the experiment , the actual mean concentration of cMBL in the well were approximately 3.2 g/ml for L10H and 1.0 g/ml for L10L . 
The experiments were also conducted with serum concentrations of 2 and 5 % ( data not shown ) and no differences were observed between L10L and L10H serum . 
In the second protocol , puriﬁed cMBL at different concentrations was spiked to both the opsonisation and the phagocytosis step . 
Preliminary data with serum-free opsonisation of phagocytosis resulted in reduced viability of the HD11 cells ( results not shown ) . 
Therefore , a 2 % concentration of serum from an L10L chicken containing 6.9 g/ml cMBL was included in order to maintain good viability of the cells . 
For S. Montevideo ( 123489 ) there was a significant cMBL dose-dependent increase ( P = 0.0104 ) of phagocytosis from 0 to 25 g/ml cMBL ( Fig. 5 ) . 
For S. aureus on the other hand , no cMBL dose-dependent increase of phagocytosis was observed . 
A parallel assay now with unlabelled Zymosan A as a competitor for the cMBL , was performed . 
With Zymosan A as a competitor there was a general signiﬁcant reduction in phagocytosis ( P < 0.0001 ) for S. Montevideo , independent of cMBL concentration , the statistic of this general difference is not highlighted in Fig. 5 . 
A cMBL dose dependency was observed when using Zymosan A together with S. Montevideo from 0 to 25 g/ml ( P = 0.0009 ) and from 10 to 25 g/ml ( P = 0.0037 ) . 
No differences were observed for S. aureus in this experiment .

Part 3—Bactericidal activity towards S. Montevideo and S. aureus
dependent bactericidal activity , S. Montevideo ( S. 123489 ) and S. aureus ( NTCT 06571 ) were incubated in vitro in the presence of heat inactivated and native serum from L10 chickens . 
Following incubation , the CFU in the content of each well was counted . 
As there were equal volumes of serum and bacterial solution in each well , the ﬁnal cMBL concentrations would be half the original mean values , L10H = 26.2 ± 3 g/ml and L10L = 9.2 ± 1 g/ml . 
No signiﬁcant difference between the heat-inactivated and the non heat-inactivated sera was observed in the case of S. Montevideo ( Fig. 6 ) . 
But for S. aureus , the serum from the L10H chickens displayed a signiﬁcantly higher ( P = 0.0009 ) bactericidal activity compared with serum from L10L ( Fig. 6 ) .

to different serotypes of S. enterica because of the multiple repeat-units of mannoses present on its O-antigen , in particular the C1 serogroups ( Schweinle et al. , 1989 ; Kuhlman et al. , 1989 ) . 
The results from our study supports this ﬁnding , as binding of puriﬁed cMBL was found for the C1 serotype of S. enterica only . 
However , MBL failed to bind to one of the tested C1 serotypes ( S. Virchow strain 9676659 ) , but was able to bind to another tested S. Virchow The main purpose of this study was to investigate the function Studies with human MBL have shown that MBL is able to bind strain ( dk0 ) . 
Human MBL binding studies have emphasised that it is important to test independent strains of microorganisms for MBL binding as there is a possibility for structural differences from strain to strain that may inﬂuence the MBL binding ( Neth et al. , 2000 ) . 
Based on our study we hypothesise that inter-strain variation may also inﬂuence cMBL binding ability . 
superfamily , and MBL binding via its CRD is only possible in the presence of calcium ( Holmskov et al. , 1994 ) . 
The order of binding afﬁnity of monosaccharide to cMBL differs from human MBL . 
Human MBL has furthermore been shown to bind to S. aureus in a calcium-dependent manner and with both EDTA and GlcNAc inhibiting the MBL binding ( Neth et al. , 2000 ) . 
Inhibition of human MBL opsonisation of S. Montevideo by yeast mannan , has also been shown ( Kuhlman et al. , 1989 ) . 
In our study , both EDTA and GlcNAc inhibited the cMBL binding to the four S. enterica C1 serotype strains . 
But , the inhibition of cMBL binding by the antagonist GlcNAc was not evident for S. aureus . 
A possible explanation for this may be that the binding of cMBL to S. aureus was up to 10-fold stronger than to the S. enterica strains , indicating a stronger cMBL afﬁnity for binding to S. aureus . 
This may have hindered the inhibition by the antagonist GlcNAc , and not inﬂuenced the chelating agent EDTA . 
Furthermore , as the major cell envelope-associated glycopolymers in S. aureus include wall teichoic acid ( WTA ) , composed of both ManNAc and GlcNAc ( Weidenmaier and Peschel , 2008 ) , this may explain the missing inhibition of the cMBL binding by GlcNAc because of the ranking difference of GlcNAc in chicken and human MBL . 
microbial infection as they readily recognise PAMPs , phagocytise , and produce microbicidal substances , including reactive radical oxygen species ( ROS ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , lysozyme , and proteolytic enzymes ( Okamura et al. , 2003 ; Withanage et al. , 2005 ; Babu et al. , 2009 ) . 
Robust macrophage functionality has been shown to be associated with increased resistance to systemic spread ( Wigley et al. , 2006 ) and intestinal colonisation ( Sun et al. , 2008 ) by Salmonella . 
In our study spiking with puriﬁed cMBL did have a signiﬁcant dose-dependent effect on the HD11 phagocytic activity of S. Montevideo . 
This was further emphasised by Zymosan A 's ability to compete with the cMBL effect . 
Zymosan A was also able to compete with the phagocytosis of S. Montevideo by HD11 cells , without any cMBL spiking , i.e. 2 % chicken serum with a ﬁnal cMBL concentration of approximately 0.14 g/ml . 
Chicken sera are composed of other soluble components than cMBL that may inﬂuence complement activation and/or enhance phagocytic activity , e.g. C-type lectins such as the ﬁcolins ( Lynch et al. , 2005 ) and natural antibodies ( Parmentier et al. , 2004 ) , thus it is possible that these components may have an inﬂuence on the phagocytic activity . 
Studies on the effect of MBL on phagocytic activity to S. aureus are contradictory . 
In a study by Neth et al. ( 2002 ) , human MBL-MASP complexes induced phagocytosis by neutrophils . 
On the other hand , in a study by Brouwer et al. ( 2008 ) human serum MBL did not affect the phagocytic activity of S. aureus by neutrophils . 
In our study , spiking with puriﬁed cMBL did not affect the phagocytic activity of S. aureus by HD11 cells , and addition of Zymosan A did not result in any signiﬁcantly reduced phagocytosis by HD11 cells . 
Additionally , the phagocytic activity by HD11 based on iMFI was 3-fold lower in case of S. aureus than compared with S. Montevideo ( values not shown ) , indicating that cMBL may not favour opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus , but rather complement activation . 
In our bactericidal experiment , this hypothesis was further supported as the cMBL concentration potentially inﬂuences the bactericidal effect on S. aureus . 
serotype and S. aureus , this binding was both dose - and calcium-dependent . 
The antagonist GlcNAc was able to reduce the binding of MBL is member of the C-type or Ca2 + - dependent animal lectin Chicken macrophages play a critical role in the defence against In summary , cMBL was able to bind to S. enterica of the C1 cMBL to the S. enterica strains but this was not observed for S. aureus . 
Opsonophagocytosis of S. Montevideo by HD11 cells with spiking of puriﬁed cMBL was found to be dose-dependent . 
Addition of the antagonistic competitor Zymosan A reduced the opsonophagocytosis of S. Montevideo . 
This cMBL dose dependency and reduction of opsonophagocytic activity by HD11 cells were not observed for S. aureus . 
No difference in bactericidal activity in serum with high or low cMBL concentrations was found for S. Montevideo . 
On the other hand , serum with high concentrations of cMBL exhibited a greater bactericidal activity to S. aureus than serum with low concentrations of cMBL . 
The results presented here , emphasise that chicken cMBL exhibits functional similarities with its mammalian counterparts , i.e. plays a role in opsonophagocytosis and complement activation . 
However , the binding capacity , opsonophagocytic and complement activating effects of cMBL are dependent on not only the pathogen genus , but also the speciﬁc strains in question . 
Further research encompassing more components of the immune system is pivotal for the understanding of the functionality of MBL in chickens .
