tcf ( Typhi colonization factor ) is one of the 12 putative chaperone/usher ﬁmbrial clusters present in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi genome . 
We investigated the production , expression and regulation of tcf as well as its role during interaction with human cells . 
The tcf gene cluster was cloned and induced in Escherichia coli and S. Typhi , and the production of intertwined 
ﬁbres similar to the Cbl ( cable ) pili of Burkholderia cepacia was observed on the bacterial surface by electron microscopy . 
In S. Typhi , tcf was expressed more after growth in M63 minimal medium than in standard Luria -- Bertani medium . 
Analysis of the promoter region identiﬁed putative binding sites for the global regulators RcsB , ArgR and Fur . 
The expression 
of tcf was measured in isogenic strains lacking these global regulators . 
Under the conditions tested , the results showed that tcf expression was higher in the fur mutant and was regulated by iron concentration . 
Fur may regulate these ﬁmbriae indirectly via the small RNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2 . 
An isogenic mutant harbouring a deletion of the tcf cluster did not demonstrate any 
defect in adhesion or invasion of human epithelial cells , or in phagocytosis or survival in macrophages , when compared to the WT serovar Typhi strain . 
However , the tcf cluster contributed to adherence to human epithelial cells when introduced into E. coli . 
Thus , tcf genes encode functional ﬁmbriae that can act as an adhesin and may contribute to colonization during

INTRODUCTION 
Bacterial adhesion to host cells represents the initial and often critical step for pathogenesis . 
Adhesion is commonly mediated by ﬁmbriae , which are structures found on the bacterial surface involved in speciﬁc interactions with host cells . 
Usually , ﬁmbriae are not constitutively expressed and only produced under speciﬁc environmental conditions ( Neidhardt et al. , 1996 ) . 
Fimbrial expression can be controlled positively or negatively at the genetic level . 
Some regulatory mechanisms are unique to speciﬁc strains , whilst others are shared by many bacteria ( Clegg et al. , 2011 ) . 
Some of these mechanisms include invertible DNA elements , DNA methylation , cyclic di-GMP and DNA-binding regulators ( Clegg et al. , 2011 ) . 
Salmonella enterica isolates are classiﬁed into w2500 sero-vars . 
Some serovars can infect different hosts , such as serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) , whereas other serovars display a narrower host range or are speciﬁc to only one host species , such as serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) . 
The latter has no known animal reservoir and is speciﬁc to humans , causing the systemic disease typhoid fever . 
Interestingly , each serovar of Salmonella harbours a unique combination of ﬁmbrial gene clusters , suggesting a role for ﬁmbriae in host adaptation ( Clegg et al. , 2011 ) . 
Genome sequencing analysis has revealed 12 chaperone / usher ﬁmbrial clusters along with curli , a nucleator-depen-dent assembly adhesin and a type IVB pilus in the genome of S. Typhi ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
Little is known concerning conditions of expression and the roles of each of the different ﬁmbrial adhesins in S. enterica . 
Few of these adhesion systems have been characterized so far and none have ever been visualized in S. Typhi . 
Five ﬁmbrial clusters , i.e. sef , sta , ste , stg and tcf , and the type IV pilus present in S. Typhi strains are absent from the genome of S. Typhi-murium , responsible for gastroenteritis in humans ( Townsend et al. , 2001 ) . 
These S. Typhi-speciﬁc adhesion systems may be involved in its host speciﬁcity . 
The tcf ( Typhi colonizing factor ) cluster is of particular interest . 
This 5.2 kb cluster consists of only four genes tcfABCD , encoding , respectively , the chaperone , the major subunit , the usher and the tip adhesin ( Fig. 1a ) . 
Tcf belongs to the alternate chaperone/usher family of the a-ﬁmbrial clade , a group of ﬁmbriae that contains many human-speciﬁc colonization factors ( Nuccio & Bäumler , 2007 ) . 
tcf gene products display sequence homology to those of CS1 ﬁmbriae encoded by the coo operon from the human-adapted enterotoxigenic E. coli ( Folkesson et al. , 1999 ) and to the Cbl ( cable ) pili of Burkholderia cepacia ( Anantha et al. , 2004 ; Nuccio & Bäumler , 2007 ) . 
The tcf genes are located on a 8 kb fragment clustered within the Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -6 that is missing from the genome of the closely related S. Typhimurium and is only found in some serovars ( Bronowski and Winstanley , 2009 ; den Bakker et al. , 2011 ; Suez et al. , 2013 ) . 
It was suggested previously that Tcf may be involved in host speciﬁcity ( Folkesson et al. , 1999 ) .

It has been shown that tcfA is expressed at high salt concentrations but its deletion did not impair bacterial adhesion or invasion of epithelial cells ( Bishop et al. , 2008 ) . 
Furthermore , antibodies against TcfB were detected in the blood of patients with typhoid fever ( Harris et al. , 2006 ) , suggesting that these ﬁmbriae are produced and may play a role during infection . 
However , the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of the tcf genes are still unknown . 
In this study , we characterized the production , expression , regulation and role of tcf during interaction with host cells . 
We demonstrated that the tcf cluster can produce long peritrichous appendages , structurally similar to the Cbl pili that have been characterized in B. cepacia ( Sajjan et al. , 1995 ) . 
The expression of tcf was inﬂuenced by Fur , maybe indirectly via the small RNAs ( sRNAs ) RhyB1 and RhyB2 . 
The production of Tcf in an E. coli K-12 strain increased adhesion to human epithelial cells , whilst its absence in S. Typhi had little impact during the interaction with either epithelial or macrophage cells , probably due to the redundancy of adhesion systems present in S. Typhi that could compensate for the absence of Tcf .

Bacterial strains , plasmids and growth conditions . 
Strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 . 
Bacteria were routinely grown overnight with agitation in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth at 37 uC and on LB agar plates . 
For experiments dependent on iron concentration , bacteria were grown overnight in M63 minimal medium ( low iron ) as described previously ( Leclerc et al. , 2013 ) . 
High-iron conditions were obtained by the addition of 100 mM FeCl3 to M63 medium . 
The M63 minimal medium was inoculated with 1 / 100 dilution of an overnight culture grown in LB washed once in M63 . 
When required , antibiotics or supplements were added at the following concentrations : 50 mg kanamycin ml , 50 mg ampicillin 21 ml , 34 mg chloramphenicol ml , 50 mg diaminopimelic acid ml , 21 21 21 1 mM IPTG and 40 mg X-Gal ml . 
Transformation of 21 bacterial strains was done using the calcium/manganese-based or electroporation methods as described previously ( O'Callaghan et al. , 1990 ) .

Cloning of the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster . 
The tcf gene cluster was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of S. Typhi strain ISP1820 using the Elongase enzyme mixture ( Invitrogen ) with primers tcfAFprom and tcfDR ( Table 2 ) . 
The 5.8 kb PCR product containing the predicted native promoter was puriﬁed and cloned into low-copy-number vector pWSK29 ( Xba I/Not I ) , resulting in plasmid pSIF119 . 
Similarly , tcfABCD was ampliﬁed starting at the predicted start codon of tcfA by Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) using primers tcf_operon_F_SacI and tcf_operon_R_XbaI , and then cloned into the IPTG-inducible vector pMMB207 ( Sac I/Xba I ) , resulting in plasmid pSIF420 . 
The plasmids were transformed into the non-ﬁm-briated E. coli K-12 DﬁmBEACDFGH : : Km mutant strain ORN172 ( Woodall et al. , 1993 ) or into S. Typhi . 
Induction of Tcf : SDS-PAGE and microscopy . 
E. coli or S. Typhi strains harbouring the inducible vector pMMB207 with or without the tcf cluster were grown overnight in LB broth at 37 uC , then diluted 1/100 and cultured to OD600 0.6 . 
The induction was done for 3 or 20 h in the presence of 1 mM IPTG . 
Cell surface proteins were extracted at 60 uC for 15 min . 
Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation ( 3000 g for 10 min ) and the supernatant was precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid . 
Protein concentrations were normalized according to the OD600 of each bacterial suspension . 
Proteins were loaded in a 15 % SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie blue staining . 
The band of interest was cut from the gel , destained and after a trypsin digestion , peptides were sequenced using LC-MS/MS at the Center for Advanced Proteomics Analyses ( IRIC , Université de Montréal ) . 
For microscopy , the induced cultures were washed once with PBS and ﬁxed overnight with 2 % glutaraldehyde . 
The cells were adsorbed onto nickel Formvar/carbon-coated grids for 2 min . 
The grids were washed three times with water . 
Excess liquid was removed and a drop of 0.1 or 0.5 % phosphotungstic acid ( negative stain ) was placed on the grid . 
Cells were examined under a Philips CM-100 electron microscope operated at 60 kV and images were acquired with an AMT XR-80 CCD digital camera system ( Advanced Microscopy Techniques ) .

Generation of a PtcfA -- lacZ transcriptional fusion and b-galactosidase assay . 
The tcfA promoter region was ampliﬁed using the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase enzyme mix ( Invitrogen ) with tcfAFprom ( Eco RI ) and tcfARprom primers . 
The 578 bp PCR fragment was digested with Eco RI , puriﬁed and ligated upstream of the promoterless lacZ gene in pRS415 ( Eco RI/Sma I ) , resulting in plasmid pSIF219 . 
The tcf fusion vector was transformed in the S. Typhi WT strain and the different isogenic mutant strains . 
The expression of tcf was measured by b-galactosidase assay following growth under different conditions or in different background strains . 
b-Galactosidase activity was measured using ONPG as described previously ( Miller , 1972 ) .

Construction of isogenic deletion mutants of S. Typhi . 
A suicide vector was constructed for the deletion of the tcf ﬁmbrial operon from S. Typhi strain ISP1820 . 
A 578 bp fragment of the 59 end of the tcfA gene from S. Typhi was generated by PCR using primers tcfAFprom and tcfARover , and a 226 bp fragment of the 39 end of the tcfD gene was generated by PCR using primers tcfDFover and tcfDR . 
These two fragments were joined by overlapping the sequences in a second PCR using primers tcfAFprom and tcfDR . 
The resulting fragment harbouring an internal deletion of tcf was cloned into the Xba I/Not I sites of pMEG-375 to create pSIF098 . 
Allelic replacement of the tcf region was done as described previously ( Faucher et al. , 2009 ; Kaniga et al. , 1991 ) . 
The isogenic tcf mutant strain harboured a complete deletion of the tcf region , conﬁrmed by PCR ( data not shown ) . 
A similar approach was used to create isogenic argR and rcsDBC deletion mutants . 
All the primers used for these constructions are described in Table 2 . 
Salmonella mutants containing fur , ryhB1 or ryhB2 mutations were described previously ( Leclerc et al. , 2013 ) .

At 1 h before infection , cells were washed three times with prewarmed PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and fresh complete medium was added to each well . 
S. Typhi strains were grown overnight without agitation in LB containing 0.3 M NaCl ( SPI-1-inducing conditions ) and added to each well at m.o.i. 20 : 1 . 
E. coli strains were grown overnight without shaking in LB and added to each well at m.o.i. 100 : 1 .

RESULTS
Tcf production
The tcfABCD cluster ( Fig. 1a ) was cloned into the IPTG-indu-cible plasmid pMMB207 ( pSIF420 ) as ﬁmbriae are often poorly expressed in vitro ( Forest et al. , 2007 ; Humphries et al. , 2003 ; Korea et al. , 2010 ) . 
Tcf was ﬁrst expressed in a non-ﬁmbriated E. coli strain in order to avoid the redundancy of the multiple systems in S. Typhi . 
After induction , cell surface extracts obtained by heat shock to detach bacterial surface proteins revealed a speciﬁc band of * 15 kDa in the strain harbouring the tcfABCD ﬁmbrial genes ( Fig. 1b ) . 
This band was not visible in cell surface extracts of a strain harbouring the empty vector . 
Accordingly , we tested the production in S. Typhi and similar results were obtained . 
However , higher levels of cell lysis were observed and only 3 h induction was necessary to visualize the 15 kDa band ( Fig. 1c ) . 
The 15 kDa band was extracted and sent for amino acid sequencing . 
MS analyses identiﬁed TcfB , the predicted Tcf major structural protein , in extracts from both E. coli and S. Typhi . 
In S. Typhi , 44 speciﬁc peptides with 100 % probability corresponding to TcfB were identiﬁed , covering 148/191 aa , representing 100 % of the predicted mature protein ( 148 aa ) . 
The production of extracellular ﬁmbrial structures on the bacterial surface was investigated by transmission electron microscopy ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Induced expression of Tcf resulted in the production of elongated ﬁmbriae-like structures on the E. coli bacterial surface ( Fig. 2a ) , whereas no similar structure was observed on the surface of the strain harbouring the empty vector ( Fig. 2b ) . 
When Tcf was induced in S. Typhi , abundant and long extracellular appendages were observed ( Fig. 2c ) . 
The peritrichous ﬁlaments were intertwined , forming bundles ( Fig. 2d ) and a network of ﬁbres between bacteria ( Fig. 2e ) . 
These ﬁmbriae closely resembled Cbl pili of B. cepacia ( Sajjan et al. , 1995 ) . 
Expression of tcf
To investigate tcf expression , a transcriptional fusion between the tcfA promoter and the lacZ gene coding for b-galactosidase was constructed using the plasmid pRS415 and introduced into S. Typhi . 
The effect of the growth phase on tcf expression was studied with bacteria grown in LB medium . 
b-Galactosidase expression was low during the exponential phase , and increased in the stationary phase and on solid medium ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The expression reached its maximum level after 24 h incubation ( overnight shaking ) . 
tcf expression was also evaluated during growth conditions used for SPI-1 induction ( invasion ) ( overnight in LB containing 0.3 M NaCl without agitation ) or for SPI-2 induction ( survival in macrophages ) ( stationary , overnight in LB without agitation ) . 
Under these conditions , tcf expression levels were similar to the late exponential phase with agitation . 
Finally , growth in minimal medium ( M63 , overnight shaking ) was tested and gave the highest tcf expression levels , and was used for the rest of the study ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Regulation of tcf expression
To understand the regulation involved in tcf transcription , bioinformatics analysis of the tcfA promoter region was performed . 
Putative binding sites for H-NS , RcsB , Fur and ArgR were identiﬁed using the bacterial promoter analysis software Softberry Bprom ( www.softberry.com ) ( Fig. 4a ) . 
Putative regulation by the global regulators RcsB , Fur and ArgR was evaluated by generating three isogenic S. Typhi deletion mutants of rcsDBC , fur and argR . 
H-NS deletion is pleiotropic and was not investigated . 
The tcfA -- lacZ reporter plasmid was transformed into the mutant strains and b-galactosidase activity was measured from strains grown overnight in M63 with agitation . 
No difference in tcf expression was observed when comparing the argR mutant and the rcsDBC mutant with the WT strain ( Fig. 4b ) . 
However , the transcription of tcf was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by Fur . 
The expression of tcf signiﬁcantly increased in the fur mutant in comparison with the WT strain . 
Therefore , these results suggested that the presence of the iron regulator Fur inhibited the expression of the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster . 
Role of iron , Fur and the sRNAs RyhB1/RyhB2 in regulation of tcf expression 
As the Fur regulator is activated by iron and the regulation of its target genes is usually iron-dependent , the regulation of tcf by iron levels ( high and low ) was investigated in the WT and fur mutant strains . 
The expression of tcf was lower under high-iron conditions for each strain ( Fig. 5a ) . 
This result was in accordance with the Fur-dependent repression of tcf expression , because Fur binding activity occurs under iron-rich conditions ( Escolar et al. , 1999 ) . 
Tcf expression was lower in the WT strain under both high - and lowiron conditions ( Fig. 5a ) . 
Interestingly , Tcf expression was signiﬁcantly higher in the fur mutant under low-iron conditions , where fur is usually inactive . 
The tcf cluster is absent in S. Typhimurium and in E. coli , but Fur is conserved in these strains . 
To determine whether Fur regulation of tcf was speciﬁc to S. Typhi , the tcfA -- lacZ reporter plasmid was transformed into S. Typhimurium and E. coli K-12 and their isogenic fur mutants . 
b-Galacto-sidase production was measured from strains grown overnight in M63 . 
The expression of tcf was signiﬁcantly higher in the fur mutant of Salmonella , but not in the fur mutant of E. coli ( Fig. 5b ) . 
Fur has been shown to indirectly regulate gene transcription through the repression of RNA RyhB in E. coli ( Massé & Gottesman , 2002 ) . 
As there are two homologues of RyhB in Salmonella , i.e. RyhB1 ( RfrA ) and RyhB2 ( RfrB ) , we investigated the role of each of these sRNAs in tcf expression . 
Isogenic mutants ryhB1 and/or ryhB2 were generated in the WT S. Typhi strain and in the fur mutant . 
The tcfA -- lacZ reporter plasmid was transformed into the mutant strains and b-galactosidase production was measured from strains grown overnight in M63 . 
No difference in tcf expression was observed when comparing the ryhB1 or ryhB2 mutant strains to the WT strain ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Interestingly , tcf expression signiﬁcantly decreased with the loss of both sRNAs compared with the WT strain ( Fig. 6 ) . 
tcf expression also signiﬁcantly decreased with the loss of each sRNA in the fur mutant . 
No regulation was observed with the deletion of all three regulators ( the triple mutant ) , as the level of expression of tcf was not signiﬁcantly different from that of the WT ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Thus , the sRNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2 seemed to play a role in the expression of the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster .

Role of Tcf during interaction with host cells
As ﬁmbriae are commonly known to play an important role in association with host epithelial cells , we investigated the potential role of the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster during interaction with INT-407 epithelial cells . 
The effect of complete deletion of the tcfABCD ﬁmbrial cluster on adherence and invasion was assessed by determining the number of bacteria associated with epithelial cells after 90 or 180 min of co-culture . 
No difference was observed in the number of bacteria associated with epithelial cells during adhesion or invasion assays between the tcf mutant and the WT strain ( Fig. 7a ) . 
As other adhesion systems may compensate for the absence of Tcf in S. Typhi , the complete tcf cluster was cloned under its native promoter in the low-copy-number plasmid pWSK29 , and the construct was transformed into non-ﬁmbriated E. coli K-12 strain ORN172 . 
The introduction of tcf into E. coli conferred a signiﬁcantly higher level of adherence to epithelial cells ( P50 .0078 ) , which was two-fold higher than the level of adherence of the strain containing the empty vector ( Fig. 7b ) .

The role of Tcf was also investigated during the interaction of S. Typhi with human macrophages , as S. Typhi survives within these cells during typhoid fever . 
Phagocytosis was measured after 20 min ( 0 h ) and survival after 2 and 24 h of interaction between the bacteria and cells . 
Slight differences in the amounts of bacteria recovered at each time point were observed between the WT and DtcfABCD mutant ( Fig. 7c ) .

Collectively , these results indicated that under the in vitro conditions tested , Tcf had a limited role during S. Typhi interaction with host cells but that the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster encoded functional ﬁmbriae playing a role in adherence when expressed in a non-ﬁmbriated E. coli strain .

DISCUSSION
S. Typhi possesses 12 putative chaperone/usher loci , few of these ﬁmbrial systems having been characterized to date . 
In this study , we demonstrated that the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster can produce functional ﬁmbriae . 
To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time that a ﬁmbrillar structure of S. Typhi has been visualized on the bacterial surface by microscopy . 
Tcf produced unusual , long , intertwined appendages similar to the Cbl pili of B. cepacia ( Sajjan et al. , 1995 ) . 
Cbl pili belong to the a-ﬁmbrial class ( Nuccio & Bäumler , 2007 ) . 
Phylogenetic analyses have shown that Tcf and Cbl are predicted to be more closely related to each other than to other members of the a-ﬁm-briae , such as CS and CFA/I ﬁmbriae ( Anantha et al. , 2004 ; Nuccio & Bäumler , 2007 ) . 
TcfB shares 44 % identity and 64 % similarity to CblA from B. cepacia strain BC7 . 
Furthermore , the unusual cable structures of Tcf and Cbl are distinct from thinner , more typical ﬁmbrial morphologies observed for CS1 and CFA/1 ﬁmbriae .

One way to obtain information concerning Tcf ﬁmbrial expression is to use a tcfA -- lacZ transcriptional fusion on a vector to measure the transcription levels of the tcf genes and to detect slight changes in gene expression . 
tcfA was expressed during growth in LB , with the highest level obtained in the late stationary phase ( overnight ) , which also corresponds to conditions under which nutrients , including iron , begin to be depleted . 
High expression in the stationary phase was observed previously for several ﬁmbriae of E. coli O157 : H7 ( Low et al. , 2006 ) , as well as for Stg of S. Typhi ( Forest et al. , 2007 ) . 
The highest expression of tcfA was after overnight growth in a minimal medium ( M63 ) . 
A previous study showed that tcfA expression was low in the stationary phase using reverse transcription PCR , and it was enhanced when bacteria were grown overnight without agitation with high salt concentrations ( SPI-1-inducing conditions ) ( Bishop et al. , 2008 ) . 
Our results showed that the transcription of tcf was not increased under SPI-1-inducing conditions and was not inﬂuenced by the addition of salt when grown overnight without agitation . 
The differences in tcf expression in these two studies may be due to the methods used ( reverse transcription PCR compared to transcriptional fusion ) and/or the strains used ( BRD948 compared with ISP1820 ) . 
Overall , we have shown that the S. Typhi tcf cluster can be expressed during in vitro growth conditions . 
Regulation of gene expression is usually achieved by the binding of regulatory proteins in the region of the promo-ter , and mutations in this region can affect transcription by altering the afﬁnity of a protein ( regulator or RNA polymerase ) to its binding site . 
Analysis of the regulatory region of tcfA identiﬁed putative binding sites for the regulators H-NS , ArgR , RcsB and Fur ( Fig. 4a ) . 
H-NS is known to repress the transcription of many ﬁmbriae ( Corcoran & Dorman , 2009 ; Korea et al. , 2010 ; Müller et al. , 2006 ; Nicholson & Low , 2000 ; Torres et al. , 2007 ; White-Ziegler et al. , 2000 ) in E. coli and Salmonella , including the Tcf homologue CS1 ﬁmbriae ( Murphree et al. , 1997 ) . 
As H-NS regulation was expected and the phenotype of the H-NS mutant is pleiotropic , its role was not investigated further . 
ArgR is a repressor of arginine metabolism genes and is involved in Xer-mediated recombination as an accessory factor ( Paul & Summers , 2004 ) . 
Its role as a regulator of ﬁmbrial expression has not been demonstrated , and the absence of ArgR had no effect on the transcription of tcfA . 
Rcs was shown to be involved in the regulation of ﬁmbrial gene expression in different bacteria , in particular in the repression of the pil genes coding for the S. Typhi type IVB pili ( Lee et al. , 2006 ; Lehti et al. , 2012 ) . 
The absence of the Rcs global regulatory system did not alter tcf expression under the conditions we investigated ( Fig. 4b ) . 
Fur represents a global regulator activated by iron and is involved in iron homeostasis ( Escolar et al. , 1999 ) . 
Interestingly , both homologues of Tcf , i.e. Cbl and CFA/I , were also shown to be repressed by iron ( Karjalainen et al. , 1991 ; Tomich & Mohr , 2004 ) , suggesting the involvement of the iron regulator Fur . 
Our data showed that Fur represses tcf expression ( Fig. 4b ) , whereas low iron conditions increased it . 
As fur is inactiv-ated under low iron availability ( Escolar et al. , 1999 ) , these results correlated with the increased expression of tcf in the fur mutant . 
Interestingly , the regulation of tcf by Fur was observed in S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi , but not in E. coli , although Fur is highly conserved between these genera , suggesting an indirect mechanism of regulation by Fur that is speciﬁc to Salmonella .

Role of the tcf ﬁmbrial cluster during interaction with human cells . 
( a ) INT-407 epithelial cells were infected with the S. Typhi ISP1820 WT strain and the isogenic tcfABCD mutant . 
The number of bacteria ( c.f.u. ml21 ) associated with the cells was determined after adherence ( 90 min ) and invasion ( 180 min ) . 
( b ) INT-407 epithelial cells were infected with the non-ﬁmbriated E. coli Dﬁm strains harbouring the empty vector ( pWSK29 ) or the vector with tcf cluster ( pWSK-tcfABCD ) , and the number of bacteria ( c.f.u. ml21 ) associated with the cells was determined after adherence ( 90 min ) . 
( c ) THP-1 macrophages were infected with the S. Typhi WT or isogenic tcfABCD mutant strains , and the number of bacteria ( c.f.u. ml21 ) associated with the cells was determined after uptake ( 0 h ) and during survival ( 2 and 24 h ) in macrophages . 
All assays were conducted in duplicate and repeated independently at least three times . 
The results are expressed as mean ¡ SEM of the replicate experiments . 
* Signiﬁcant difference in the number of bacteria recovered between the different strains ( P ,0.05 ) . 
Fur represses transcription of the sRNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2 in S. Typhi ( Leclerc et al. , 2013 ) . 
Therefore , Fur might indirectly repress tcf expression by repressing these sRNAs , as loss of fur or growth in low iron concomitantly increases expression of both sRNAs ( RyhB1 and RyhB2 ) and tcf . 
Furthermore , we have shown that the double ryhB1/ryhB2 mutant exhibited signiﬁcantly less tcf promo-ter activity compared with the WT strain ( Fig. 6 ) . 
In fact , the sRNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2 appear to play a role as positive regulators of tcf . 
However , it is difﬁcult to determine if the regulation of tcf expression by these sRNAs is by direct or indirect mechanisms . 
As there is only one RyhB in E. coli , it could explain why there was no regulation of tcf observed and why the regulation was speciﬁc to Salmonella , as both sRNAs may be needed for regulation of tcf ( Fig. 6 ) . 
This may also suggest that some other system ( absent in E. coli ) is affected in Salmonella and changes the regulation of Tcf . 
More studies are needed to investigate and better understand the regulation mechanism of tcf . 
We have also characterized the role of the tcf cluster of S. Typhi during the interaction with host cells . 
As ﬁmbriae are normally used to mediate adherence to host cells , we compared the interaction of the WT and isogenic tcf deletion mutant strains with epithelial cells . 
No signiﬁcant difference was observed between the adhesion and invasion levels of both strains ( Fig. 7a ) , con-ﬁrming previous experiments ( Bishop et al. , 2008 ) . 
Some Salmonella ﬁmbrial clusters were shown to be involved in the interaction with macrophages in different in vitro experiments and in long-term infection processes in different in vivo models ( Edwards et al. , 2000 ; Forest et al. , 2007 ; Klumpp & Fuchs , 2007 ; Lawley et al. , 2006 ; van der Velden et al. , 1998 ) . 
Thus , we also evaluated the role of the tcf mutant in the interaction with human cultured macro-phages , and despite the slight variations in the number of bacteria recovered during the infection for the WT and the tcf mutant strains , no statistically signiﬁcant difference was observed ( Fig. 7c ) . 
Thus , the absence of the tcf cluster did not have any effect during interaction with host cells . 
Redundancy of ﬁmbrial systems may explain the absence of a phenotype , or the presence of iron in the tissue culture medium ( in the serum ) may repress tcf expression . 
However , it is common for bacteria to possess multiple virulence factors that have functional similarity . 
Redundancy is usually seen during the adhesion process of bacteria , which can use multiple adhesins to increase their interaction with host cells ( Virji , 2009 ) . 
Therefore , it is possible that the true function of Tcf was masked by the presence of another system during the interaction with epithelial cells and macrophages , as S. Typhi harbours 12 different ﬁmbrial clusters as well as many other putative adhesins ( Forest & Daigle , 2012 ; Townsend et al. , 2001 ) . 
Although the Tcf ﬁmbrial cluster is dispensable for the interaction of S. Typhi with epithelial and macrophage cells under the conditions described here , we can not discount a role for Tcf in human infection as antibodies against TcfB were detected following typhoid fever in human serum ( Harris et al. , 2006 ) . 
In order to avoid redundancy , the tcf cluster was cloned under its native promoter and transformed in a non-ﬁmbriated E. coli strain . 
The adhesion to epithelial cells was signiﬁcantly higher in the presence of tcf ( Fig. 7b ) . 
Adhesion phenotype mediated by ﬁmbrial genes expressed in E. coli strains was observed for other Salmonella ﬁmbriae , such as Stg and Sef ( Forest et al. , 2007 ; Rank et al. , 2009 ) , conﬁrming that ﬁmbriae can contribute to the interaction with host cells . 
As ﬁmbriae are exposed to the immune system they are candidates for vaccine development , and this is why it is important to understand their regulation and the role played by each ﬁmbrial operon . 
To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report demonstrating that the Tcf ﬁmbrial cluster of S. Typhi is functional and , when expressed , produces unusual morphology similar to the Cbl pili of B. cepacia . 
Furthermore , Fur and the sRNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2 play a role in Tcf regulation . 
Further research is needed to demonstrate the speciﬁc mechanism of tcf expression in vitro and during the infection process .
