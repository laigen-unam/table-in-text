The LysR-type transcriptional regulators ( LTTRs ) are widely distributed in various genera of prokaryotes . 
LTTRs are DNA binding proteins that can positively or negatively regulate target gene expression and can also repress their own transcription . 
Salmonella enterica comprises a group of Gram-negative bacteria capable of causing clinical syndromes that range from self-limiting diarrhoea to severe ﬁbrinopurulent necrotizing enteritis and life threatening systemic disease . 
The survival and replication of Salmonella in macrophages and in infected host is brought about by the means of various two component regulatory systems , transporters and other virulence islands . 
In Salmonella genome the existence of 44 LTTRs has been documented . 
These LTTRs regulate bacterial stress response , systemic virulence in mice and also many virulence determinants in vitro . 
Here we focus on the ﬁndings that elucidate the structure and Salmo function of the LTTRs in nella and discuss the importance of these LTTRs in making Salmonella a successful pathogen .

Introduction 
anaerobic bacteria that can survive inside the host macrophages and cause persistent infection . 
Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori are the two species under the genera ` Salmonella ' . 
S. enterica is divided into seven phylogenetic groups , subspecies 1 , 2 , 3a , 3b , 4 , 6 and 7 . 
Subspecies 1 includes 1367 serovars , some of which are commonly isolated from infected birds and mammals ( Reeves et al. , 1989 ) . 
The other subspecies mainly colonize the cold-blooded animals . 
Salmonella Typhimurium , Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Enteritidis are the serovars , which belong to the Salmonella enterica species . 
S. Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans . 
Clinical features include stepladder type fever , malaise , headache , splenomegaly , coated tongue , neutropenia , etc. and may be fatal if untreated . 
S. Typhimurium is one of the important causes for food poisoning in humans . 
It causes typhoid like fever in mice and serves as a good model system to study Salmonella pathogenesis . 
Genus Salmonella is a Gram-negative rod shaped facultative intestinal lumen or via a forced entry in the non-phagocytic enterocytes . 
Upon entry Salmonella resides in an intracellular phagosomal compartment called Salmonella containing vacuole ( SCV ) . 
The SCV only transiently acquires endocytic markers like TfnR , EEA1 , Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab11 and Rab7 . 
It eventually uncouples from the endocytic pathway to avoid lysosomal fusion and ultimately reaches the golgi apparatus achieving a perinuclear position . 
Herein , the Salmonella replicates forming tubulovesicular SCV structures called Salmonella induced ﬁlaments ( Sifs ) . 
Mostly , Salmonella infections remain localized to the intestine causing inﬂammation and leading to diarrhoea . 
However , in the case of typhoid fever , Salmonella survives in intestinal macrophages and gets disseminated to the liver and spleen via blood and lymph . 
Salmonella infection is mediated by over thirty effector proteins secreted via two distinct type three secretion systems encoded in the pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 ( McGhie et al. , 2009 ) . 
Additional secretion systems include sci encoded ( S. enterica centisome 7 genomic island ) type IV secretion system and the Zir TS pathway . 
SPI-1 effectors SipA , SipC , SopB , SopD , SopE and SopE2 induce membrane deformation and rearrangement of the underlying actin cytoskeleton or ` membrane rufﬂing ' triggering bacterial uptake into SCVs . 
The SPI-2 effector SpiC prevents fusion of SCVs with lysosomes . 
The SPI-2 effectors promote intracellular bacterial replication and systemic spread by preventing colocalization with iNOS and Gp91Phox and suppress reactive oxygen and nitrogen species mediated killing of the bacteria ( Chakravortty et al. , 2002 ) .

LysR-type transcriptional regulators , ﬁrst described in 1988 , are present in diverse bacterial genera , archaea and algal chloroplasts . 
Current knowledge about the role of the LysR family proteins in bacteria is rapidly increasing with the discovery of structure and function of new LTTRs ( Maddocks and Oyston , 2008 ) . 
The LTTRs regulate the expression of diverse linked or unlinked genes and their functions . 
Biochemical studies of various LTTRs show that they are similar sized molecules ( 300 -- 350 amino acids ) that activate the transcription of operons and regulons involved in extremely diverse cellular functions including nitrogen ﬁxation , oxidative stress response and bacterial virulence ( Schell , 1993 ) . 
Most LTTRs , while activating expression of target genes , repress their own expression , frequently by the use of divergent promoters . 
In common with other bacterial transcription factors , LTTRs can act as homodimers or homotetramers ( Zaim and Kierzek , 2003 ) . 
According to secondary structure prediction methods , the DNA binding domain of LTTRs is likely to form a helix-turn-helix ( HTH ) motif ( Kullik et al. , 1995 ) . 
Most LTTRs require a small molecule ligand to act as a coinducer and binding site of the inducer has been mapped to the C-terminal part ( Fig. 1 ) . 
have been explored in great detail . 
For a successful pathogen like Salmonella , it is extremely crucial to critically regulate the repertoire of genes that are expressed under different growth conditions , which is accomplished by virtue of these LTTRs . 
Recent studies have also focused on the correlation between the LTTRs and the stress response in Salmonella . 
In virulence gene regulation the function of LysR family proteins

bacterial survival and pathogenicity ( Maddocks and Oyston , 2008 ) . 
Salmonella , being a successful pathogen also has several LTTRs and the function of few of them have been elucidated in great detail . 
In this review we will summarize the importance of the LTTRs to better understand the Salmonella biology . 
We will conclude by brieﬂy speculating how studies exploring new LTTRs might prove to be a fruitful avenue of further research . 
The LysR-type regulators are proving to be critically important in 
4.1. SpvR
troversial , however it has been shown that a plasmid-cured strain when complemented with the spv locus is sufﬁcient to restore the virulence phenotype ( Rotger and Casadesus , 1999 ) . 
The spv region in the Salmonella plasmid is composed of ﬁve genes spvRABCD which are present in a regulon . 
The regulator of the locus , SpvR , is a 33-kDa LysR-type protein and several approaches have been taken to elucidate the mode of gene regulation by SpvR . 
SpvR induces the expression of the spvABCD operon and its own expression in the stationary phase of bacterial growth and inside the macrophages . 
Gel mobility shift assays revealed that the SpvR fusion proteins were able to bind to 125 - and 147-bp DNA fragments of the spvA and spvR promoter regions , respectively ( Grob and Guiney , 1996 ) . 
In addition , it has also been shown by biochemical and genetic analyses that two chromosomally encoded DNA binding proteins control spv operon expression . 
Integration host factor ( IHF ) binds to DNA sequences upstream of the spvR regulatory region , and the leucine-responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) binds to sequences upstream of the spvABCD operon and regulate spv expression ( Marshall et al. , 1999 ) . 
The exact role of the virulence plasmid of Salmonella is con ¬ 
The regulation of the spv locus by SpvR was found to be activated only in vivo further indicating the role of this LTTR in virulence . 
In addition , the cold shock response protein polynucleotide phosphorylase in Salmonella , a global regulator of virulence and persistence , is also known to negatively control spv gene expression ( Ygberg et al. , 2006 ) . 
The essential function of SpvR in regulating virulence gene expression becomes much clearer with the elucidation of the functions of the downstream target genes . 
spvB encodes an ADP-ribosylating enzyme that uses actin as a substrate and depolymerizes actin ﬁlaments when expressed in different cell lines and is also involved in virulence in the mice model ( Lesnick et al. , 2001 ) . 
In a recent paper in C. elegans model of infection using Salmonella Typhimurium , it has been demonstrated that along with PhoP regulon , SPI-1 , SPI-2 and SpvR is also induced in the C. elegans intestine . 
Isogenic strains lacking spvR exhibited signiﬁcant defects in the ability to persist in the worm intestine clearly pointing to the very essential role of this LTTR in virulence ( Alegado and Tan , 2008 ) . 
4.2. LeuO
Another LTTR , LeuO is known to be involved in the stress response regulation in various bacteria ( Fang et al. , 2000 ) . 
In Salmonella Typhi LeuO is shown to positively regulate the porin gene expression and regulate the virulence of bacteria ( Fernandez-Mora et al. , 2004 ) . 
The ompC and ompF genes encode the two major porins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella . 
In Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Typhimurium , the ompS1 and ompS2 genes code for two other porins that are expressed at very low levels , relative to the major porins OmpC and OmpF , under standard laboratory conditions . 
Curiously , ompS1 is negatively regulated by the HN-S nucleoid protein , and ompS2 is positively regulated by the LeuO regulator by derepressing the HN-S action . 
In addition , the very fact that both the porin and leuO mutants are attenuated in mice model also suggests the importance of this LTTR ( RodriguezMorales et al. , 2006 ) . 
Moreover it has been reported that LeuO and the silencing proteins H-NS and StpA are the main positive and negative regulators of ompS1 expression in Salmonella . 
LeuO positively regulates the ompS1 expression by derepressing both the promoters and antagonizing the negative effect of H-NS and StpA . 
LeuO has been shown to displace them from the 5 ′ regulatory region of the ompS1 gene . 
In this study , LeuO was found to bind upstream and not to interact with the ompS1 promoter region ( De la Cruz et al. , 2007 ) . 
In one interesting study , it has been shown that the role of LeuO was directly involved in the bacterial stringent response . 
LeuO was shown to be indispensable for growth resumption following a 2-h growth arrest caused by starvation for branched-chain amino acids in an E. coli K-12 relA1 strain . 
It was speculated that the leuO expression is regulated in a complex autoregulatory manner in bacteria ( Majumder et al. , 2001 ) . 
Apparently , ppGpp is required for triggering the stringent response including the leuO expression . 
However , a ppGpp level-independent regulatory mechanism determines the transient leuO expression in the bacteria ( Fang et al. , 2000 ) . 
A recent study has depicted the presence of seven LeuO regulated proteins having diverse function in Salmonella Typhi ( Hernandez-Lucas et al. , 2008 ) . 
A genomic analysis revealed that LeuO is a positive regulator of OmpS1 , OmpS2 , AssT , and STY3070 . 
In contrast , LeuO down-regulated the expression of OmpX , Tpx , and STY1978 . 
These genes are required for several functions like swarming , motility , oxidative stress response and DNA repair the genetic and physiological response to oxidative stress in bacteria and the role of LTTRs in this regard . 
Low dose of H2O2 treatment in Salmonella leads to elevated levels of synthesis of 30 proteins . 
OxyR , a LysR-type regulator , is known to positively regulate 9 of them ( Christman et al. , 1985 ) . 
OxyR is unlinked to its target and lacks the characteristic divergent promoter . 
The downstream genes regulated by OxyR that play crucial role in oxidative stress response are HPI catalase ( encoded by katG ) and subunits of alkyl hydroperoxidase ( ahp ) genes . 
Curiously , neither inactivation of the oxyR gene nor constitutive over expression of the oxyR-regulated proteins ( oxyR1 allele ) could alter bacterial resistance to neutrophils ( Papp-Szabo et al. , 1994 ) . 
In the same study it was reported that the mutation in the katG gene was also without effect on Salmonella survival suggesting OxyR is not essential for bacterial survival in vivo . 
Of course , it also raises the possibility of other OxyR homologues regulating similar genes . 
During intestinal colonization of Salmonella it was further shown that OxyR does not play a role as a virulence factor ( Rychlik and Barrow , 2005 ) . 
increased sensitivity towards hydrogen peroxide and this has been attributed due to the down-regulation of oxyR regulon in this condition ( Greenacre et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , in Salmonella , OxyR is essential for survival upon exposure to adrenaline . 
The oxyR mutant survived signiﬁcantly less than the wild type counterpart in the presence of adrenaline . 
It is hypothesized that oxyR is induced upon adrenaline response and keeps the defense genes ready to counteract the host derived peroxide stress in the gut ( Karavolos et al. , 2008 ) . 
Tremendous progress has been made towards understanding In another study , lactic acid adapted Salmonella showed

4.4. Hrg and STM1625
STM1625 were shown to be up-regulated upon bacterial entry inside the host macrophage . 
In a comparative study , we have shown that STM0952 ( named as hydrogen peroxide resistance gene , hrg ) but not STM1625 plays a crucial role in Salmonella virulence inside the macrophages ( Lahiri et al. , 2008 ) . 
Hrg , a 33 kDa LTTR imparts survival advantage to the bacteria in the mice model of infection . 
A null mutant was found to be hypersensitive to H2O2 stress and produced higher amount of reactive oxygen species than the wild type Salmonella . 
From the microarray studies , it was observed that in the presence of H2O2 , catalase hydroperoxidase HPI ( katG ) , uvrA and DNA polymerase III theta subunit ( holE ) were down-regulated signiﬁcantly in the knockout strain when compared to the wild type control . 
UvrA and DNA polymerase III are required to repair the DNA damage by H2O2 . 
Thus , there is a possibility of a co-regulation of katG by both OxyR and Hrg in Salmonella . 
Out of the 44 LTTRs present in Salmonella , STM0952 and 
4.5. CysB and MetR
different LTTRs and CysB is one of them that regulate the cysteine production . 
In the infected host , under limiting nutrient condition tight control of the amino acid biosynthesis might be a survival strategy for the virulent Salmonella . 
Further it can be hypothesized that these LTTRs might prove to be a new drug target against the bacteria . 
ence of the inducer N-acetyl-l-serine CysB facilitates the formation of a transcription initiation complex . 
CysB protein also autoregulates its own synthesis by binding to the cysB promoter as a In Salmonella , amino acid biosynthesis is tightly regulated by The cys regulon is under the positive control of CysB . 
In the pres-using oriented RNAP indicated that a single CTD on either the or the ′ - associated subunit is sufﬁcient for the MetR activation of metE , while MetR interacts preferentially with the CTD on the - associated subunit at metH ( Fritsch et al. , 2000 ) . 
repressor . 
CysB protected sequences are weakly dyadic . 
In addition to cysteine synthesis , cysB is also involved in carbon utilization in Salmonella ( Quan et al. , 2002 ) . 
cysB mutants of E. coli and Salmonella , along with being auxotrophs for cysteine , exhibit increased resistance to the antibiotics like novobiocin and mecillinam ( Lilic et al. , 2003 ) . 
On swarm plates expression of the entire cys operon was induced . 
Cysteine biosynthesis was shown to be crucial for the complete swarm cell differentiation . 
Further , cysB mutants were unable to swarm unless cysteine was supplemented to the medium ( Turnbull and Surette , 2008 ) . 
MetR is another LysR-type regulator in Salmonella which positively regulates metA , metE and metH . 
MetE and MetH enzymes are required for the methionine biosynthesis .

tiple loci and control the bacterial survival and virulence . 
The direct role of some of the LTTRs have been elucidated and found to give survival advantage to Salmonella in the infected host . 
LTTRs play pivotal roles in the Salmonella stress response as indicated by the presence of multiple LTTRs ( Table 1 ) . 
To what extent do these LTTRs help the bacteria and what is the relative signiﬁcance in vivo ? 
A recent study by our group allows for an approximate answer to these questions . 
When two different LTTRs were characterized in Salmonella , it was observed that they serve totally different purposes ( Lahiri et al. , 2008 ) . 
This information suggests the critical regulation that can be played by the LTTRs by modulating the gene expression . 
The differential function played by these two LTTRs hint that LTTRs are not redundant proteins , rather they have speciﬁc functions in different conditions . 
The crucial role played by the LTTRs might vary depending on the growth condition or the cell type in which the bacteria is residing . 
Salmonella and their functions are listed in Fig. 2 . 
In addition to the genes and proteins discussed above , future studies should focus on new LTTRs and their target genes and regulation . 
Interplay between different LTTRs might be a fruitful avenue of further research in Salmonella biology . 
As discussed above , different LTTRs in Salmonella regulate mul-Different LTTRs and their characterized target genes till date in
