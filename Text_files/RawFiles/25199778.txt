We successfully produced two human - defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) in bacteria as functional peptides and tested their anti-bacterial activities against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus aureus employing both spectroscopic and viable CFU count methods . 
Puriﬁed peptides showed approximately 50 % inhibition of the bacterial population when used individually and up to 90 % when used in combination . 
The 50 % lethal doses ( LD50 ) of hBD-1 against S. Typhi , E. coli , and S. aureus were 0.36 , 0.40 , and 0.69 g / l , respectively , while those for hBD-2 against the same bacteria were 0.38 , 0.36 , and 0.66 g / l , respectively . 
Moreover , we observed that bacterium-derived antimicrobial peptides were also effective in increasing survival time and decreasing bacterial loads in the peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen of a mouse intraperitoneally infected with S. Typhi . 
The 1:1 hBD-1 / hBD-2 combination showed maximum effectiveness in challenging the Salmonella infection in vitro and in vivo . 
We also observed less tissue damage and sepsis formation in the livers of infected mice after treatment with hBD-1 and hBD-2 peptides individually or in combination . 
Based on these ﬁndings , we conclude that bacterium-derived recombinant - de-fensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) are promising antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) - based substances for the development of new therapeutics against typhoid fever . 
Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and other nontyphoidal Salmonella infections occur as a result of ingestion of contaminated food or water or through close contact with an infected individual and lead to 200,000 to 600,000 deaths annually ( 1 -- 5 ) . 
Still , typhoid fever continues to be endemic in regions like Southeast Asia , India , sub-Saharan Africa , and South America due to the inadequate sewage treatment facilities , high populations , and poor hygienic conditions in these regions ( 6 , 7 ) . 
Young children and immunocompromised people are particularly susceptible to severe Salmonella infections and suffer from several life-threatening complications , such as intestinal perforation , internal bleeding , neurological damage , and hypotensive shock ( 3 , 8 , 9 ) . 
Typhoid fever can be effectively controlled by appropriate antibiotics ( 5 ) . 
There is strong evidence that the ﬂuoroquinolones are the most effective drugs for the treatment of typhoid fever ( 10 , 11 ) , but these drugs cause miserable side effects . 
Concerns about the use of ﬂuoroquinolones include ( i ) their toxic effects in children , ( ii ) their cost , and ( iii ) the emergence of resistance against ﬂuoroquinolones in bacteria . 
S. Typhi isolates showing resistance to ﬁrst - and second-line and broad-spectrum antibiotics are spreading ( 12 -- 14 ) . 
The use of antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) alone or in combination is receiving worldwide attention as an alternative therapy for controlling microbial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms because of AMPs ' selectivity , speed of action , and inherent immunological compatibility ( 15 -- 17 ) . 
Defensins , a novel class of human endogenous antimicrobial peptides , the important component of innate immunity , have shown great prom-ise for their antimicrobial activities against a diverse range of microorganisms , including bacteria , fungi , and viruses . 
Human - defensins ( 3 to 5 kDa ) are cysteine-rich small cat-ionic peptides with - sheet-like structures which play a crucial role in innate immunity to provide the ﬁrst-line antimicrobial barrier for mucosal surfaces of the eye , tracheobronchial tree , gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts , and lungs ( 18 -- 21 ) . 
The mode of antibiotic action of defensins is believed to result from electrostatic interaction between the positively charged defensins and the negatively charged microbial membranes , followed by unspeciﬁc membrane pore formation leading to cytoplasmic leakage and cell death ( 22 -- 24 ) . 
In 2003 , Salzman et al. ( 25 ) demonstrated that expression of human defensins in transgenic mice resulted in protection against enteric salmonellosis . 
This encouraged us to study the competence of bacterium-derived recombinant human - defensins in controlling Salmonella infection individually and in different stoichiometric combinations . 
The production of recombinant proteins in bacteria has many advantages over other systems ( 26 ) . 
We employed a pET32a expression vector system to express human - defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) as respective thioredoxin A ( TrxA ) - tagged fusion peptides ( TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD-2 ) in Escherichia coli to ( i ) avoid the problems associated with the puriﬁcation of small anti-microbial peptides in prokaryotes and ( ii ) protect the host cell from the toxicity of the expressed defensins . 
We successfully pu-riﬁed functionally active human - defensins and tested their antimicrobial activities individually and in combinations against

E. coli , Staphylococcus aureus , and S. Typhi . 
Furthermore , we determined the efﬁcacies of these active antimicrobial peptides in controlling S. Typhi infection in vivo employing a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection . 
Our present ﬁndings provide strong evidence that bacterium-derived recombinant - defensins can potentially be used to develop an alternative antimicrobial peptide-based approach for controlling Salmonella infections . 
This nascent study describes the production of bioactive defensins heterologously in E. coli and may facilitate future investigations of the antimicrobial properties of these peptides , which , to date , have been prohibitively expensive to obtain .

Mice . 
Originally , BALB/c mice were imported from Jackson Laboratories , Germany , to the National Institute of Immunology ( NII ) , New Delhi , India . 
We obtained mice for our experiments from NII upon formal request . 
Routine breeding and maintenance of the mice were done in the animal facility at the Institute of Life Sciences , Bhubaneswar , India . 
Female BALB/c mice weighing approximately 20 g and 8 weeks of age were used in the present study . 
Approval from the animal ethics committee of the Institute of Life Sciences , Bhubaneswar , was obtained prior to conducting the study . 
Cloning and expression assays of hBD-1 and hBD-2 in E. coli . 
The coding regions for the mature peptides of hBD-1 ( 132 bp ) and hBD-2 ( 132 bp ) were ampliﬁed by PCR from the respective cDNA clones using se-quence-speciﬁc primer pairs ( hBD-1 spFp and hBD-1Rp for hBD-1 and hBD-2 spFp and hBD-2Rp for hBD-2 ; Table 1 ) to generate NcoI at the 5 = end and SacI at the 3 = end and cloned into the corresponding sites of the bacterial expression vector pET32a ( Novagen ) . 
The resulting clones were designated pET32a-hBD-1 and pET32a-hBD-2 , respectively , and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 . 
Single colonies carrying pET32a-hBD-1 and pET32a-hBD-2 constructs were grown separately in 10 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin ( 100 g/ml ) till optical density at 600 nm ( OD ) reached 0.6 . 
Subse-600 quently , the freshly grown bacterial cultures were subcultured into 250 ml LB , grown till the OD600 reached 0.6 , and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG ( isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ) for 6 h . 
After induction , the fusion proteins ( TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD2 ) were puriﬁed using the QIAexpress Ni-NTA Fast Start kit , and the protein proﬁle was analyzed with 15 % SDS-PAGE ( 27 ) . 
The fusion proteins were desalted using an Ultracel YM-3 membrane centrifugal device , and then protein concentrations were measured following the Bradford method ( 28 ) . 
Approximately 
100 g of each protein was subjected to enterokinase digestion ( 1 U/50 g protein ) at 25 °C for 16 h . 
The puriﬁed fusion proteins TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD-2 and the enterokinase-digested proteins ( TrxA hBD-1 and TrxA hBD-2 ) were analyzed using 18 % SDS-PAGE . 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was performed using the digested fusion proteins of hBD-1 ( TrxA hBD-1 ) and hBD-2 ( TrxA hBD-2 ) peptides , separately , according to Vazquez et al. ( 29 ) , employing primary antibodies speciﬁc to hBD-1 and hBD-2 . 
The peptide mixtures , namely , TrxA hBD-1 and TrxA hBD-2 , are designated hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively , herein . 
Aliquots of 10 g of fusion proteins ( TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD-2 ) , hBD-1 , and hBD-2 were resolved on 18 % SDS-PAGE , and separated proteins were transferred onto a 0.2 - m polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membrane for Western blot analysis . 
In vitro antimicrobial assays of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi based on viable cell count method . 
The antibacterial activity assays of bacterium-derived human defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) at different concentrations against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi strains were performed following the protocol described by Krishnakumari et al. ( 30 ) . 
In brief , 50 - l aliquots of freshly 5 grown bacteria ( containing 10 CFU ) were incubated separately with 10 , 20 , 40 , and 60 g each of hBD-1 , hBD-2 , and TrxA ( vector protein control [ VPC ] ) proteins in a 100 - l reaction volume ; the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm for 2 h . 
After incubation , the bacterial mixtures were diluted by 5,000 times , and 100 l of the diluted culture for each reaction was spread on LB agar plates ( in triplicate ) . 
After overnight incubation at 37 °C , the total number of CFU per plate was counted and compared . 
Each assay was performed in triplicate . 
The antimicrobial assays of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 and their combinations in different stoichiometric ratios ( 2:1 and 1:1 ) against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi were carried out following the above-de-scribed method using a total of 60 g of proteins . 
The 2:1 combination comprised 40 g of hBD-1 and 20 g of hBD-2 . 
The 1:1 combination contained 30 g each of the hBD-1 and hBD-2 peptides . 
Antimicrobial assay using the OD600 measurement method . 
The activities of the bacterium-derived defensins against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi were also examined following an OD600 measurement method as described by Ericksen et al. ( 31 ) with modiﬁcations . 
In brief , respective 5 bacterial suspensions ( freshly grown ) containing 10 CFU were incubated with 60 g each of TrxA ( VPC ) , hBD-1 , hBD-2 , hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 2:1 ) , and hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 1:1 ) proteins separately in a ﬁnal 100 - l reaction volume at 37 °C for 2 h at 200 rpm . 
After incubation , a 30 - l aliquot from each reaction mix was inoculated into 1 ml of LB in 3-ml cuvettes in duplicate . 
Cuvettes containing bacteria were incubated at 37 °C at 200 rpm . 
The OD600 of the bacterial cultures was measured at 30-min intervals over the next 5 h of incubation . 
Each assay was performed in triplicate . 
Considering the time point when the OD600 of the control sample reached 0.2 ( threshold ) , the percentages of inhibition for treated samples were calculated ( at that time point ) . 
In vivo antimicrobial activity assay of recombinant defensins in a mouse model of Salmonella infection . 
In vivo , the efﬁcacy of bacterium-derived recombinant human defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) to protect mice from the bacterial challenge was tested in a mouse model of Salmo-nella infection following the protocol of Benincasa et al. ( 32 ) . 
In brief , ﬁve different groups of mice ( 4 animals in each ) were taken , and each mouse in each group was injected intraperitoneally with an inoculum of S. Typhi containing 103 CFU , followed by intraperitoneal administration of recombinant hBD-1 ( 100 g ; group hBD-1 ) , hBD-2 ( 100 g ; group hBD-2 ) , hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 2:1 ) ( 66 g of hBD-1 and 33 g of hBD-2 ; group 2:1 ) , hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 1:1 ) ( 50 g each of hBD-1 and hBD-2 ; group 1:1 ) , and TrxA protein ( 100 g ; group VPC ) . 
Mice in the bacterial control group ( group BC ) were injected with an inoculum of S. Typhi ( 103 CFU ) only , without adding peptides . 
The behavior of each experimental animal in each group was monitored at 6-h intervals until the mouse was euthanized based on the parameters of sickness as described earlier ( 33 ) . 
The time between the administration of bacterial inoculum and euthanization was considered the survival period of that particular mouse . 
Experiments were repeated twice . 
In separate experiments , the number of viable S. Typhi isolates in peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen of infected mice and the liver histopa-thology were evaluated using ﬁve different groups ( group hBD-1 , group hBD-2 , group 2:1 , group 1:1 , and group VPC ) of mice ( n 3 ) . 
Each mouse in each group was injected with an inoculum of S. Typhi ( 103 CFU ) prior to individual administration of the respective recombinant peptides or peptide mixtures , namely , hBD-1 , hBD-2 , hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 2:1 ) , hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 1:1 ) , and TrxA proteins as described above . 
Mice in group BC were injected with an inoculum containing 103 CFU of S. Typhi . 
At 60 h postinfection ( hpi ) , treated mice were euthanized . 
A saline lavage of the peritoneal cavity was performed , and lavage ﬂuid ( 3 to 4 ml ) was collected ; subsequently , liver and spleen were excised , and gross images were captured through a digital camera ( Nikon , India ) . 
Livers from two healthy mice were isolated and photographed as controls . 
The lateral lobe of each liver was sliced , and a half portion of the liver tissue was ﬁxed in 10 % buffered neutral formalin and embedded in parafﬁn . 
The remaining half portions of liver along with spleen and peritoneal ﬂuid were subjected to a CFU count for viable cells on Salmonella-Shigella agar medium following a protocol described earlier ( 32 ) . 
Liver tissues embedded in parafﬁn were sectioned ( 5 m thick ) and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining by a conventional method . 
All the slides were observed under a Leica DM500 light microscope , and representative photographs were taken at 10 and 20 magniﬁcations . 
All the histological evaluations were done in a blinded fashion ( by S.S. ) . 
Statistical analysis . 
All the antimicrobial assay data presented in this article are mean values of three independent experiments and presented with respective standard deviations . 
All the data were also subjected to analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using the GraphPad Prism version 4.0 , and a P value of 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant .

RESULTS Expression analysis of recombinant human defensins in bacte-
ria . 
SDS-PAGE ( 15 % ) analysis of IPTG-induced cell fractions obtained from bacteria ( E. coli strain BL21 ) transformed with pET32a , pET32a-hBD-1 , and pET32a-hBD-2 separately showed that fusion proteins ( TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD-2 ) were localized in the soluble fraction ( data not shown ) . 
Subsequently , the fusion proteins were puriﬁed by a Ni-NTA column and subjected to 18 % SDS-PAGE , as shown in lanes 3 of Fig . 
S1A and B ( for hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively ) in the supplemental material . 
We observed heterologous expression of both hBD-1 and hBD-2 as major bands ( marked by arrows ; see Fig . 
S1A and B in the supplemental material ) , along with some minor protein bands . 
Finally , both TrxA-hBD-1 and TrxA-hBD-2 fusion proteins were desalted and digested with enterokinase , and the products obtained were resolved on an 18 % SDS-PAGE gel . 
Heterologously produced hBD-1 ( see Fig . 
S1A , lane 4 , in the supplemental material ) and hBD-2 ( see Fig . 
S1B , lane 4 ) of approximately 4.5 kDa and the TrxA portion were identiﬁed in a Coomassie blue-stained gel . 
ELISA using defensin-speciﬁc antibodies for hBD-1 and hBD-2 was carried out , and the intensities of color development during ELISA were monitored at OD492 , as described in Materials and Methods . 
The average intensities of color development of three independent experiments for each hBD-1 and hBD-2 recombinant peptide are presented in Fig . 
S1C and D in the supplemental material , respectively , with their respective standard deviations . 
Western blot analysis also established the presence of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 ( see Fig . 
S1E and F , respectively ) in the respective bacterium-puriﬁed proteins . 
No Western blot-positive band was detected from the bacterial lysate obtained from bacteria transformed with the pET32a vector ( data not shown ) . 
Analysis of antibacterial activities of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 , based on CFU count , against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi . 
The antibacterial activities of bacterium-derived defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) were evaluated against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi in the presence of different concentrations of each of the peptides ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 g / l. hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed signiﬁcant antibacterial activities against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi ( Fig. 1A , B , and C ) . 
At 0.6 g / l , hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 66.2 % and 69.6 % inhibition against E. coli ( Fig. 1A ) , 46.5 % and 48.3 % against S. aureus ( Fig. 1B ) , and 69.6 % and 71.9 % against S. Typhi ( Fig. 1C ) , respectively . 
Graph analysis showed that the 50 % lethal doses ( LD50 ) of hBD-1 and hBD-2 against E. coli and S. Typhi were comparable . 
We observed LD values between 0.36 50 and 0.40 g / l for Gram-negative organisms ( E. coli and S. Typhi ) and between 0.66 and 0.69 g / l for the Gram-positive organism ( S. aureus ) . 
The recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 at 0.6 g / l showed approximately 63.1 % and 67.8 % inhibition , respectively , against E. coli in comparison to that obtained from buffer control ( Table 2 ) . 
The 2:1 and 1:1 combinations of hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 91.1 % and 96.2 % killing of bacterial population , respectively , with respect to buffer control . 
Furthermore , we noted the 2:1 ( hBD-1 / hBD-2 ) combination showed 48.2 % and 38.8 % enhanced anti-bacterial activities compared to the individual antimicrobial activities of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
The 1:1 combination showed 56.2 % and 47.0 % enhanced activities over individual usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
Recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed approximately 35.4 % and 33.1 % antibacterial activities against S. aureus ( Gram-positive methicillin-resistant bacteria ) , respectively , in comparison to buf-fer control ( Table 2 ) . 
The 2:1 and 1:1 combinations of hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 54.3 % and 46.6 % antibacterial activities against S. aureus , respectively . 
Moreover , the 2:1 combination showed 64.8 % and 83.7 % enhanced activities , while the 1:1 combination showed 37.3 % and 54.6 % enhanced activities in comparison to individual usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
Heterogeneously expressed hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 52.2 % and 43.3 % antibacterial activities against S. Typhi , respectively , in comparison to that obtained from buffer control ( Table 2 ) , while 2:1 and 1:1 combinations of hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 57.3 % and 80.7 % antibacterial activities against S. Typhi . 
The 2:1 combination showed 12.8 % and 31.7 % enhanced activities compared to that obtained due to individual usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
The 1:1 combination showed signiﬁcantly enhanced antimicrobial activities of 64.9 % and 90.0 % compared to that obtained due to individual usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
TrxA-fused hBD-1 ( TrxA-hBD-1 ) and hBD-2 ( TrxA-hBD-2 ) showed minimal antibacterial activities which were almost identical to those obtained from the buffer control experiments in the above three cases . 
Analysis of antibacterial activities of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 based on OD600 against E. coli , S. aureus , and S. Typhi . 
As an alternate approach , the antibacterial activities of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 were measured with spectroscopic method by recording the growth of bacterial culture in the presence/absence of recombinant peptides at OD600 , as discussed in Materials and Methods . 
Based on the spectroscopic method , recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed approximately 62.8 % and 50.2 % inhibition , respectively , against E. coli compared to buffer control ( Table 2 ) . 
About 72.7 % and 83.0 % killing of bacteria ( E. coli ) were recorded in 2:1 and 1:1 combinations of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , with respect to buffer control . 
Also , the 2:1 combination exhibited 7.2 % and 40.8 % increased activities against E. coli in contrast to the individual activities of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
The 1:1 combination displayed 28.1 % and 69.0 % enhanced activities over the activities of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
Approximately 33.4 % and 37.0 % antibacterial activities against S. aureus ( Gram-positive methicillin-resistant bacteria ) were obtained from bacterium-derived hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively , in comparison to buffer control ( Table 2 ) . 
Recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 in 2:1 and 1:1 stoichiometric ratios displayed 52.2 % and 44.6 % antibacterial activities , respectively , against S. aureus . 
Additionally , the 2:1 combination demonstrated 56.2 % and 41.4 % stronger activities , while the 1:1 combination gave 33.7 % and 20.9 % greater activities in contrast to those with the single usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
Against S. Typhi , heterogeneously expressed hBD-1 and hBD-2 displayed 57.6 % and 50.5 % antibacterial activities , respectively , in comparison to that obtained from buffer control ( Table 2 ) . 
On the other hand , 2:1 and 1:1 combinations of hBD-1 and hBD-2 showed 65.6 % and 80.6 % bactericidal activities , respectively , against S. Typhi . 
The 2:1 combination showed 13.8 % and 32.8 % enhanced activities compared to those obtained due to individual usages of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
The 1:1 combination showed signiﬁcantly enhanced antimicrobial activities of 39.7 % and 60.9 % compared to those obtained due to the individual usage of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively . 
TrxA-fused hBD-1 ( TrxA-hBD-1 ) and hBD-2 ( TrxA-hBD-2 ) showed antibacterial activities which were comparable to those obtained from the buffer control in the above three cases . 
In vivo assay of antimicrobial activity of bacterium-derived hBD-1 and hBD-2 against S. Typhi . 
The in vivo bactericidal activities of bacterium-derived defensins were assayed using a mouse model of Salmonella infection as described in Materials and Methods . 
The behavior of infected mice and the number of survivors were monitored for 10 days ( 240 h ) . 
Within 110 h postinfection ( hpi ) , 100 % mortality was observed among the mice in group bacterial control ( BC ) and group vector protein control ( VPC ; Fig. 2A ) , while no death was observed in mice treated with recombinant defensins either individually or in combination till 110 hpi . 
At 168 hpi , the mortality of mice in group hBD-2 and group 2:1 reached 100 % ; in contrast , 50 % of mice in groups hBD-1 and 1:1 were still alive at this time point ( Fig. 2A ) . 
At 240 hpi ( the point of euthanization ) , 25 % of mice in group hBD-2 and group 1:1 were still alive ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Viable CFU counts of S. Typhi in peritoneal ﬂuids , liver , and spleen of six different groups of experimental mice ( group hBD-1 , group hBD-2 , group 2:1 , group 1:1 , group TrxA , and group BC ) were carried out as described in Materials and Methods , and the data obtained are presented in Fig. 2B . 
We observed 57.2 % , 62.1 % , and 52.8 % inhibitions of viable S. Typhi in peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen , respectively , of mice in group hBD-1 after normalizing the data obtained from bacterial control mice . 
Likewise , we observed 72.8 % , 76.0 % , and 70.7 % reductions in viable S. Typhi in peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen , respectively , of mice in group hBD-2 after normalizing the data obtained from bacterial control mice . 
The mice in group 1:1 showed 80.4 % , 92.1 % , and 81.2 % inhibitions of S. Typhi in peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen , respectively , compared to those of control mice . 
The gross appearance of the liver tissues isolated from all the animals in the BC and VPC groups showed severe necrotic lesions on the surface of the liver at 60 hpi . 
The extent of damage was prominent in all the lobes . 
However , no animal in group 1:1 had any visible deformities on the liver surface at 60 hpi ( see Fig . 
S2A in the supplemental material ) . 
Livers obtained from the mice in group hBD-1 , group hBD-2 , and group 2:1 had a few necrotic spots on certain lobes , but the overall damage was less than the liver damage observed in mice in groups BC and VPC . 
Furthermore , histopathological analysis showed clear necrotic spots/regions in the parenchyma of livers obtained from the mice in group BC and group VPC ( see Fig . 
S2Bii and iii , respectively ) . 
The histology of normal mice and mice injected with hBD-1 / hBD-2 ( 1:1 ) showed no detectable liver damage ( see Fig . 
S2Bi and iv , respectively ) . 
FIG 1 Antibacterial activities of hBD-1 and hBD-2 at different concentrations . 
Percent inhibition data ( with respect to those of the buffer control ) obtained from antimicrobial activity assays using different concentrations of bacterium-derived hBD-1 and hBD-2 against E. coli ( A ) , S. aureus ( B ) , and S. Typhi ( C ) are presented .

FIG 2 In vivo antibacterial activity assays using a mouse model of Salmonella infection . 
( A ) Survival curves of mice infected with S. Typhi ( 103 CFU/mouse ) and treated with bacterium-derived defensin peptides . 
Aliquots of 100 g of bacterium-derived hBD-1 and hBD-2 were used for individual assays . 
The 2:1 combination contained 66 and 33 g of hBD-1 and hBD-2 , respectively , and the 1:1 combination contained 50 g each of hBD-1 and hBD-2 . 
Bacterial control ( BC ) mice were injected with bacteria only , and the vector protein control ( VPC ) mice were treated with TrxA peptides expressed by native vector-transformed cells . 
( B ) Percent reductions in bacterial load in peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen homogenates of infected mice treated with bacterium-derived hBD-1 and hBD-2 individually and in combinations with respect to those of untreated control mice are presented . 
The compositions of proteins used in combination assays are described above .

DISCUSSION
The highly adapted human-speciﬁc pathogen Salmonella Typhi has developed remarkable mechanisms for persistence in its host that help to ensure its survival and transmission ( 34 ) ; this human pathogen is the key cause of typhoid fever . 
Typhoid fever can be treated effectively with antibiotics , such as ﬂuoroquinolone or tet-racyclines , but evidence regarding the development of resistance against antibiotics in S. Typhi evokes serious concerns for controlling salmonellosis in the near future ( 35 , 36 ) . 
In addition , antibiotics are sometimes associated with adverse effects , such as hypersensitivity , immune suppression , and allergic reactions ( 37 ) . 
Therefore , it is necessary to develop new drugs to combat such infectious diseases ( 38 , 39 ) . 
Recently , cationic antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) have become attractive biologics and are drawing increasing interest from both the scientiﬁc community and the pharmaceutical companies for their potential to become alternative therapeutic agents against infectious/critical diseases ( 40 -- 42 ) . 
Studies with different defensins , such as porcine defensin , protegrin-1 , and beetle defensin peptides , indicate that these are less toxic than other antibiotics in experimental animals ( 43 , 44 ) . 
Furthermore , defensins can neutralize bacterial endotoxin by direct binding and inactivation of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 45 ) and by establishing a link between innate and adaptive immune responses during microbial infections . 
Moreover , defensins are critical in controlling HIV-1 ( 46 -- 48 ) , tumor development ( 49 -- 52 ) , renal cell carcinoma , and pros-tate cancer ( 49 , 51 ) . 
Based on these ﬁndings , demand is growing for defensins as important biologics . 
Presently , the commercial production of defensins is insufﬁcient and extremely expensive , preventing the use of defensin-based therapies in the general population . 
Because of the multidimensional biological importance and high cost of defensins , in the present study , we successfully puri-ﬁed functional hBD-1 and hBD-2 from E. coli . 
The puriﬁed defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) were then tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activities either individually or in combination against E. coli ( a common Gram-negative bacterium ) , S. aureus ( a methicillin-resistant Gram-positive bacterium ) , and S. Typhi ( a pathogenic bacterium ) . 
We performed antimicrobial activity assays for heterologous hBDs derived from E. coli , adapting both the conventional spectroscopic method ( based on absorbance of bacterial growth at OD600 ) and the viable CFU count method . 
The antimicrobial activities of the hBDs were comparable , with minor deviations . 
Overall , our ﬁndings indicated that bacterium-derived recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 are biologically functional and have potent antimicrobial activities . 
They showed approximately 50 to 55 % antimicrobial activities against the study bacteria when used individually and 30 to 60 % enhanced activities when used in combination . 
Furthermore , our study demonstrated lower LD50 values of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 against Gram-negative bacteria compared to Gram-positive bacteria , suggesting recombinant defensins are more lethal against Gram-negative bacteria . 
Mortality assays are widely used to study the efﬁciencies of therapeutic molecules against mouse sepsis ( 32 , 53 , 54 ) . 
Accordingly , we tested the efﬁcacies of bacterium-derived recombinant defensins ( hBD-1 and hBD-2 ) in controlling Salmonella infection in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection and found that the administration of these peptides effectively increases the survival time of Salmonella-infected mice , particularly in the 1:1 combination . 
We also observed that these recombinant peptides were effective in decreasing the load of viable S. Typhi in the peritoneal ﬂuid , liver , and spleen of S. Typhi-infected mice . 
Liver section imaging revealed vigorous necrotic lesions in control mice ( group BC and group VPC ) , while relatively less tissue damage was observed in liver sections of defensin-treated mice . 
Interestingly , we found that in the assays of bacterial load and liver pathology , the results of hBD-2 or the 1:1 ( hBD-1 / hBD-2 ) combination showed the greatest efﬁcacy , but in the mouse killing assay , hBD-1 was as effective as the 1:1 ( hBD-1 / hBD-2 ) mixture over hBD-2 . 
This may be due to the fact that the administration of 100 g of recombinant hBD-2 may induce other fatal complications that are independent of bacterial load . 
Moreover , the in vivo therapeutic index along with the nature of folding and the functionality of recombinant hBD-1 and hBD-2 compared to native hBD-1 and hBD-2 need to be investigated to determine their precise efﬁcacies as peptide-based therapies against salmonellosis . 
Based on the ﬁndings of in vitro and in vivo assays , we conclude that the bacterium-derived recombinant defensins hBD-1 and hBD-2 are very effective substances for combating typhoid fever and are likely to become potent therapeutic agents against salmo-nellosis . 
Our study also suggests that the use of recombinant human defensins in combination may become rescue therapy for patients with serious infections with drug-resistant bacteria in the near future .
