ABSTRACT Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serotypes are leading etiological agents of food-borne gastroenteritis . 
Traditional identiﬁcation is laborious and time intensive . 
Faster molecular methods may allow early identiﬁcation in contaminated food products . 
We developed a real-time , ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probe polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay for S. enterica serotypes on the basis of the exclusive presence of the apeE gene in Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Assay sensitivity for 12 S. enterica serotypes was as low as 1.87 × 102 genomic equivalents per milliliter . 
PCR efﬁciency was 94 % and the dynamic range was linear over six orders of magnitude from 100 to 106 copies . 
The lower limit of detection for 12 different food matrices was between 1.5 × 102 and 1.5 × 105 CFU/mL without pre-enrichment . 
When combined with high-throughput automated DNA extraction , 32 food specimens were processed and assayed in less than 2 hours , allowing rapid , speciﬁc , sensitive detection of S. enterica serotypes in food products . 
INTRODUCTION
Salmonellosis remains a leading cause of food-borne illness in the U.S. 1 with an estimated 1.3 million cases , 15,000 hospitalizations , and more than 500 associated deaths annually .2 SalmonellaentericasubspeciesentericaserotypesTyphimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) and Enteriditis are most commonly isolated ; each caused ~ 40 % of all laboratory-diagnosed cases of food-borne salmonellosis in 2006.1 Salmonella Typhimurium has been isolated from a variety of foods including eggs , poultry , dairy products , ground beef , vegetables , and seafood . 
Traditional identiﬁcation of food-borne pathogens is based on laborious techniques such as phenotyping , plate culture using selective and differential media , and biochemical tests . 
Deﬁnitive identiﬁcation can take several days , in which time perishable food products having possible contamination may have been distributed and consumed . 
Faster molecular-based methods of identiﬁcation such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) may therefore enhance the potential for early identiﬁcation , embargo , or recall of contaminated food items . 
Today , numerous rapid ( < 24 hours ) PCR assays exist for food-borne pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens , Escherichia coli , Salmonella species , Campylobacter species , and Staphylococcus aureus .3 FoodpathogenPCRassaysgenerallyrequirepre-enrichment culture of the original sample to grow the target organism to a concentration that the assay can detect ( one organism in 25 g of food product ) .

ysis by adding as much as 24 hours to the overall assay time . 
We developed a real-time PCR assay for Salmonella Typhimurium targeting the gene ( apeE ) that encodes the outer membrane protein N-acetyl phenylalanine b-naphthyl esterase ( ApeE ) .4 The exclusive presence of the apeE gene in Salmonella Typhimurium made it a promising differential PCR assay target for ruling out E. coli or other closely related food-borne pathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae . 
The assay can rapidly , selectively and sensitively screen for Salmonella Typhimurium in food and environmental samples without pre-enrichment , thereby signiﬁcantly cutting analysis time . 
The apeE PCR assay is based on ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) hybridization probes ( hybprobes ) and was developed for use on the Joint Biological Agent Identiﬁcation and Diagnostics System ( JBAIDS ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The JBAIDS is a ruggedized version of the Lightcycler ( LC ) PCR instrument , which combines rapid air thermocycling with simultaneous , ﬂuorescence-based amplicon quantitation in a single reaction capillary tube . 
The JBAIDS is currently used by U.S. military forces to screen food and environmental samples for human pathogens of concern both domestically and under ﬁeld conditions , necessitating rapid detection assays to make timely decisions regarding force protection . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial Strains and Genomic DNA
Puriﬁed bacterial genomic DNA ( gDNA ) and bacterial strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , Rockville , MD ( Table I ) . 
Lyophilized gDNA was reconstituted to a 1-ng/mL working concentration with molecular-grade water . 
S. enterica serotypes used in this study were reconstituted according to ATCC instructions and then propagated overnight aerobically in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) ( Hardy Diagnostics , Santa Maria , CA ) at 37 °C in a shaker incubator ( 200 rpm ) . 
Roche LC Probe Design software 2.0 was used to design oligo-nucleotide primers and FRET hybprobes for ampliﬁcation and detection of Salmonella Typhimurium on the basis of a 231-bp PCR product from the apeE gene ( 1,971 bp ) of Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2 ( GenBank accession no . 
AE006468 ; STM050 ; genome = 4,857,432 bp ; GC content = 52 % ) . 
Primer/probe sequence was conﬁrmed by GenBank BLAST search . 
Primer/probe sets were synthesized by Biosource International ( Camarillo , CA ) as follows : forward primer ( bases 1,413 to 1,428 ) : 5 ′ - ACACTTTCTGTCCGCT-3 ′ ; reverse primer ( complimentary bases 1,643 to 1,627 ) : ′ 5 - CGCATTGATGTACTGGT-3 ′ ; upstream probe ( bases 1,455 to 1,470 ) 5 ′ - AACGCTCGGTGCGCTA-FITC-3 ′ ( T = m 49.4 °C ) ; and downstream probe ( bases 1,473 to 1,488 ) : 5 ′ - RED 640-ACGGGTGGAAGAGGGC-phos-3 ′ ( T = 53.3 °C ) .

Ampliﬁcation and Melting Curve Analysis
All individual 20 mL PCR mixtures were prepared in LC glass capillaries using 5 mL of DNA template sample and 15 mL master mix consisting of primers and FRET hybprobes ( 0.4 mM each ) , 2 units of LC FastStart mix ( consisting of Taq DNA polymerase , UNG , dNTPs , and MgCl ) ( Roche Diagnostics ) , 2 PCR-grade water , and additional MgCl ( to 3 mM ﬁnal con-2 centration ) . 
Thermocycling consisted of an initial hot start at 95 °C for 10 minutes , followed by 45 ampliﬁcation cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 seconds , annealing at 60 °C for 15 seconds , and extension at 72 °C for 5 seconds at a 20 °C / s ramp rate . 
Fluorescence was monitored at 530 and 640 nm through each cycle to verify ampliﬁcation . 
A melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each PCR run as follows : initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 second , annealing at 45 °C with 30-minute hold time , and then heating with a temperature transition ramp rate of 0.1 °C / s from 45 °C to 90 °C in continuous ﬂuorescence acquisition mode .

Assay reaction efﬁciency was determined from the slope of linear portion of the standard curve constructed from log DNA concentrations as a function of respective average C for each DNA concentration , where efﬁciency = 10 − 1/log slope t and an ideal efﬁciency is equal to 2.0 ( i.e. , 100 % efﬁcient ) . 
Precision was determined by calculating the arithmetic mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , and coefﬁcient of variation ( CV ) for the three replicates per each DNA concentration . 
DNA Extraction and Speciﬁcity Determination
Speciﬁcity was determined using extracted DNA from 12 Salmonella species serotypes , assayed in single reactions , and puriﬁed gDNA from 28 nonsalmonellae bacteria assayed in both single and combined PCRs . 
DNA extraction from the 12 Salmonella species serotypes was performed using a fully automated MagNA Pure LC system and DNA Isolation Kit III ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( http://www.roche-applied-science.com/pack-insert/3264785a . 
pdf ) .5 Extracted samples were veriﬁed for DNA concentration and purity by spectrophotometry ( Varian Cary 100 , Varian , Australia ) at 260 and 280 nm and either diluted with molec-ular-grade water or concentrated using a Speed Vac SC110 ( Savant Instruments Inc. , Farmingdale , NY ) to 1 ng/mL total DNA working concentration for PCR . 
All speciﬁcity assays were conducted using 5 ng DNA per PCR . 
Individual PCRs using 28 nonsalmonellae bacteria ( Table I ) were run with the apeE primer and probe set to conﬁrm speci-ﬁcity . 
As well , a combined DNA analysis was performed to verify targeted Salmonella Typhimurium DNA ampliﬁcation in the presence of other nonsalmonellae DNA ( exclusive speci-ﬁcity ) . 
Individual PCRs of extracted Salmonella Typhimurium DNA and gDNA from four nonsalmonellae were prepared using 1 ng DNA per PCR then combined into a LC 100 mL reaction capillary ( 5 ng total bacterial DNA per PCR ) . 
A negative control included on all runs consisted of master mix without template DNA . 
PCR product veriﬁcation was performed by combining 4 mL of amplicon from PCR reactions with 4 mL 20 % ( v/v ) bromophenol blue dye then separated by electro-phoresis ( 2 h , 90 V ) in 2 % ( w/v ) agarose gels prepared with 50 mL 0.5 × TBE Buffer ( pH 8.1 ) and 5mL SYBR Green I nucleic acid stain ( 10,000 × concentration in DMSO , Invitrogen ) . 
A 50-bp ladder ( Invitrogen , Eugene , OR ) was used as a size standard . 
Gels were rinsed in distilled water then visualized at 521 nm using a Kodak 290 Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System . 
Images ( exposure , 8 s ) were captured and processed electronically using Kodak 1D software .

Spiked and Real-World Food Sample Analysis
Twelve selected food products ( Table II ) were individually spiked with Salmonella Typhimurium ( ATCC 700408 ) to evaluate the assay 's lower limit of detection in food . 
Ten grams of solid food product , or 10 mL in the case of milk , were added to 90 mL reagent-grade water in a plastic stomacher bag and blended 2 minutes on high using a Stomacher 80 lab blender ( Seward , London , U.K. ) . 
Nine hundred microliters of lique-ﬁed , nonparticulate food matter were removed from the bag and mixed with 100 mL of Salmonella Typhimurium ( ATCC 700408 ) previously prepared to a 0.5 McFarland standard ( ~ 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL ) . 
From this tube , a serial 10-fold dilution was prepared down to ~ 1.5 CFU/mL using liqueﬁed , nonparticulate food extracted from the bag as the diluent . 
Vortexing between each dilution ensured adequate mixing of food and bacteria . 
Two hundred ﬁfty microliters of each dilution were processed for bacterial DNA extraction using the MagNA Pure LC system and DNA Isolation Kit III ( Roche Diagnostics ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( http://www . 
roche-applied-science . 
com/pack-insert/3264785a . 
pdf ) .5 No pre-enrichment step was performed . 
All assays were performed in triplicate . 
A 250-mL aliquot of each food specimen dilution was also cultured on nutrient agar at 37 °C overnight to conﬁrm CFU counts . 
An aliquot of each nonspiked food product was run as a control in conjunction with spiked foods to ensure no initial Salmonella species were present . 
We also purchased a fresh whole chicken and acquired 38 potpies implicated in a recent food recall to evaluate the assay performance using potentially contaminated real-life food samples . 
The fresh whole chicken was thawed at room temperature for 24 hours to allow maximum possible growth of organisms then 10-g meat samples were removed from 9 locations . 
Samples ( 10 g ) were taken from 16 of the chicken potpies and 22 turkey potpies following complete thawing at room temperature , and 4 , 8 , and 24 hours post-thawing . 
No pre-enrichment step was performed .

Each PCR result was recorded as positive or negative . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Assay Sensitivity, Precision, Efﬁciency, and
Dynamic Range Assay sensitivity , within-run precision , and efﬁciency were established by comparing serial dilutions of puriﬁed Salmo-nella Typhimurium gDNA in triplicate ranging from 5 ng 
( 9.39 × 105 gDNA copies ) to 0.5 fg ( ~ 0.1 gDNA copies ) . 
Copy numbers of the apeE gene per nanogram gDNA were calculated on the basis of the method of Fey et al. ,6 where 1 genome equivalent ( GE ) weighs ~ 5 fg . 
Averaged ampliﬁcation curves from 3 replicates are shown in Figure 2 . 
Under optimal conditions , the apeE assay was capable of detecting as low as 5 fg gDNA per reaction , which equates to 0.939 GE per PCR . 
This is comparable or better than sensitivities reported for other hybprobe-based Salmonella species PCR assays run on realtime instruments where sensitivity analysis was performed ( Table III ) .2,7 -- 11 Assay efﬁciency as a measure of primer and probe design and annealing efﬁcacy , sample inhibition , and assay optimization was very high at 94 % over a range of concentrations from 100 to 106 genomic copies per reaction ( r2 = 0.999 , p < 0.0001 ) ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Assay precision , calculated from the average C of 3 repli-t cates per run and dependent upon the concentration of gDNA per reaction , was highly repeatable with crossing points within 1 ampliﬁcation cycle ( standard deviation ) down to ~ 10 copies per reaction and a low variance < 1 down to ~ 100 copies per reaction ( Table IV ) . 
There was no ampliﬁcation in reactions containing < 1 genomic equivalent . 
This is comparable to the FRET-based Salmonella species assay of Malorney et al. 12 
Assay Speciﬁcity
Positive ampliﬁcation of the target sequence above threshold ( 0.01 ) occurred in all 12 Salmonella species serotypes tested ( Fig. 3 ) , indicating that these serotypes may harbor a comparative gene . 
Salmonella Derby DNA did not amplify in the initial run but did produce a melting peak ( Fig. 4A ) and ampli-ﬁed on a subsequent rerun ( data not shown ) . 
Melting curves were performed at the end of each speciﬁcity run , allowing differentiation and conﬁrmation of amplicon purity . 
Salmonella species serotypes with DNA ampliﬁcation gave a single melting peak ranging from 52.23 to 54.81 °C , corresponding to the T = 53.3 °C of the apeE red 640 probe ( Fig. 4A ) , whereas m nonsalmonellae and negative controls did not produce a melting peak indicative of target ampliﬁcation ( Fig. 4B ) .

Bars are SD of 3 replicates per concentration . 
Five fg DNA per reaction was the lowest quantity giving ﬂuorescence on all three replicates and equates to 0.939 genome equivalent per reaction . 
There was no ampliﬁcation of any replicate at the 0.5 fg concentration level .

The efﬁciency of the assay appears dependent upon the particular serotype . 
Organisms were run at 5 ng gDNA per PCR and we did not determine sensitivity for each serotype , only S. Typhimurium . 
The target speciﬁcity compared well with other hybprobe assays for Salmonella species ( Table III ) . 
The assay was also 100 % speciﬁc to Salmonella species in comparison to 28 nonsalmonellae organisms , including several Enterobacteriaceae , in single reactions ( Fig. 5A ) . 
Only Salmonella Typhimurium demonstrated an ampliﬁcation curve above the established threshold . 
All others were negative . 
The ability of the assay to amplify the apeE target sequence in the presence of nonsalmonellae DNA was demonstrated using combined reactions ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Ampliﬁcation occurred in each complex reaction ( panels 1 -- 7 ) and the positive control ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) but not the negative control . 
To conﬁrm ampli-ﬁcation was speciﬁc to Salmonella species , PCR products from each panel were separated by electrophoresis ( Fig. 6 ) . 
All panels demonstrated a single band between 200 and 250 bp corresponding to the predicted 231-bp apeE product from S. Typhimurium ( positive control ) , indicating that only apeE from Salmonella Typhimurium was ampliﬁed in complex reactions .

Food Analysis Lower Limit of Detection Experiments
Unique to this study was PCR analysis without culture pre-enrichment . 
Most real-time PCR assays for Salmonella species incorporate sample culturing to elevate bacterial counts up to the sensitivity range of the assay . 
This step generally adds from 8 to 24 hours to total analysis time ( Table III ) . 
Our particular approach in this study was driven by its intended use under ﬁeld conditions to screen for inadvertent or intentional food contamination before consumption . 
Food items commonly contaminated with Salmonella species were homogenized with a stomacher and spiked with intact cells of Salmonella Typhimurium ranging from 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL down to ~ 1.5 CFU/mL to evaluate the assay 's lower limit of detection without a pre-enrichment step . 
Averaged ( n = 3 ) crossing points corresponding to the lowest detectable concentration are given in Table II . 
Salmonella Typhimurium was detected in all food matrices at a spiked level of 1.35 × 105 CFU/mL or lower , down to 1,350 CFU/mL for the majority of food products and as low as 135 CFU/mL in red cabbage , equating to ~ 1.875 genomic copies per 20 mL reaction . 
Red cabbage and cilantro contain pigments known to confound PCR analyses incorporating red and green probe ﬂuorophores and may explain increased C values for cilantro .8 Our results t are also in contrast to the PCR assay work of Myint et al. 13 who reported that no Salmonella species could be detected in food samples without pre-enrichment . 
Our assay results compare well with those of Cheung et al. ,14 who were able to detect as low as 1.5 × 103 CFU of Salmonella species per 25 g of rice using a commercially available FRET-based Taqman assay for the LightCycler ; although that assay was not designed for use without pre-enrichment . 
In some food products it was inherently more difﬁcult to sensitively detect DNA , including cheese and milk , which required an initial inoculum of 105 CFU/mL to show positive ampliﬁcation without pre-enrichment . 
The lower limit of detection in eggs was conﬁrmed at 1,350 CFU/mL . 
Because the assay has been shown to optimally detect as little as ~ 1 gDNA copy per reaction , we feel the increase in the lower limit of detection may be associated with less than optimal extraction procedures for the particular food matrix and not necessarily indicative of the assay performance . 
We are currently exploring optimized bacterial and DNA recovery methods to increase assay sensitivity , including ﬁltration and centrifugation as well as mechanical bead lysis . 
This aside , Salmonella Typhimurium was detectable at low concentrations for all food products using this assay even without pre-enrichment . 
This is signiﬁcantly faster than plate culturing techniques , which can require 24 to ≥ 72 hours for deﬁnitive identiﬁcation of Salmonella species . 
No ampliﬁcation was observed in controls ( food products not artiﬁcially inoculated ) . 
The positive predictive value calculated at the 1.35 × 105 CFU/mL concentration was 100 % .

Real-World Samples
Fresh whole chicken samples and recalled turkey and chicken potpies potentially contaminated with Salmonella species were also assayed in comparison to agar plating and broth culture . 
No salmonellae were detected in any sample of the 38 potpies and fresh whole chicken by either of the two detection methods . 
Positive and negative controls functioned correctly . 
The negative predictive value ( NPV ) of the assay for the 38 turkey and chicken potpie samples was 100 % . 
Assay Format
While numerous excellent real-time food assays based on dye or hydrolysis probe ( Taqman ) chemistry have been established for Salmonella species ,12,14 -- 20 our real-time PCR approach was developed using FRET hybridization probes that facilitated high target speciﬁcity and the capability of performing postPCR melting curve analysis to verify speciﬁc amplicon production . 
This is the ﬁrst real-time PCR assay for Salmonella species describing the use of the apeE gene as a target . 
Other hybprobe assays for Salmonella species genes invA , iagA , and sipB/C genes have been described in the literature ( Table IV ) . 
Using real-time PCR , we were able to realize a reduction of the overall assay time through immediate veriﬁcation of amplicon production via concurrent ﬂuorescence analysis , as opposed to traditional thermocycling and end point analysis using postPCR electrophoresis . 
Using this assay we could generally call a sample result positive or negative within 20 -- 30 minutes . 
Our experimental approach also included the use of an automated DNA extraction technique based on magnetic beads that we have used in previous PCR assay develop-21 ment research . 
The MagNA Pure LC system provided rapid , high-throughput extraction of puriﬁed DNA samples from food products ready for PCR analysis . 
High sample purity of ≤ 1.8 was conﬁrmed by spectrophotometry . 
Up to 32 food samples could be simultaneously processed within 1 hour . 
In conjunction with the FRET apeE PCR assay , a rapid overall food contamination analysis time of < 2 hours was consistently achieved . 
This compact system allows for ﬁeld-based , realtime bacterial analysis of food and environmental samples in conjunction with a mobile molecular lab . 
In conclusion , we developed a real-time , FRET-based PCR assay for Salmonella species detection in 12 food matrices and water . 
When combined with an automated DNA extraction method , the assay was performed start to ﬁnish within 2 hours , affording rapid , sensitive , and speciﬁc detection of Salmonella species in food products without pre-enrichment . 
The assay is quantitative ; the number of amplicons can be found by running the assayed sample and the standards in parallel . 
In particular , 
FRET hybprobes appear suitable for rapid PCR analysis by combining increased template speciﬁcity with the capability of postampliﬁcation melting curve analysis . 
Importantly , as opposed to traditional end-point PCR analysis that can take several hours , real-time PCR can give a positive or negative result in as little as 20 minutes . 
While designed for food analysis , this assay may be of potential diagnostic use for the detection of Salmonella species in fecal samples of chronically ill patients and we are currently working to validate the assay clinically in addition to developing an internal ampliﬁcation control . 
This assay holds great promise for food and water safety analyses and may be of particular value to military facilities employing the JBAIDS instrument .
