The metal status of macrophage-phagosomes during Salmonella infection is largely unknown . 
In this study , we have precisely calibrated the metal-speciﬁcities of two metal-responsive promoters , PiroBCDE and PsodB , from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and used these to directly monitor iron-levels in Salmonella-containing macrophage-phagosomes . 
Expression from the PiroBCDE promoter is highly elevated in metal-depleted media but low in media supplemented with iron or cobalt , and to a lesser extent manganese . 
In contrast , PsodB shows low levels of expression in metal-depleted media but is induced in media supplemented with iron but no other metals at maximum permissive concentrations . 
In both cases , iron-responsive expression corresponds to changes in the number of iron atoms per bacterial cell and is unaffected by pH or the presence of reactive oxygen species ( hydrogen peroxide and superoxide ) . 
Importantly , expression from PiroBCDE remained low while expression from PsodB was elevated during infection of both Nramp1þ / þ and Nramp1 / macrophages . 
Expression from a control promoter , PpolA , unaffected by metal ions , remained unchanged . 
These ﬁndings are therefore consistent with the presence of iron within Salmonella-containing macrophage-phagosomes and support a model in which the toxic potential of iron may be exploited as a component of the respiratory burst killing mechanism .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) infections cause serious medical and veterinary problems worldwide resulting in signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality . 
Iron is required by S. Typhimurium as a cofactor for several fundamental enzymes and competition with the host for these ions is considered a key factor for infection [ 1 ] . 
However , when unbound within a cell , redox cycling means iron is extremely toxic , largely due to its ability to catalyze Fenton chemistry generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage biomolecules such as DNA , proteins and lipids . 
The toxic nature of these ions is suggested to be exploited by macrophages constituting a crucial component of the respiratory burst killing mechanism [ 2,3 ] . 
Furthermore , the divalent cation transporter natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 ( Nramp1 , alias SLC11A1 ) is thought to confer resistance to S. Typhimurium by altering metal-levels within bacteria-containing macrophage-phagosomes [ 4 -- 10 ] , although the direction of ﬂux ,

metal substrates in vivo , and precise mechanism of pathogen killing are not known . 
Survival in macrophage-phagosomes is critical for S. Typhimurium virulence [ 11 ] , but what is the nature of the iron stress encountered within these vesicles ? 
In this study , we have precisely calibrated the metal-speciﬁcities of two metal-responsive promoter regions , PiroBCDE and PsodB , from S. Typhimurium and used these to directly monitor iron-levels in both Nramp1þ / þ and Nramp1 / macrophages during Salmonella infection . 
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Calibration of the metal-speciﬁcities of PiroBCDE and PsodB from S. Typhimurium
The products of the iroBCDE operon ( Fig. 1A ) are required for converting the enterobactin siderophore into salmochelin , involved in iron-uptake [ 12 -- 15 ] . 
Expression from PiroBCDE is under the control of the iron-responsive transcription factor Fur and induced by iron-deﬁciency [ 12 ] . 
In contrast , the abundance of sodB transcripts ( Fig. 1B ) , encoding an iron-superoxide dismutase , are substantially reduced in cells depleted of iron due to the action of two anti-sense regulatory small RNAs , rfrA and rfrB , which ar regulated by Fur [ 16 ] . 
To examine iron-responsiveness further , Pir-oBCDE and PsodB were fused to the reporter gene lacZ in vector pRS415 [ 17 ] , introduced into S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 and b-galac-tosidase activity monitored following growth in metal-depleted M9 minimal medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of iron . 
Expression from PiroBCDE was highly elevated in cells grown in minimal medium and substantially reduced following ironsupplementation ( Fig. 1D ) . 
In contrast , expression from PsodB was substantially increased in response to iron , with maximal expression observed at 0.1 mM iron . 
Consistent with previous ﬁndings [ 18 ] expression from a control promoter , PpolA ( Fig. 1C ) encoding DNA polymerase I , was unaffected by iron-levels ( Fig. 1D ) . 
Determination of the iron quotas of chelate-washed S. Typhimurium revealed a substantial increase in iron content upon supplementation of the medium with iron ( Table 1 ) , conﬁrming that altered expression from PiroBCDE and PsodB relates to changes in cytosolic iron-levels . 
In addition to ferrous iron , Fur is known to bind other divalent metal ions in vitro which may also act as effectors in vivo [ 19 -- 21 ] . 
Hence , we examined which , if any , other metals alter expression from PiroBCDE and PsodB . 
In addition to iron , expression from PiroBCDE was reduced in response to maximum permissive concentrations of cobalt and , to a lesser extent , manganese while expression from PsodB was solely responsive to elevated iron-levels ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Supplementation of the M9 minimal medium with the iron chelator diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( DTPA ) did not affect

expression from either promoter consistent with metal-depletion of the medium . 
Expression from the control promoter PpolA was unaffected by any metal ions tested ( Fig. 2A ) . 
To further investigate the response of PiroBCDE to manganese and cobalt , b-galactosidase activity was measured in response to a range of metal concentrations up to inhibitory doses . 
Elevated cobalt-levels caused a similar fold reduction in expression as iron , with essentially full repression observed at 0.5 mM cobalt ( Figs. 1B and 2B ) . 
However , although manganese caused a reduction in PiroBCDE expression , the magnitude of repression remained less at all viable levels of manganese ( Fig. 2B ) . 
These data are consistent with cobalt and manganese , in addition to iron , being able to act as co-repressors of Fur , although the response to manganese is less . 
Similar effects of iron , cobalt and manganese on Fur-mediated regulation of the S. Typhimurium sitABCD operon have been observed [ 21 ] . 
In contrast to PiroBCDE , no viable concentration of cobalt or manganese altered expression from PsodB ( data not shown ) , despite PsodB being regulated by Fur , albeit indirectly . 
Regulation of PiroBCDE by other metal-responsive regulators such as MntR , direct or indirect , can not be excluded .

In order to use PiroBCDE and PsodB to monitor phagosomal ironlevels it is important that their expression is unaffected by other environmental stresses that S. Typhimurium might face inside macrophages . 
Expression from PiroBCDE and PsodB was therefore examined in response to acidic pH and oxidative stress to mimic conditions in the micro-environment of the phagosome . 
Importantly , iron-responsiveness was retained in all cases ( Fig. 3 ) and no substantial change in expression was detected in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide . 
Some reduction in expression was detected as the pH decreased from 7.5 to 4.5 ( Fig. 3C , F and I ) . 
In the case of PiroBCDE , it is possible that this relates to an increase in iron-availability in acid conditions . 
However , a similar decrease in expression was observed for both PsodB and PpolA and was coincident with reduced growth . 
Hence , the inhibitory effects of low pH on expression from these promoters most likely relates to toxicity . 
The ﬁndings above conﬁrm the feasibility of using PiroBCDE with PsodB to report phagosomal iron-levels . 
2.3. Monitoring iron-levels within Salmonella-containing phagsosomes using PiroBCDE and PsodB
S. Typhimurium possessing the lacZ fusion constructs were used to infect RAW264 .7 derived macrophage cell lines 7.5 R and 10S , which are stably transfected with wild-type Nramp1Gly169 or mutant ( functional null ) Nramp1Asp169 alleles , respectively [ 22 ] . 
Intracellular S. Typhimurium were isolated at various time points post-infection , the number of bacteria assessed by viable counts and b-galactosidase activity determined . 
Maintenance of the reporter constructs during this time course and iron-responsive bgalactosidase activity in recovered bacteria was conﬁrmed ( data not shown ) . 
Furthermore , Nramp1 localisation with Salmonellacontaining vesicles in Nramp1þ / þ but not Nramp1 / cells was demonstrated by ﬂuorescence microscopy in parallel infection experiments using RAW264 .7 cells containing EGFP-tagged Nramp1Gly169 or Nramp1Asp169 stably integrated into the chromosome [ 23 ] ( data not shown ) . 
Importantly , PiroBCDE expression remained low in S. Typhimurium isolated from macrophages with and without functional Nramp1 , while expression from PsodB was increased by up to 3.9 - and 3.5-fold in 7.5 R and 10S macrophages , respectively , over the 12-h infection period ( Fig. 4 ) . 
No change in expression from either promoter was observed in bacteri maintained in D-PBS in parallel experiments ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Furthermore , basal expression levels of PpolA remained relatively unchanged throughout the experiment ( Fig. 4 , lower panel ) . 
These data are therefore consistent with iron being available to S. Typhimurium within the phagosomal compartment . 
Wild-type S. Typhimurium may evade the antimicrobial mechanisms of the phagosome by inhibiting maturation of the phago-lysosomal compartment and establishing an intracellular niche , the Salmonella-containing vacuole ( SCV ) , although Nramp1 can counteract this ability [ 24 ] . 
Expression from PiroBCDE and PsodB was therefore also examined during infection of 10S and 7.5 R cells by an attenuated mutant of S. Typhimurium lacking ssaV , required for expression of the SPI-2 type three secretion system involved in establishing the SCV [ 25 ] . 
Similar expression proﬁles for PiroBCDE and PsodB were detected in the ssaV mutant as wild-type S. Typhimurium ( data not shown ) indicating that the presence of iron is independent of SPI-2 . 
In conclusion , the opposing expression proﬁles of PiroBCDE and PsodB in S. Typhimurium during infection of 7.5 R and 10S macro-phages imply the phagosomal compartment is iron-replete and unaffected by Nramp1 function . 
Nramp1 acts as a proton/divalent cation antiporter at late endosomal-phagosomal membranes and has been associated with the transport of iron , manganese , zinc and cobalt using in vitro models [ 5,26 ] . 
However , the actual metals transported during an infection will be dictated by many factors including the availability of individual metal ions , the combined electrochemical gradients of metals and protons , the presence of liganding complexes , changes in oxidative state , and the presence of other metal-transporters . 
It is therefore possible that iron does not serve as a substrate for Nramp1 transport across the phag-osomal membrane of infected macrophages and/or Salmonella may somehow abrogate Nramp1-mediated iron-transport . 
The detection of iron within macrophage-phagosomes supports the ﬁndings of others ; elevated expression of sodB and down regulation of iroDEN transcripts has been reported from a micro-array analysis during intracellular growth of S. Typhimurium in J774-A .1 cells ( Nramp1 / ) [ 27 ] , and while S. Typhimurium mutants lacking the ent gene , encoding enterobactin , are unable to grow in serum lacking iron , they are fully virulent after intraperitoneal infection of mice [ 28 ] . 
Hence , the iron concentration in macrophage-phag-osomes appears to differ from the iron-limited environment reported for SCVs in epithelial cells in which elevated iro gene expression occurs [ 29,30 ] . 
The phagocyte defence against Salmo-nella includes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide by the respiratory burst ( NADPH ) oxidase generating superoxide which is subsequently converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase in the phagosome [ 2 ] . 
In the presence of iron , hydrogen peroxide is consumed in the Fenton reaction producing highly toxic hydroxyl radicals . 
The detection of iron within macrophage-phag-osomes therefore supports a model in which the toxic nature of iron may contribute to the respiratory burst killing mechanism .

Cell culture and macrophage infections 
RAW264 derived macrophage cell lines 7.5 R and 10S , which are stably transfected with wild-type Nramp1Gly169 or mutant ( functional null ) Nramp1Asp169 alleles , respectively [ 22 ] , were maintained in RPMI-1640 ( Sigma , Poole , Dorset , UK ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Invitrogen , Paisley , Scotland , UK ) at 37 C , 5 % CO2 . 
For infection assays , macrophages were seeded into 6 well plates and infected in Dulbecco 's PBS ( D-PBS ; Sigma ) with stationary-phase SL1344 grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM iron or 0.1 mM DTPA ( to switch off expression from PiroBCDE or PsodB , respectively ) at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10:1 ( bacteria : macrophage ) and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g to aid Salmonella uptake ( deﬁned as time 0 h ) . 
After 1 h , D-PBS was replaced with serum-free RPMI-1640 and extracellular bacteria killed using gentamicin ( 100 mg ml 1 ) for 1 h [ 10 ] . 
After this time , the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free RPMI-1640 containing gentamicin ( 10 mg ml 1 ) for the remainder of the experiment . 
At various time points post-infection , cells were washed extensively with D-PBS and intracellular S. Typhimurium released using D-PBS containing 0.2 % Triton X-100 and samples frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C . 
The number of bacteria were assessed by viable counts and b-galacto-sidase activity determined in rapidly thawed samples using the ﬂuorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferone ß-D-galactopyrano-side and ﬂuorescence measured on a ﬂuorescence microplate reader ( Synergy-HT , Bio-Tek Instruments ) with excitation ﬁlter at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm ( 40 nm bandwidth ) . 
Extracellular bacteria were maintained in D-PBS in parallel experiments and b-galactosi-dase activity measured at the same time points post-infection .
