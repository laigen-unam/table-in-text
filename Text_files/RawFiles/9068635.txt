The Salmonella typhimurium pepT gene is induced nearly 30-fold in response to anaerobiosis . 
Anaerobic expression is dependent on the transcriptional regulator encoded by fnr ( previously oxrA ) . 
Primer extension analysis and site-directed mutagenesis experiments show that pepT is transcribed from two s70 promoters . 
One promoter ( P1 ) is FNR dependent and anaerobically induced , while the other ( P2 ) appears to be constitutive . 
The potABCD operon is divergently transcribed from a promoter near pepT P2 . 
Sequence analysis of pepT promoter mutations which either elevate anaerobic expression or confer constitutive expression revealed that these mutations affect the 210 region of the P1 or P2 promoter , respectively . 
The pepT200 mutation , which changes the 210 region of the FNR-dependent P1 promoter to the consensus , has the surprising effect of allowing ﬁve - to sevenfold anaerobic induction in the absence of FNR . 
We have shown that the anaerobic induction of pepT-lacZ in a pepT200 fnr strain is dependent on wild-type alleles of both crp and cya . 
In a pepT200 pepT-lacZ strain , b-galactosidase activity was elevated aerobically in the presence of exogenous cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) and was elevated also in succinate minimal medium relative to its level in glucose minimal medium . 
Primer extension analysis conﬁrmed that P1 is the cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) - dependent promoter . 
Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that a hybrid CRP-FNR binding site positioned at 241 of the P1 promoter is utilized by both FNR and CRP . 
CRP-cAMP also appeared to repress FNR-dependent transcription of pepT under anaerobic conditions in both the pepT1 and pepT200 backgrounds . 
Although both CRP and FNR are capable of binding the hybrid site and activating transcription of pepT , CRP requires the consensus 210 sequence for efﬁcient activation . 
The Salmonella typhimurium pepT gene encodes an ami-notripeptidase which cleaves the N-terminal amino acid from a variety of tripeptides ( 42 ) . 
Expression of pepT is induced nearly 30-fold by growth under anaerobic conditions . 
Anaerobic induction requires the positive regulator encoded by the fnr ( previously oxrA ) gene ( 21 , 41 ) . 
FNR is a transcription factor which is required for the expression of a number of anaerobically induced genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella ( 39 , 41 ) . 
Most FNR-dependent genes encode proteins involved in an-aerobic respiratory pathways ( 39 , 41 ) . 
FNR appears to be structurally and functionally similar to the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein ( CRP ) , a transcriptional activator which regulates transcription of target genes in response to carbon source availability ( 25 , 39 ) . 
Both FNR and CRP activate transcription by binding to well-deﬁned palindromic DNA sequences frequently located at approximately 241 bp relative to the start of transcription . 
The similarity between FNR and CRP extends to their 22-bp consensus DNA binding sites , which differ at only one highly conserved position in each half site ( 39 ) . 
Sequence analysis of the pepT promoter region ( 31 ) revealed two putative promoters in the region upstream of the start of the translation . 
One promoter ( P1 ) contains a sequence similar

to the FNR consensus site at 241 bp from a predicted transcriptional start site , suggesting that this promoter is responsible for the FNR-dependent induction of pepT under anaerobic conditions . 
Another promoter ( P2 ) located upstream of the FNR site was predicted to be constitutive and responsible for the low level of aerobic expression of pepT . 
In addition , a divergently transcribed operon , potABCD , has been identiﬁed ( 29 ) . 
The putative promoter for this operon lies upstream of the pepT P2 promoter ( 15 ) . 
In this study , we have characterized the promoter region of pepT . 
We have conﬁrmed the existence of the predicted pepT and potABCD promoters and examined the effects of several pepT promoter mutations . 
During the course of this work , it became apparent that a promoter mutation ( pepT200 ) which creates a consensus 210 sequence in the P1 promoter results in FNR-independent anaerobic induction of pepT . 
We have shown that this anaerobic expression is due to CRP-cAMP acting at the FNR site of the pepT P1 promoter . 
Our results indicate FNR and CRP recognize the same binding sites in the pepT promoter . 
In the wild-type promoter ( ﬁve of six bases match those of the consensus 210 sequence ) , only FNR can activate transcription . 
In a promoter identical except for a single base change creating a consensus 210 sequence , CRP becomes an efﬁcient activator of transcription .

Media and growth conditions . 
E medium ( 44 ) supplemented with 0.4 % glucose and NCE medium ( 7 ) supplemented with 0.6 % succinate were used as minimal media . 
Minimal media were supplemented with either 0.1 % Casamino Acids ( Difco ) or the 20 common amino acids at standard concentrations ( 7 ) . 
Luria broth ( Gibco BRL ) was used as a rich medium . 
MacConkey agar base ( Difco ) was supplemented with 0.1 % lactose ( Difco ) . 
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations ( micrograms per milliliter ) : ampicillin , 50 ( solid media ) or 100 ( liquid media ) ; kanamycin , 50 ; tetracycline , 25 ; and spectinomycin , 100 . 
cAMP was added to growth medium where indicated at a concentration of 5 mM . 
All incubations were at 378C . 
Cultures were grown for b-galactosidase assays as follows . 
Aerobic conditions were achieved by vigorous shaking . 
Anaerobic cultures were either sparged in ﬂasks with 5 % CO -- 95 % N or grown in 2 2 Balch anaerobic tubes ( 1 ) . 
Balch tubes were used for anaerobic growth of crp ( or cya ) fnr double mutant strains which had doubling times of greater than 3 h . 
A representative set of pepT-lacZ fusion strains was assayed for b-galactosidase after growth in Balch tubes , and results were similar to those obtained after growth in sparged ﬂasks , indicating that there is no apparent difference in the extent of pepT induction under these two conditions ( data not shown ) . 
DNA manipulations . 
DNA manipulations were performed by using standard techniques ( 30 ) . 
Fragments for subcloning were isolated and ligated in low-melting-temperature agarose ( GTG SeaPlaque ; FMC Bioproducts ) or puriﬁed from agarose by using a GeneClean II kit ( Bio 101 ) . 
Restriction enzymes were obtained from Gibco BRL or New England Biolabs . 
T4 DNA ligase and other enzymes were obtained from Gibco BRL . 
DNA sequencing was performed by using Sequenase version 2.0 ( U.S. Biochemicals ) . 
PCR and sequencing of chromosomal alleles by using a PCR-generated template were performed as previously described ( 28 ) . 
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method of Deng and Nickoloff ( 8 ) , using a Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit as instructed by the manufacturer ( Clontech ) . 
A 377-bp fragment containing the pepT promoter region was PCR ampliﬁed by using primers pepT10 ( 59AGCCTAGGATGCAG TCACCCTCACTT ) and pepT4 ( 59CAATCAGGCGAAGAACGG ) and cloned into pTZ18U ( Bio-Rad ) as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment to create pCM241 , which was used as the template in site-directed mutagenesis . 
Mutagenic primers were used to change the FNR site of the P1 promoter to an FF , CC , or FC site ( 4 ) as shown in Fig. 1 . 
Mutagenic primers were also used to change 210 and 235 regions , creating the pepT206-pepT208 mutations as indicated in Fig. 3 . 
All mutations were veriﬁed by sequencing . 
Subsequently , EcoRI-BamHI mutant pepT promoter-containing fragments were moved from pCM241 to EcoRI-BamHI-cut pRS551 ( 34 ) to create pepT-lacZ transcriptional fusions . 
As a result of a primer design error , these fusions all carry an additional 19 bp of sequence from pTZ18U between the pepT promoter and the BamHI site . 
Speciﬁcally , bp 387 of the pepT promoter is followed by CCTAGGCT ( primer pepT10 ) , then CGACTCTAGA ( pTZ18U ) , and then the BamHI site of pRS551 . 
b-Galactosidase assays . 
b-Galactosidase activity was measured by the method of Miller ( 32 ) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-chloroform-permeabilized cells . 
Singlecolony overnight cultures were diluted ( 1:100 or 1:250 ) into fresh medium and grown to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.2 to 0.3 aerobically or anaerobically as described above . 
Results are given in Miller units and represent duplicate assays on at least three independent cultures . 
Standard deviations were 10 % or less unless otherwise noted . 
Isolation of pepT200 . 
The pepT200 mutation was isolated in a screen for mutations which restored anaerobic induction of pepT-lacZ in an rpoA8 mutant background . 
A wild-type pepT-lacZ fusion strain forms a ﬁsheye colony on MacConkey lactose medium ( colony with a well-deﬁned red center and white periphery ) , and the rpoA8 mutation results in a pink colony phenotype ( 28 , 41 ) . 
The rpoA8 strain TN2758 was mutagenized with diethyl sulfate ( 32 ) and plated on MacConkey lactose medium . 
The pepT200 mutation was identiﬁed as a mutation linked to pepT : : MudJ which resulted in a red phenotype . 
Sequence analysis of S. typhimurium fnr and construction of an fnr deletion strain . 
The nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium fnr ( oxrA ; GenBank accession number U05668 ) was determined by subcloning and sequence analysis of the oxrA1 plasmid pJG100 . 
The predicted protein is 98.5 % identical to E. coli FNR . 
Sequence analysis of the Tn10 insertion site in the fnr-2 : : Tn10 strain TN2336 shows that the Tn10 disrupts the coding region of fnr at amino acid 30 ( data not shown ) . 
An fnr deletion was generated from the fnr-2 : : Tn10 strain TN2806 by selection for sensitivity to tetracycline ( 5 ) . 
The resulting tetracyclinesensitive strain ( TN3848 ) was conﬁrmed to carry a deletion of fnr by PCR and Southern blot analysis ( data not shown ) , and this fnr allele was designated Dfnr-46 . 
Construction of single-copy lacZ fusions . 
To study mutant pepT promoters in single copy , mutant pepT-lacZ fusions were returned to the chromosome via homology between plasmids carrying pepT-lacZ fusions and a chromosomal insertion in the trp operon containing a promoterless lac fusion . 
These plasmids and their use in making single-copy constructs are detailed below . 
Chromosomal insertions in trp were made by using pCM184 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
This plasmid contains unique BamHI and SmaI sites and a selectable marker encoding resistance to spectinomycin , all ﬂanked by sequences from the trp operon of S. typhimurium . 
DNA sequences cloned into the unique sites can be introduced into the chromosome by homologous recombination between plasmid and chromosomal trp sequences . 
The recombination event is forced by introducing the plasmid into a polA strain in which it can not replicate ( 18 ) , selecting for spectinomycin resistance ( Spcr ) . 
This construct has been used to place a number of genes and lac fusions into the Salmonella chromosome and should be generally useful for making single-copy constructions . 
pCM184 was constructed from pSTH29 as follows . 
pSTH29 contains the trp operon of S. typhimurium ( 1a ) . 
A unique StuI site in trpB was converted to a BamHI site by using BamHI linkers ( New England Biolabs ) . 
An internal BamHIClaI fragment of the trp operon including trpC and some ﬂanking sequence of trpB and trpD was then removed and replaced with a 2.3-kb BamHI-ClaI fragment containing the Spcr gene from pDPT427 ( 35 ) . 
The 2.3-kb Spcr fragment of pDPT427 was isolated as a BamHI-HindIII fragment and cloned into

BamHI-HindIII-digested pBR322 . 
The Spcr fragment was then isolated from this plasmid by using BamHI and ClaI . 
To create a target for recombining lacZ promoter fusions into the chromosome , we made use of pCM257 , a derivative of pCM184 which contains the promoterless lacZYA9 operon preceded by tandem rrnB transcriptional terminators from the lac transcriptional fusion vector pRS551 ( 34 ) . 
To construct pCM257 , the 6.6-kb HindIII-StuI fragment of pRS551 ( carrying the promoterless lacZYA9 ) was treated with Klenow enzyme . 
BglII linkers were added , and the fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pCM234 , creating pCM257 . 
pCM234 is a derivative of pCM184 in which the EcoRI site was removed by EcoRI digestion followed by Klenow enzyme treatment and religation . 
A chromosomal insertion element was generated from pCM257 as follows . 
pCM257 was transduced into polA ( 18 ) strain TN2373 , selecting for Spcr . 
Transductants were screened for sensitivity to ampicillin and tryptophan auxotrophy , indicating that lacZYA9 and Spcr had been inserted into the trp operon by homologous recombination . 
One such transductant was saved as TN4560 . 
The mutation generated in trp was designated trp-191 : : RTC1 ( named RTC for return to chromosome element ) . 
The element was transduced into a wild-type background ( TN1379 ) , selecting for Spcr , to give TN4565 . 
The RTC1 element can be easily used to place lac fusions in the chromosome in single copy . 
In these studies pepT promoters were cloned as 0.38-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragments into EcoRI-BamHI-digested pRS551 ( 34 ) , creating pepT-lacZ transcriptional fusions . 
The resulting plasmids were introduced into TN4565 , selecting for ampicillin resistance . 
P22-transducing lysates prepared on such r plasmid-carrying strains were used to transduce TN1379 , selecting for Spc conferred by the RTC1 element and screening for Lac1 ( ﬁsheye or red ) on MacConkey lactose plates . 
Normally TN4565 has a pink/white phenotype on MacConkey plates . 
Fisheye or red transductants typically appear at a frequency of approximately 0.5 % . 
Presumably these transductants arise from rare homog-enotes formed in the donor in which the pepT-lacZ fusion on the plasmid has recombined into the chromosome by homology with the chromosomal RTC1 element . 
The pepT-lacZ chromosomal fusions ( RTC2 to RTC14 ) in strains TN4571 , TN4610 , TN4612 , TN4630 , TN4839 , TN4840 , TN4841 , TN4729 , TN4921 , TN4922 , and TN4923 were constructed in this way . 
Ampicillin sensitivity and tryptophan auxotrophy were conﬁrmed in each case . 
Chromosomal promoter sequences were veriﬁed by sequencing of PCR-generated DNA . 
RNA isolation . 
Strains were grown either in E minimal glucose medium with Casamino Acids or in NCE succinate medium supplemented with 20 amino acids . 
Cultures ( 100 ml ) were grown at 378C aerobically or anaerobically as described above to an OD600 of 0.28 6 0.01 , at which point they were immediately chilled by being poured into centrifuge bottles ﬁlled with ice and centri-fuged . 
Immediate chilling was critical for isolation of RNA from aerobic cultures . 
When aerobic culture ﬂasks were merely placed on ice for 5 to 10 min prior to harvesting , transcripts normally present only in anaerobic cultures were observed in primer extension experiments . 
RNA was prepared as described by Gerendasy and Ito ( 16 ) except that phenol was equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) . 
RNA was resuspended in 100 to 300 ml of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O and stored at 2708C . 
An aliquot of each RNA preparation was electrophoresed on formaldehyde agarose gels ( 30 ) in order to verify that no detectable RNA degradation had occurred during isolation . 
Primer extension analysis . 
The sequence of the pepT-speciﬁc primer ( pepT7 ) was 59 CGCTCAAGTAGTTTATCCATGCAGT ; that of the potABCD-speciﬁc primer ( pot1 ) was 59 CGCGGTTGATTATTCAATTTCTTACTCTGTCCCA . 
Five micrograms of RNA and approximately 105 cpm of 32P-end-labeled primer were annealed in a total volume of 10 ml containing 250 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.3 ) by heating at 958C for 5 min , followed by 658C for 15 min . 
Samples were then chilled on ice and spun brieﬂy before addition of 10 ml of a master mix containing 48 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.8 ) , 16 mM dithiothreitol , 32 mM MgCl2 , 0.8 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate , 0.1 mg of actinomycin D per ml , and 2 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Life Sciences , Inc. ) per ml . 
Reaction mixtures were incubated at 558C for 1 h and then precipitated on dry ice after addition of 180 ml of solution A ( 250 mM sodium acetate , 20 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 7.4 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 0.25 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) and 3 vol of ethanol . 
Pellets were washed in 70 % ethanol , air dried , and suspended in 3 ml of H2O ; then 2 ml of formamide loading solution ( 95 % formamide , 20 mM EDTA , 0.05 % bromophenol blue , 0.05 % xylene cyanol FF ) was added . 
Samples were heated to 958C for 2 min and loaded on an 8 % sequencing gel along with reaction mixtures from sequencing reactions using the same labeled primer . 
The 1 pepT plasmid pCM165 was used as the template for sequencing reactions . 
FIG. 2 . 
pCM184 ( vector used for construction of chromosomal insertions in S. typhimurium ) . 
All restriction sites shown are unique . 
The gene of interest may be inserted in the BamHI or SmaI sites . 
A variant of this plasmid ( pCM257 ) carrying a promoterless E. coli lac operon ( from pRS551 [ 34 ] ) inserted in the BamHI site was used to create a trp : : lac insertion in the S. typhimurium chromosome ( trp-191 : : RTC1 ; TN4565 ) . 
Recombination between this chromosomal insertion and pRS551 derivatives carrying mutant pepT-lacZ fusions allowed facile introduction of site-directed promoter variants into the chromosome in single copy . 
RESULTS
Characterization of pepT promoter mutants . 
Two classes of pepT promoter mutants have been isolated . 
One class has 30-fold elevated constitutive ( aerobic ) levels of pepT expression . 
These mutants were isolated in a selection for overproduction of peptidase T under aerobic conditions and were originally designated pto2 to pto9 ( 40 ) . 
They have been renamed pepT212 to pepT219 . 
The second class consists of a single mutant , pepT200 , in which the anaerobic level of pep expression is increased . 
pepT200 was isolated in a screen for mutations which could restore anaerobic induction of pepTlacZ in a strain carrying rpoA8 , a mutation in the gene encoding the a subunit of RNA polymerase ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
Certain mutations in the a subunit can cause defects in anaerobic expression of pepT and other FNR-depen-dent genes , presumably because they disrupt an interaction between FNR and RNA polymerase which is important for activation ( 28 ) . 
The pepT200 mutation results in a 3.6-fold elevation in anaerobic expression of pepT-lacZ compared to pepT1 ( Table 2 ) . 
The results in Table 2 also show that although anaerobic induction in the pepT1 background is completely dependent on FNR , there is still a sevenfold anaerobic induction in the pepT200 fnr background . 
This unexpected result will be discussed below . 
The pepT promoter regions from pepT212-pepT219 and pepT200 mutant strains were ampliﬁed from the chromosome by using PCR and sequenced . 
The pepT212-pepT219 and pepT promoters each show the same mutation converting the 210 region of the putative P2 promoter ( TATAGT ) to match the 210 consensus sequence for E. coli s70 promoters ( TATAAT ) ( 19 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The pepT200 promoter region has a single nucleotide substitution changing the 210 region of the putative FNR-dependent promoter P1 ( AATAAT ) to match the 210 consensus sequence . 
These mutations are consistent with the phenotypes of these strains in that the 210 consensus would be predicted to enhance the activity of these promoters , resulting in elevated pepT expression under aerobic conditions for pepT212-pepT219 strains and under anaerobic conditions for pepT200 strains . 
Thus , these mutations provide strong evidence for the existence of the two pepT promoters proposed based on sequence analysis ( 31 ) , an upstream apparently constitutive promoter ( P2 ) , and a downstream FNR-dependent , anaerobically induced promoter ( P1 ) . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of P1 and P2 . 
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the putative 210 and 235 sequences of the P1 and P2 promoters so that they no longer resembled the consensus 210 and 235 sequences . 
The alterations to P1 ( pepT206 ) and P2 ( pepT207 and pepT208 ) are shown in Fig. 3 . 
The mutant promoter constructs were cloned in a lacZ fusion vector and returned to the chromosome in single copy as described in Materials and Methods . 
The effects of these mutations on b-galactosidase expression are shown in Table 3 . 
The mutation affecting the 210 region of the P1 promoter ( pepT206 ) abolished anaerobic induction of pepT as expected . 
The mutations affecting the 210 and 235 sequences of P2 ( pepT207 and pepT208 ) reduced the aerobic ( basal ) level of pepT expression without affecting the anaerobic level . 
The effect of pepT207 and pepT208 is most apparent in a comparison of the fnr strains , where aerobic expression is reduced a Values represent duplicate assays on at least three independent cultures . 
Strains were grown in minimal glucose medium supplemented with 20 amino acids . 
Cultures were inoculated 1:250 from overnight cultures . 
b All carry pepT-lacZ constructs as insertions in trp as described in Materials and Methods . 
c Due to variability in assay results with this strain , the value was obtained by determining the DOD420/Dtime over six time points . 
The slope was calculated and used to determine activity . 
d In this set of assays , the aerobic fnr1 pepT207 and pepT208 values are two-to threefold higher than the aerobic values for the corresponding fnr strains . 
In other assays ( data not shown ) , 1 or 2 U was obtained for the fnr1 pepT207 and pepT208 strains . 
We believe that this difference reﬂects the variability in returning to a very low steady-state level after dilution from the overnight stationary-phase culture , which has a high level of b-galactosidase activity ( ca. 400 U ) approximately ﬁvefold relative to that of the pepT1 promoter strain ( see footnote d to Table 3 ) . 
These results provide additional evidence for the roles of the P1 and P2 promoters in basal and anaerobically induced pepT expression . 
Identiﬁcation of pepT transcription start sites . 
Primer extension analysis was performed to conﬁrm the predicted transcription start sites for P1 and P2 . 
RNA was isolated from wild-type ( TN2262 ) , fnr ( TN2336 ) , pepT200 ( TN2782 ) , and fnr pepT200 ( TN2783 ) strains grown anaerobically or aerobically . 
Primer extension results are shown in Fig. 4 . 
In the wild-type background , there are two sets of extension products corresponding to the start sites predicted for P1 and P2 . 
Transcription from the P1 promoter is dependent on anaerobic growth conditions and on the fnr gene product as expected ( Fig. 4 , lanes 1 to 4 ) . 
The minor P1 product may represent a minor fnr-dependent start site or a degradation product of the major transcript . 
The level of the P2 transcript appears unaffected by anaerobiosis or by the fnr mutation . 
The pepT200 mutation results in increased transcription from P1 ( lane 5 ) , and this transcription is strongly dependent on FNR ( lane 6 ) . 
Primer extensions carried out with RNA isolated from a pepT212 strain ( TN2771 ) conﬁrm that pepT212 increases transcription from P2 but does not affect transcription from P1 ( data not shown ) .

Identiﬁcation of a divergently transcribed promoter for potABCD . 
The potABCD operon , which encodes a transport system for putrescine and spermidine ( 15 , 24 ) , is divergently transcribed from pepT ( 29 ) . 
A putative promoter for this operon had been predicted by sequence analysis ( 15 ) . 
Because divergently transcribed genes are often coordinately regulated ( 2 ) , we were interested in conﬁrming the potABCD start site and testing whether potABCD expression might be regulated by anaerobiosis . 
Primer extensions were performed on RNA isolated from a wild-type strain ( TN2262 ) grown aerobically or anaerobically , using a potABCD-speciﬁc primer . 
Figure 5 shows that there are two major extension products which correspond to the start site of the promoter proposed by Furuchi et al. ( 15 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
There seems to be little effect of anaerobi-osis on the level of potABCD transcription . 
The pepT200 mutation results in FNR-independent anaerobic expression of pepT . 
While the anaerobic induction of the wild-type pepT promoter is completely dependent on fnr , the pepT200 mutation results in a sevenfold anaerobic induction of pepT-lacZ in an fnr mutant strain ( Table 2 ) . 
One possibility that we considered to explain this FNR-independent expression is that the fnr-2 : : Tn10 insertion is not actually a null mutation but rather encodes a partially active FNR which might be able to activate pepT transcription if the 210 region is consensus . 
This possibility was excluded in two ways . 
First , the site of Tn10 insertion into fnr was determined by DNA sequencing and shown to interrupt the coding region at a site 30 codons downstream from the AUG encoding the N terminus of the protein , presumably resulting in a null mutation . 
Second , a strain carrying a deletion of fnr ( TN3848 ) was constructed . 
Strains carrying this deletion give the same result as fnr-2 : : Tn10 strains with regard to pepT200 pepT-lacZ expression ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , FNR can not be involved in this phenomenon and some other regulatory element must be responsible for FNR-independent anaerobic induction . 
CRP-cAMP is responsible for the anaerobic induction of pepT-lacZ in a pepT200 fnr background . 
For a number of reasons , we suspected that the anaerobic induction observed in a pepT200 fnr background might involve CRP-cAMP ( see Discussion ) . 
To explore this possibility , the effects of crp and cya mutations on the anaerobic expression of pepT-lacZ were determined . 
Anaerobic induction in a pepT200 fnr strain is clearly dependent on CRP and cAMP , as crp fnr and cya fnr double mutants show no anaerobic induction ( Table 4 ) . 
Surprisingly , the crp and cya mutations increase ( two - to threefold ) anaerobic b-galactosidase levels in the fnr1 strains , in both the pepT1 and pepT200 backgrounds , relative to crp1 and cya1 strains . 
These results suggest that CRP-cAMP can act as a repressor of FNR-dependent transcription in both the pepT1 and pepT200 fnr1 backgrounds . 
Presumably , the CRP-dependent anaerobic induction o a Values represent duplicate assays on at least three independent cultures .

b Grown in Balch tubes as described in Materials and Methods . 
pepT200 pepT-lacZ reﬂects the increase in the level of cAMP in cells growing anaerobically in glucose minimal media ( 43 ) . 
We predicted that the level of aerobic expression of pepT should be elevated under conditions that lead to increased cAMP levels . 
Table 5 shows that aerobic growth in glucose minimal medium with cAMP or in succinate minimal medium results in 7 - to 15-fold increased expression of pepT200 pepT-lacZ . 
The cAMP effect is dependent on a wild-type allele of crp . 
The consensus 210 sequence appears to be required for CRP activation of pepT , as growth under similar conditions had no effect on expression on pepT1 pepT-lacZ strains ( data not shown ) . 
Identiﬁcation of the CRP-dependent transcription start site . 
The FNR site at 241 of the P1 promoter is actually a hybrid CRP-FNR site ( CF site [ 4 ] ; see Discussion and Fig. 1 ) in that the left half site more closely resembles the CRP consensus half site than the FNR consensus half site . 
It seemed likely that CRP-cAMP acts through the CF site to activate transcription of the P1 promoter in a pepT200 strain . 
Primer extension experiments ( Fig. 4 ) show that the pepT200 mutation does indeed result in FNR-independent transcription from P1 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) . 
To provide further evidence that P1 is the CRP-dependent promoter , primer extensions were performed on RNA isolated from a pepT200 fnr strain ( TN2783 ) grown in minimal glucose medium anaerobically or aerobically with or without exogenous cAMP and also aerobically in minimal succinate medium . 
The results ( Fig. 6 ) show that anaerobic growth conditions ( lane 1 compared with lane 3 ) , exogenous cAMP ( lanes 2 and 4 compared with lanes 1 and 3 ) , and growth a Values represent duplicate assays on at least three independent cultures .

in succinate ( lane 3 compared with lane 5 ) all lead to elevated levels of the P1 transcript . 
Transcription from the P2 promoter appeared unaffected under these growth conditions ( data not shown ) . 
We conclude that the P1 promoter mediates both FNR-dependent and CRP-dependent transcription . 
Effects of alterations in the hybrid site on expression of pepT . 
The results described above suggest strongly that FNR activates transcription by binding to the CF site at 241 of the P1 promoter . 
CRP can also bind this site but can activate transcription only in the context of a consensus 210 sequence . 
To further test these proposals , site-directed mutagenesis was used to change positions 5 and 18 of the 22-bp CF site to match either the FNR or the CRP consensus site , yielding the FF , FC , and CC derivatives shown in Fig. 1 . 
The mutant promoters were cloned into a lacZ fusion vector and placed in the chromosome in single copy ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
The ability of each of the mutant sites to mediate FNR or CRP-dependent activation was determined by assaying b-galactosidase activity in cells grown under conditions which induce either FNR-dependent expression ( anaerobiosis ) or CRP-dependent expression ( growth in succinate ) . 
Table 6 shows the results of these experiments for strains carrying the wild-type ( nonconsensus ) 210 sequence . 
Each binding site allows FNR-dependent anaerobic induction . 
As expected , the abilities of the sites to mediate activation ( CC , FC 5 CF , FF ) correspond to increasing similarities to the FNR consensus site . 
A similar trend in anaerobic expression was seen with constructs carrying the consensus 210 sequence in combination with each activator site ( data not shown ) . 
These results provide direct evidence that the CF site is the site of FNR action at the P1 promoter . 
None of the sites allows CRP-dependent activation of P1 . 
Even the CC site is fully dependent on FNR for anaerobic induction . 
The FF site confers elevated FNR-dependent aerobic expression , suggesting that aerobic cells might contain a low level of active FNR . 
Similar effects have been seen in studies of other FNR-depen-dent promoters when the FNR site is changed toward the consensus ( 27 ) . 
Except for the FF strains , there is a small but reproducible increase in FNR-dependent expression in crp mutants compared to the wild type . 
This effect was also seen wit a Values represent duplicate assays on at least three independent cultures .

the pepT : : MudJ fusions ( Table 4 ) , and as mentioned previously , we suggest that CRP acts to repress the FNR-dependent anaerobic induction in these strains . 
Table 7 shows the effects of binding site mutations on CRP-dependent expression in strains carrying the consensus ( pepT200 ) 210 sequence . 
Transcription from each construct is induced by growth in succinate relative to growth in glucose but only when the 210 site has the consensus rather than the wild-type ( nonconsensus ) sequence . 
The level of activation increases with increasing similarity to the CRP consensus site ( FF , CF 5 FC , CC ) . 
We conclude that CRP binds to the CF site at 241 to activate transcription of the pepT200 P1 promoter .

DISCUSSION
The work described here demonstrates that pepT is transcribed from two promoters . 
One ( P1 ) is activated by anaerobiosis and requires the activator FNR . 
The other ( P2 ) is located upstream of P1 , appears to be constitutive , and is unaffected by anaerobiosis . 
Primer extension analysis and the properties of mutations affecting the P1 activator binding site and the 210 and 235 promoter sequences of both P1 and P2 are all consistent with these promoter designations . 
The P2 promoter is divergently transcribed from a promoter for the potABCD operon . 
The signiﬁcance of this arrangement is unclear , but it is interesting that pepT and potABCD are also divergently transcribed in both E. coli and Haemophilus inﬂu-enzae ( 14 ) . 
Although the wild-type pepT P1 promoter is completely dependent on FNR for anaerobic expression , the pepT200 mutation , which changes the 210 region from near consensus ( AA TAAT ) to consensus ( TATAAT ) , allows six - to sevenfold anaerobic induction of pepT-lacZ in the absence of FNR . 
For several reasons , we thought that CRP-cAMP might be responsible for the anaerobic induction in a pepT200 pepT-lacZ fnr strain . 
( i ) CRP and FNR are related transcriptional activators which appear to be structurally similar ( 25 , 39 ) and have been shown to be functionally similar in several promoter contexts ( 4 , 36 , 37 , 49 ) . 
( ii ) CRP and FNR recognize similar 22-bp palindromic consensus sequences ( 39 ) . 
Comparison of the consensus sites shows that they differ at only two conserved positions ( 5 and 18 [ Fig. 1 ] ) . 
Several studies have shown that substitutions at positions 5 and 18 can be sufﬁcient to switch the speciﬁcity of a site from one activator to the other ( 4 , 49 ) . 
( iii ) The pepT FNR site is a hybrid CRP-FNR binding site ( CF site [ Fig. 1 ] ) . 
The base pair at position 5 is that conserved in the CRP consensus site , while the base pair at position 18 is that conserved in the FNR consensus site . 
( iv ) In order for CRP-cAMP to activate pepT under anaerobic conditions , cAMP levels must be elevated anaerobically . 
Unden and Duchene have shown that cAMP levels are nearly fourfold higher in E. coli grown in minimal glucose media under anaerobic conditions than in aerobically grown cells ( 43 ) . 
The results reported here demonstrate that CRP-cAMP is responsible for the anaerobic induction in fnr pepT200 strains . 
CRP-cAMP is required for anaerobic induction in a pepT200 fnr strain , since induction is dependent on wild-type alleles of both crp and cya . 
In a pepT200 pepT-lacZ strain , b-galactosi-dase expression is induced under aerobic conditions by growth in succinate medium ( 7-fold ) or in glucose minimal medium with added cAMP ( 11-fold ) . 
Primer extension analysis shows that transcription from the P1 promoter is activated by CRP . 
Studies of mutations in the pepT CF site which change positions 5 and 18 show that CRP-dependent expression in succinate medium is increased by mutation to the CRP consensus ( CC ) and decreased by mutation from the CRP consensus ( FF ) . 
These results indicate that CRP activates transcription in the pepT200 strain by binding to the hybrid site at 241 of the P1 promoter . 
These studies have also provided evidence that CRP-cAMP negatively regulates pepT expression in strains with the wildtype , nonconsensus 210 sequence . 
The results in Table 4 show that in crp or cya strains , there is a two - to threefold increase in the expression of pepT-lacZ in both the pepT1 and pepT200 backgrounds . 
A similar effect of the crp mutation is also seen with the pepT200 CF , FC , FF , and CC strains ( data not shown ) . 
These results can not be attributed to an indirect effect of CRP on fnr expression . 
Other studies have shown that the addition of glucose to anaerobically growing cells causes a two - to three fold decrease in fnr-lacZ expression , suggesting that CRP has a positive effect on expression of FNR rather than a negative effect ( 33 , 38 ) . 
We suggest that under certain conditions ( e.g. , anaerobic growth in glucose ) , CRP-cAMP might compete with FNR for occupancy of the CF site at the P1 promoter . 
Since CRP-cAMP is a poor activator ( without the consensus 210 ) , it would effectively decrease FNR-dependent expression under these conditions . 
It is important to note that while the single base pair substitution to the CRP consensus site ( CC ) results in increased CRP-dependent expression in the pepT200 background ( Table 7 ) , it does not enhance CRP-dependent expression of the wildtype 210 promoter as measured by anaerobic induction in fnr mutant backgrounds ( Table 6 ) or by growth in succinate ( data not shown ) . 
This result emphasizes the importance of the 210 sequence relative to the activator binding site in determining the speciﬁcity of activation at this promoter . 
Recent studies by Wing et al. ( 48 ) suggest that FNR-dependent promoters may have a more stringent requirement for particular 235 sequences than do CRP-dependent promoters . 
Our observations along with those of Wing et al. suggest that there is a complex interplay between promoter elements and activator proteins . 
The sequence and location of the activator binding site do not alone determine the speciﬁcity and efﬁciency of activation . 
The fact that the consensus 210 is required for CRP-depen-dent activation raises an interesting question . 
The pepT P1 promoter can be considered a typical class II CRP-dependent promoter because of the 241 position of the hybrid site ( 9 ) . 
Why is the consensus 210 required for efﬁcient activation by CRP ? 
Apparently CRP can not make the contacts with RNA polymerase at the pepT promoter that are required either for recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter or for activation . 
We have found that a CRP allele ( K52N ) isolated by Bell et al. ( 3 ) enables CRP to activate transcription of the wild-type pepT promoter ( 27a ) . 
This mutation has been shown to allow increased activation at class II CRP-dependent promoters without affecting DNA binding afﬁnity and has been proposed to create an activation surface in CRP that resembles that of FNR ( 3 , 46 , 47 ) . 
The ability of K52N CRP to activate transcription of pepT in the absence of the consensus 210 supports the idea that although CRP is able to bind the CF site of the P1 promoter , it is a poor activator of transcription . 
There are two obvious explanations for the effect of the consensus 210 sequence in allowing CRP activation : ( i ) the consensus site may have a higher afﬁnity for RNA polymerase so that an intrinsically weak interaction with CRP is sufﬁcient to promote binding , or ( ii ) the binding of the polymerase to the consensus 210 changes the polymerase 's structure in such a way that a surface capable of interacting more productively with a CRP activation surface is displayed . 
The observed inﬂuence of the 210 sequence on activator speciﬁcity is unexpected . 
An improved 210 sequence might be expected to increase promoter strength both in the presence and in the absence of an activator protein . 
Such an increase has been observed in mutants that improve the 210 sequences of both the CRP-activated galP1 promoter ( 26 ) and the FNR-regulated narGHJI promoter ( 45 ) . 
The characterization of the promoter region of pepT has revealed an interesting overlap between the CRP and FNR regulons . 
It has previously been suggested by several workers that the similarities between CRP and FNR and between their DNA recognition sites may have regulatory implications ( 4 , 12 ) . 
It appears that under appropriate growth conditions , CRP-cAMP can activate gene expression in response to anaerobiosis . 
The major player in the regulation of the wild-type pepT gene ( at least under the conditions that we have tested ) appears to be FNR , with CRP having relatively small and apparently negative effects . 
It seems reasonable to suggest , however , that there may be natural promoters which can be activated by either CRP or FNR in a manner similar to the pepT pepT200 promoter . 
Such promoters would be subject to dual regulation by both CRP and FNR in response to changes in cAMP levels and anaerobiosis , with the complexities that would arise from competition between the two activators for the shared site . 
Several other genes which are regulated by both FNR and CRP , including glpA ( 20 ) , ansB ( 22 , 23 ) , cea ( 13 ) , and caiF ( 11 ) , have been described . 
For most of these promoters , the activator binding sites have not been completely deﬁned , but to our knowledge , none has been shown to involve competition between FNR and CRP for a single binding site . 
The E. coli ansB promoter , the most fully characterized of the group , clearly contains distinct binding sites for each activator . 
The FNR binding site in the ansB promoter is centered at 41.5 bp upstream of the major transcription start site ( 17 , 22 ) . 
CRP interacts with the ansB promoter at a CF site 28 bp upstream from the FNR binding site . 
FNR does not bind to this hybrid site ( 17 ) . 
A system in which two related regulators compete for the same binding site has recently been described by Darwin and Stewart ( 6 ) . 
In this system , NarL and NarP compete for a single binding site in the promoter of the aeg-46 .5 operon , but only NarL can activate transcription . 
To our knowledge , the pepT gene provides the ﬁrst example of a natural promoter in which FNR and CRP compete for the same recognition sequence . 
This report also presents the ﬁrst evidence that the 210 sequence can inﬂuence the speciﬁcity of activation at an upstream activator binding site .
