Abstract 
Addition of cytochrome b5 to recombinant cytochrome P450 2E1 systems has been shown to enhance the metabolism of dialkylnitrosamines in vitro . 
To determine if this effect could be observed with recombinant expression systems in vivo , we have constructed mutagenicity tester strains that coexpress full-length human cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) , rat cytochrome P450 reductase , and human cytochrome b5 in Salmonella typhimurium lacking ogt and ada methyltransferases ( YG7104 , ogt − ; and YG7108 , ogt − , ada − ) . 
These new recombinant strains exhibit a four - to ﬁve-fold greater mutagenic response to dimethylnitrosamine , diethylnitrosamine , and dipropylnitrosamine than strains that contain only CYP2E1 and reductase , and are over 100-fold more sensitive to nitrosamines than the parental strains in the presence of an exogenous activating system ( S9 fraction ) . 
The four-fold increase in mutagenicity in the presence of cytochrome b5 was consistent with increasing alkyl chain length up to dibutylnitrosamine , which was poorly activated by CYP2E1 . 
The greatest enhancement was obtained with a tricistronic construct in which the b5 cDNA preceded the P450 and reductase cDNAs ; placing the b5 cDNA after the reductase cDNA was substantially less effective . 
These new , highly sensitive strains may prove useful in the detection of nitrosamine contamination of food and environmental samples .

1. Introduction
Cytochrome b5 is a ubiquitous , 17 kDa electron transfer protein capable of accepting and transferring a single electron at a redox midpoint potential of 20 mV . 
Cytochrome b5 is found in most tissues

bound to the endoplasmic reticulum ; in erythrocytes it exists in a soluble form and is involved in methemoglobin reduction . 
This hemeprotein provides electron-reducing equivalents that support a number of metabolic reactions including fatty acid desaturation and elongation , plasmalogen biosynthesis , sterol biosynthesis , and P450 monooxygenation by some isoforms of this enzyme [ 1 ] . 
The mechanism by which cytochrome b5 enhances cytochrome P450 reactions is poorly understood . 
It has been shown that cytochrome b5 can stimulate , inhibit , or have no effect on P450 substrate metabolism and that these effects depend on the speciﬁc isozyme , the substrate , and the assay conditions for any given reaction . 
It is thought that cytochrome b5 stimulates CYP2E1-dependent reactions via donation of the second electron needed to drive the P450 monooxygenase cycle [ 2 ] . 
For example , addition of cytochrome b5 to reconstituted CYP2E1 systems lowered the Km for dimethylnitrosamine ( DMN ) by nine-fold and increased the Vmax by 30 % , but had little effect on aniline metabolism , another CYP2E1-speciﬁc substrate [ 3 ] . 
Similarly , addition of cytochrome b5 increased the turnover of chlorzoxazone , p-nitrophenol , and acetaminophen by human and rat CYP2E1 in reconstituted systems , and lowered the Km for chlorzoxazone [ 4 ] . 
With recombinant expression systems , cytochrome b5 coexpression lowered the Km for DMN and increased the Vmax in isolated membrane preparations [ 5,6 ] . 
Patten and Koch [ 6 ] demonstrated that the addition or coexpression of b5 markedly decreased uncoupled NADPH oxidation and hydrogen peroxide production , suggesting that the presence of cytochrome b5 enhances the coupling between CYP2E1 and P450 reductase . 
Our previous work with the coexpression of CYP2E1 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in methyltransferase-deﬁcient strains of Salmonella typhimurium yielded two recombinant bacterial strains with excellent sensitivity to the mutagenicity of small molecular weight nitrosamines [ 7 ] . 
The base strains , created by Nohmi and co-workers [ 8 ] , lack one or both of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferases involved in the repair of DNA alkylation damage : strain YG7104 contains a disrupted ogt gene , encoding a constitutive 19 kDa methyltransferase , whereas strain YG7108 lacks both the ogt gene product , as well as the ada gene product , an inducible 39 kDa methyltransferase [ 8 ] . 
The coexpression of human CYP2E1 and P450 reductase in these strains made them sensitive to nitrosamine mutagenicity in the absence of an external activating system ( S9 fraction ) ; the latter strain , YG7108 , exhibited the greatest sensitivity to a series of short-chain nitrosamines in our studies [ 7 ] . 
Kushida et al. [ 9 ] have reported similar results . 
Given the ability of cytochrome b5 to enhance nitrosamine metabolism by P450 2E1 [ 3,5,6 ] , these CYP2E1/reductase coexpressing bacterial strains present a unique opportunity to examine the inﬂuence of cytochrome b5 on CYP2E1-mediated reactions in vivo .

Herein , we describe the construction of two methyltransferase-deﬁcient S. typhimurium strains that express the full-length genes for human CYP2E1 , its electron-transfer partner , NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase , and cytochrome b5 . 
The resulting strains show four to ﬁve-fold greater sensitivity to dialkylnitrosamine mutagenicity than the parental strains containing only CYP2E1 and reductase , and much greater sensitivity to these substances than mutagenicity systems that employ an external mutagen activating system ( S9 fraction ) . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmid construction
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 . 
Dr. T. Nohmi ( National Institute of Health Sciences , Tokyo , Japan ) graciously provided S. typhimurium strains YG7104 ( ogt − ) and YG7108 ( ogt − , ada − ) . 
The pIN3ER plasmid for human CYP2E1 and rat P450 reductase coexpression was constructed as described elsewhere [ 10 ] ; the cDNA encoding the human , membrane-bound form of cytochrome b5 was graciously provided by Dr. Alan Steggles , Northeastern Ohio Universities [ 11 ] . 
Pfu polymerase was purchased from Stratagene Inc. ( La Jolla , CA ) ; oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Operon Technologies Inc. ( Alameda , CA ) . 
A cytochrome b5 expression plasmid ( pIN3b5 ) was created by insertion of a human cytochrome b5 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ampliﬁcation product , containing XbaI and HindIII sites engineered upstream and downstream of the cytochrome b5 coding sequence , into the pINIIIompA3 expression vector [ 12 ] . 
The tricistronic expression plasmid with cytochrome b5 upstream of the P450 and reductase cDNAs ( pIN3b5ER ) was then created by ampliﬁcation of the CYP2E1/reductase cDNAs from pIN3ER with a forward primer which introduced a HindIII site upstream of the CYP2E1 cDNA and a reverse primer positioned downstream of the HindIII site that follows the reductase cDNA . 
This ampliﬁcation product was digested with HindIII and ligated into the HindIII site immediately downstream of the cytochrome b5 cDNA in pIN3b5 . 
A clone with the CYP2E1 and reductase cDNAs in the correct orientation wa identiﬁed by restriction mapping and sequencing ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The tricistronic expression plasmid with cytochrome b5 positioned downstream of the P450 2E1 and reductase cDNAs ( pIN3ERb5 ) was created by overlap-extension polymerase chain ampliﬁcation , using overlap primers that spanned the end of the reductase cDNA and the translation initiation region of the cytochrome b5 cDNA in pIN3b5 . 
The outside primers were located upstream of a unique NheI site in the reductase cDNA and downstream of an AgeI site in the pIN3b5 plasmid . 
The overlap-ampliﬁcation product was restriction-digested with these enzymes and ligated into the NheI and AgeI sites in pIN3ER , yielding pIN3ERb5 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Plasmids were introduced into the bacterial strains via electroporation ; fresh transformants were selected for each mutagenicity assay by growth on Luria -- Bertani nutrient agar plates containing 100 g ampicillin/ml .

2.2. Analysis of enzyme expression
Bacterial membranes were prepared by cell lysis with a French press as previously described [ 13 ] . 
Proteins were separated by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . 
Puriﬁed recombinant human CYP2E1 and cytochrome b5 were purchased from PanVera Corp. ( Madison , WI ) . 
The immunoblots were probed with sheep polyclonal antibody to rabbit CYP2E1 , sheep polyclonal antibody to rabbit P450 reductase ( each kindly provided by Dr. Minor Coon , Department of Biological Chemistry , University of Michigan ) , and goat polyclonal antibody to rabbit cytochrome b5 ( Oxford Biomedical Research , Oxford , MI ) . 
All immunoblots were developed with secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) . 
P450 reductase expression was quantiﬁed by means of cytochrome c reduction ( assuming speciﬁc activity of 3 mol/min/ml = 1 nmol cytochrome P450 reductase/ml ) [ 14 ] . 
2.3. Mutation assays
Reversion assays were performed as described [ 15 ] . 
Bacterial colonies from freshly transformed cells wer picked and grown overnight in Oxoid Nutrient Broth No. 2 ( Unipath Ltd. , Basingstoke , UK ) with 100 g/ml of ampicillin at 37 ◦ C and shaking at 250 rpm . 
Expression of CYP2E1 , reductase , and cytochrome b5 was induced with 1 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) at 10 h post-inoculation . 
Preincubation time , temperature , and pH had no effect on reversion assays [ 7 ] . 
All assays were performed in triplicate , and revertant colonies were counted after 48 h. Dialkylnitrosamines were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) .

3. Results
3.1. Coexpression of CYP2E1 and P450 reductase in S. typhimurium
We were unable to accurately quantify CYP2E1 expression spectrophotometrically in the YG7108ER , YG7108b5ER , and YG7108ERb5 strains due to the low expression levels . 
Previous studies indicated that CYP2E1 was expressed at about 20 nmol/l in S. typhimurium , and reductase was approximately twice as abundant [ 7,10 ] . 
Quantitation of P450 reductase by cytochrome c reduction ( Table 2 ) indicated that expression of this enzyme was similar to that obtained in previous studies , approximately 40 nmol/l . 
Spectrophotometric determination of cytochrome b5 was also inconclusive due to the high background absorbency of other bacterial cytochromes . 
Immunoblots , however , conﬁrmed the expression of CYP2E1 and P450 reductase in strains YG7108ER , YG7108b5ER and YG7108ERb5 ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Cytochrome b5 expression was also conﬁrmed via immunoblotting in strains YG7108b5ER and YG7108ERb5 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
3.2. Cytochrome b5-expressing strains are more sensitive to dialkylnitrosamine mutagenicity
As described previously , DMN was able to elicit a dose-dependent mutagenic response in the CYP2E1 and P450 reductase coexpressing strain YG7108ER in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activating system [ 7 ] . 
The sensitivity to DMN increased nearly ﬁve-fold when human cytochrome b5 was coexpressed via insertion of the b5 cDNA upstream of the CYP2E1 and reductase cDNAs ( Fig. 4 ) . 
When the b5 cDNA was inserted downstream of these cDNAs DMN mutagenicity increased only slightly over that obtained with YG7108ER . 
Thus , placement of the b cDNA in 5 front of the CYP2E1/reductase cDNAs was markedly more effective than downstream placement , perhaps due to attenuated transcription or translation of the b5 cDNA with the downstream construct . 
Parallel studies with the YG7104 strain ( ogt − ) yielded similar , but less robust results that were consistent with the weaker mutagenic response previously obtained with this single-deletion strain [ 7 ] ( data not shown ) . 
The coexpression of both CYP2E1 and reductase was necessary to obtain a mutagenic response , as noted previously [ 7 ] ( data not shown ) . 
Strain YG7108b5ER was approximately 100-fold more sensitive to DMN than was the parent strain , YG7108 , in the presence of 4 % S9 fraction from ethanol-treated rats ( cf. [ 7 ] ) . 
Although diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) was 10 - to 20-fold less mutagenic than DMN , the effect of b5 expression was similar , with YG7108b ER demon-5 strating a four-fold increase in sensitivity while YG7108ERb5 was only slightly more sensitive than YG7108ER , which lacks the b5 cDNA ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Similar results were also obtained with the weaker mutagens dipropylnitrosamine ( DPN ) and dibutylnitrosamine ( DBN ) , where placement of the b5 cDNA ahead of the P450/reductase cDNAs yielded a markedly greater mutagenic response than that obtained when the b5 cDNA was placed behind the P450/reductase cDNAs , or omitted altogether ( Figs. 6 and 7 ) . 
The increase in the mutagenicity of DBN with cytochrome b5 coexpression was only about two-fold , somewhat less than that obtained with the shorter chain alkylnitrosamines , but consistent with the established preference of CYP2E1 for shorter chain alkylnitrosamines [ 16 ] .

These 11 kb plasmids contain cDNAs for human cytochrome b5 , human CYP2E1 , and rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase on the pINIIIompA3 expression vector [ 12 ] . 
Expression is driven by the lpp -- lac fusion promoter ( lpp -- lac PO > ) , under control of the lacI repressor protein , and thus is inducible by IPTG . 
amp + encodes - lactamase for ampicillin-resistance ; ORI represents the plasmid origin of replication ; and lpp trm is the transcription terminator sequence from the lpp gene .

4. Discussion
The creation of short-term , in vitro genotoxicity assays that utilize heterologously expressed human xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes has been of great interest in recent years [ 17 ] . 
Various systems have been constructed using cytochrome P450 enzymes , cytochrome P450 reductase , P450/P450 reductase fusion proteins , and acetyltransferases expressed separately or in combination in many different genetic backgrounds [ 18 -- 25 ] . 
Each of these systems has shown sensitivity to test compounds without the need for S9 , the rat liver supernatant fraction normally used to activate mutagens to their reactive forms . 
In this study we have examined the effect of coexpression of human cytochrome b5 , human CYP2E1 , and rat P450 reductase on nitrosamine mutagenicity . 
The coexpression of cytochrome b5 in the previously established CYP2E1/reductase coexpressing strains provided an ideal opportunity to examine the effect of this electron transfer protein on nitrosamine metabolism in vivo . 
Most studies to date have examined the role of cytochrome b5 on in vitro systems using reconstituted or recombinant enzymes . 
For example , addition of cytochrome b5 to reconstituted CYP2E1 systems lowered the Km for DMN by nine-fold and increased the Vmax by 30 % [ 3 ] , and increased the turnover of chlorzoxazone , p-nitrophenol , and acetaminophen [ 4 ] . 
With recombinant expression systems , cytochrome b5 coexpression lowered the Km for DMN and increased the Vmax in isolated membrane preparations [ 5,6 ] , and , notably , increased the turnover of nifedipine and testosterone by CYP3A4 in whole cells [ 26 ] . 
With regard to CYP2E1-mediated nitrosamine activation , the addition of cytochrome b5 to a reconstituted CYP2E1 preparation used as an exogenous activating system in a Salmonella umu mutagenicity assay increased the mutagenicity of DMN and DEN by 1.5-fold [ 27 ] , similar to the four-fold enhancement found here . 
We show here that S. typhimurium strains YG7108b5ER and YG7108ERb5 express cytochrome P450 2E1 , P450 reductase , and cytochrome b5 simultaneously and that the presence of cytochrome b5 increases nitrosamine mutagenicity by as much as ﬁve-fold in these cells relative to cells lacking this auxiliary electron transport protein . 
Thus , these studies support and extend the in vitro studies noted above on the stimulatory effect of cytochrome b5 on nitrosamine metabolism . 
The mutagenicity of all nitrosamines investigated increased in a dose-dependent fashion without the addition of rat liver S9 fraction . 
Moreover , this mutagenicity was inhibited by ethanol , a potent inhibitor of CYP2E1 ( data not shown ) . 
Cytochrome b5 similarly enhanced the mutagenicity of nitrosamines in YG7104 cells ( ogt − ) , although the mutagenic response was signiﬁcantly lower than that obtained with YG7108 ( ogt − , ada − ) , as was found previously [ 7 ] . 
The genotoxic potency of the nitrosamines in all strains was DMN > DEN > 
Fig. 7 . 
Effect of cytochrome b5 expression on DBN mutagenicity in YG7108 tester strains . 
Values are the means of three experiments in triplicate with standard error bars . 
DPN > DBN , and the magnitude of the cytochrome b5 enhancement was similar ( four-fold ) with DMN , DEN , and DPN , but reduced two-fold with DBN , a relatively poor substrate for CYP2E1 . 
Placing the cytochrome b5 cDNA in front of the CYP2E1 and reductase cDNAs consistently yielded a better mutagenic response than when it followed these cDNAs . 
The level of expression of cytochrome b5 from the latter construct appeared to be less than half of that obtained when the b cDNA preceded the 5 P450/reductase cDNAs , based on immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Thus , it may be that transcription and/or translation through the P450 and reductase sequences attenuates before it reaches the b5 sequence , thereby yielding a lower level of expression than that obtained when these processes initiate at the b5 sequence . 
It is also possible that the 40 bp spacing between the end of the reductase coding sequence and the ribosome binding site for the cytochrome b5 sequence contributes to the lower b expression ; the spacing between the other 5 coding sequences/ribosome binding sites in these two plasmids is 11 -- 19 basepairs . 
Regardless , it is clear that positioning has a signiﬁcant effect on expression and activity of proteins encoded by multicistronic plasmids . 
This study is complementary to other recent work in which cytochrome b5 was coexpressed with human P450s and P450 reductase in various heterologous systems [ 26,28 -- 30 ] . 
The development of these coexpression systems is a valuable tool for investigating the role of cytochrome b5 in vivo . 
In addition , the creation of the bacterial tester strains used in this study provides researchers with extremely sensitive tools for studying CYP2E1-mediated mutagenicity and for the detection of short-chain nitrosamines in food and environmental samples . 
This study adds to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that recombinant Ames strains are viable alternatives to exogenous mammalian enzyme preparations for mutagen activation ; moreover , the use of recombinant human P450s makes these systems especially relevant to the identiﬁcation of chemicals that are mutagenic or carcinogenic to man .
