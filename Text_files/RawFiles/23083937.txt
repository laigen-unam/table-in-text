In our previous study , we constructed a vaccine candidate ( JOL916 ) for fowl typhoid ( FT ) . 
A live adjuvant Salmonella Gallinarum ( SG ) strain was generated in the present study to facilitate efﬁcacious oral vaccination with this vaccine . 
The Escherichia coli eltB gene secreting heat-labile + enterotoxin B subunit ( LTB ) was cloned into an Asd plasmid pJHL65 . 
This was transformed into a lon cpxR asd SG strain and the resulting strain was designated JOL1229 . 
Secretion of LTB from JOL1229 was conﬁrmed with an immunoblot assay . 
To determine the optimal dose of the strain , 50 six-week-old female chickens were divided into ﬁve groups ( Groups A -- E , n = 10 per group ) and orally inoculated with various doses of JOL1229 and JOL916 . 
In Group B ( consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 ) , signiﬁcant cell-mediated immune responses , plasma IgG levels and intestinal secretary IgA levels were induced after inoculation with both strains . 
On challenge with the wild-type strain , significant reductions in mortality were observed in the group . 
In addition , after inoculation the LTB strain was not recovered in feces samples , and resulted in no , or very mild , gross lesions in the liver and spleen . 
Both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells were signiﬁcantly increased in peripheral blood samples from the chickens immunized with the LTB strain . 
Expression of the interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) gene in splenocytes was induced in the chickens immunized with the LTB strain . 
These results suggest that oral immunization with the LTB-adjuvant strain , in particular with the four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 mixture , increased the immune response and provided efﬁcient protection against FT in chickens .

Introduction 
inactivated Salmonella strains have been tested as potential vaccines for FT in fowl model systems ( Barrow et al. , 1990 ; Zhang-Barber et al. , 1999 ) . 
Undeﬁned mutant rough strain SG9R , one representative vaccine strain among these potential vaccine strains , was introduced in the 1950s ( Smith , 1956 ) and was recommended for control against FT ( Lee et al. , 2005 ) . 
However , SG9R leads to hepatitis and splenic lesions due to some residual virulence ( Silva et al. , 1981 ) and does not provide sufﬁcient protection against wild-type SG infection ( Bouzoubaa et al. , 1989 ) . 
In particular , the biggest disadvantage of SG9R vaccination is the fact that it must be administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly , which can be uneconomical an narum ( Salmonella Gallinarum , SG ) causes fowl typhoid ( FT ) , a severe septicemic disease of domesticated birds and other avian species ( Pomeroy and Nagaraja , 1991 ) . 
FT causes considerable economic losses in many countries throughout Latin America , South America , Africa and Asia ( Shivaprasad , 2000 ) .

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.09.006 laborious . 
Recently , SG mutant ( JOL916 ) was constructed by deleting the lon and cpxR genes , which are related to the host-pathogen interaction as a live vaccine candidate for FT ( Matsuda et al. , 2010a ) . 
JOL916 was demonstrated to be safe , induced the development of acquired immunity , and offered protection against FT in chickens ( Matsuda et al. , 2010b , 2011a , b ) . 
It is generally accepted that cell-mediated immunity is more important than humoral immune responses for protection against Salmonella in poultry , while IgA antibody responses seem to play a signiﬁcant role in the intestinal clearance of Salmonella ( Barrow , 2007 ; Chappell et al. , 2009 ; Van Immerseel et al. , 2005 ) . 
Cell-mediated immunity is crucial to controlling and clearing facultative intracellular bacteria such as Salmonella ( Alvarez et al. , 2003 ) . 
Mucosal immunity is also important in protec-ting mucosal surfaces against invasion and colonization by microbes , blocking the uptake of ungraded antigens , including foreign proteins from ingested food and symbiotic microorganisms , and preventing the development of potentially injurious immune responses to these antigens ( Holmgren and Czerkinsky , 2005 ) . 
Mucosally administered vaccines have several potential advantages , including enhancement of the mucosal surfaces , as well as systemic immunity , increased stability , extended shelf life , and the lack of a need for needles or specialists to administer them ( Freytag and Clements , 2005 ) . 
Most antigens , on the other hand , are poor immunogens when administered mucosally , including via the oral route , and at worst have results in terms of immunological tolerance or unresponsiveness as a result of induced tolerance ( Yuki and Kiyono , 2003 ) . 
It is well-known that Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit protein ( LTB ) is robust as an adjuvant and is capable of modulating immune responses ( Fischer et al. , 2010 ) . 
LTB also has the potential to act as an efﬁcient carrier without danger of toxiﬁcation after administration ( Fingerut et al. , 2005 ) . 
In this study , an attenuated SG strain containing a recombinant plasmid harboring the eltB gene encoding the LTB protein was constructed as a live adjuvant for oral vaccination to prevent FT in chickens . 
We evaluated the adjuvant effect of this LTB strain by observing the immune responses and protection efﬁcacy , and also determined the optimal dose of the strain for oral inoculation . 
In addition , the safety of the strain was analyzed by evaluating fecal shedding after inoculation , and the presence of gross lesions and bacterial recovery from the liver and spleen in immunized chickens . 
The T-lymphocyte subpopulations from peripheral blood samples and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) mRNA expression in splenocytes were also evaluated to provide more speciﬁc immunological data .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
Six-week-old female Lohmann Brown layer chickens were used in the study . 
All birds were given ad libitum access to water and antibiotic-free feed . 
The animal experiments in this study were performed under the approval of the Chonbuk National University Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Korean Council on Animal Care ( CBU 2011-0017 ) . 
2.2. Bacterial strains and plasmids
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
The vaccine candidate strain , JOL916 , was constructed by deleting the lon and cpxR genes of the wild-type SG strain , JOL394 ( Matsuda et al. , 2010a ) . 
The SG strain JOL967 was constructed by deleting the asd gene of JOL916 using an allelic exchange method ( Kang et al. , 2002 ) and was used as the delivery strain for the eltB gene encoding the LTB protein . 
The wild-type JOL420 SG strain was used as the challenge + strain . 
An Asd plasmid , pJHL65 , was used for delivering the eltB gene . 
All bacterial strains in this study were grown at 37 ◦ C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Becton , Dickinson and Company , Sparks , MD , USA ) . 
Diaminopimelic acid ( DAP ) ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA ) was added ( 50 g/ml ) to facilitate the growth of the JOL967 strain . 
2.3. Cloning the LTB gene
For construction of the LTB strain , a DNA fragment of the eltB gene from + LTB E. coli was ampliﬁed using eltB-F and eltB-R primers ( Table 2 ) . 
Ampliﬁed DNA digested with EcoRI and HindIII was cloned into pJHL65 digested with the same restriction enzymes , thereby resulting in pJHL65-LTB ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The pJHL65-LTB plasmid was transformed into JOL967 by electroporation and the resultant LTB adjuvant strain was designated as JOL1229 . 
2.4. Immunoblot analysis
LTB protein secretion from the JOL1229 strain was veriﬁed using immunoblot analysis . 
The strain was cultured in LB broth at 37 ◦ C with continuous shaking in order to prepare the secreted proteins from JOL1229 . 
The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 3400 × g for 20 min at an optical density ( OD ) at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.8 . 
The cultured supernatants were passed through a 0.22 m pore size ﬁlter and precipitated overnight with 20 % ( v/v ) trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) to detect secreted forms of proteins . 
The protein samples from the JOL1229 strain were boiled for 5 min at 95 ◦ C and separated by 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) . 
Subsequent immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described ( Hur and Lee , 2011 ) . 
2.5. Immunization of the chickens
In experiment 1 , 50 six-week-old female chickens were divided into ﬁve groups ( n = 10 per group ) to determine the optimal immunization dose for the LTB adjuvant strain . 
Each bird in the immunized groups was orally inoculated with 200 l of bacterial suspension containing 1 × 108 colony-forming units ( cfu ) , and each chicken in the control group was given 200 l of PBS . 
Group A chickens were immunized with a mixture consisting of one part JOL916 ( 0.5 × 108 cfu ) and one part JOL1229 ( 0.5 × 108 cfu ) . 
Group B chickens were immunized with mixture consisting of four parts JOL916 ( 0.8 × 108 cfu ) and one part JOL1229 ( 0.2 8 immunized with a mixture consisting of nine parts JOL916 ( 0.9 × 108 cfu ) and one part JOL1229 ( 0.1 × 108 cfu ) . 
Group D chickens were immunized with JOL916 only ( 1 8 and Group E chickens were inoculated with PBS as the control group ( Table 3 ) .

2.6. Evaluation of immune responses and protection efﬁcacy
2.6.1. Humoral immune response
Indirect ELISA was performed with an outer membrane protein ( OMP ) fraction that was extracted from the wild-type SG strain , JOL420 . 
The plasma sample was separated by peripheral blood centrifugation to determine the plasma IgG concentration . 
Intestinal lavage samples were collected using pilocarpine-based lavage ( Porter and Holt , 1992 ) . 
All plasma and intestinal lavage samples were collected weekly in experiment 1 . 
Evaluation of plasma IgG and intestinal secretory IgA ( sIgA ) concentrations was performed as previously described using chicken IgG and IgA ELISA Quantitation Kits ( Bethyl Laboratories , TX , USA ) ( Matsuda et al. , 2010b ) . 
2.6.2. Cell-mediated immune responses
In experiment 1 , peripheral blood samples were collected aseptically from ﬁve randomly selected birds per group three weeks after immunization . 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were separated using the Histopaque ® -1077 ( Sigma -- Aldrich , St. Louis , MO , USA ) . 
The lymphocyte proliferation assay ( LPA ) was performed with speciﬁc antigens prepared from the wild-type JOL394 SG strain as previously described , with slight modiﬁcation ( Matsuda et al. , 2010b ; Rana and Kulshreshtha , 2006 ) . 
Brieﬂy , 100 l of cell suspension at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium were incubated in 96-well tissue culture plates with 50 l of medium alone or medium containing 4 g/ml of SG soluble antigen at 40 ◦ C , in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO2 atmosphere for 72 h. Lymphocyte proliferation activity was measured using adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) bioluminescence with the ViaLight ® Plus Kit ( Lonza Rockland , ME , USA ) and a luminometer ( TriStarLB941 , Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. , Germany ) . 
The blastogenic response for the assay was expressed as the mean stimulation index ( SI ) , calculated by dividing the mean of OD value of the culture stimulated with the antigen by the mean of OD value of the non-stimulated culture ( Rana and Kulshreshtha , 2006 ) . 
2.6.3. Protection efﬁcacy against challenge
Chickens in all of the groups ( Group A to E ) were orally challenged with 200 l of bacterial suspension containing 1 × 106 cfu of JOL420 during the fourth week post-immunization ( wpi ) . 
Mortality was assessed daily for 14 days after the challenge . 
After all remaining animals appeared to have recovered , they were euthanized on the 14th day post-challenge ( dpc ) for gross pathological and histopathological examinations . 
Gross lesions in the livers and spleens were observed and scored as previously described ( Matsuda et al. , 2010b ) . 
2.6.4. Histopathological examination
Spleen and liver tissue samples from chickens that died naturally or were euthanized were immediately ﬁxed in 10 % neutral phosphate-buffered formalin . 
The section were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) and examined using light microscopy . 
Photomicrographs were taken using a light microscope ( BX-51 , Olympus Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) and digital imaging software ( analysis TS , Olympus Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) .

2.7.1. Fecal shedding after immunization
at one , two , three , ﬁve and seven days after immunization in experiment 2 . 
Fecal samples from ﬁve randomly selected chickens from Groups I and III were collected with buffered peptone water ( BPW ) ( Becton , Dickinson and Company , Sparks , MD , USA ) , and homogenized . 
Enumeration and subsequent enrichment culture were performed as previously described ( Nandre et al. , 2012 ) . 
Positive colonies were con-ﬁrmed with PCR using OMPC primers for the Salmonella genus , SG primers for S. Gallinarum , lon and cpxR primers for the vaccine strain and LTB primers for the LTB adjuvant strain ( Table 2 ) ( Alvarez et al. , 2004 ; Kang et al. , 2011 ) . 
The number of positive colonies was expressed as the log10 of cfu/g . 
Positive samples after enrichment were denoted as 1 cfu/g , while unchanged negative samples were counted as 0 cfu/g . 
Fecal shedding of the LTB adjuvant strain was monitored

peripheral blood after immunization , ﬂow cytometry analysis was performed in experiment 2 . 
Peripheral blood samples from ﬁve chickens in each group were collected from jugular veins with a heparinized syringe on the seventh day post-vaccination . 
PBMCs were isolated using Histopaque ® -1077 ( Sigma -- Aldrich , St. Louis , MO , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and stained with monoclonal antibodies against CD3 , CD4 and CD8 ( Beckman Coulter , CA , USA ) as previously described ( Jawale et al. , 2012 ) . 
The analysis was carried out using a FACS CaliburTM ( Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , San Jose , CA , USA ) instrument equipped with a 15 mW , To analyze changes in the T-lymphocyte subsets in 
488 nm air-cooled argon laser . 
Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software ( Treestar , Inc. , San Carlos , CA , USA ) . 
2.9. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis for cytokine expression
In experiment 2 , pooled spleen cells from the immunized and unimmunized chickens ( n = 5 per group ) on the fourth wpi were harvested and cultured ( 1 × 106 cells/well ) in 24-well tissue culture plates at 40 ◦ C with 5 % CO2 for 72 h in the presence of 4 g/ml of SG-speciﬁc antigen . 
Total RNA was extracted from the splenocytes using a Hybrid-RTM Total RNA Isolation Kit ( GeneAll , Korea ) , and subsequent cDNA synthesis was performed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . 
Levels of cytokine IL-6 mRNA expression were quantiﬁed with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) as previously described with slight modiﬁcation ( Carvajal et al. , 2008 ) . 
PCR was performed using the StepOnePlusTM Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) with the following cycle proﬁle : 1 cycle at 95 ◦ C for 15 ◦ min , and 40 cycles at 94 C for 15 s , 56 ◦ C for 25 s and 72 ◦ C for 30 s . 
The primers used to amplify IL-6 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) are presented in Table 2 . 
The threshold method was used to quantify the mRNA expression levels , and CT values were calculated based on the internal standard , GAPDH . 
Results are expressed as 2 − ( CT ) ( n-fold change compared to the non-treated control group ) ( Pfafﬂ , 2001 ) . 
2.10. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . 
All results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , unless otherwise speciﬁed . 
Comparisons between each immunized and the control group were made using the Mann -- Whitney U test . 
Differences in positive rates and mortality post-challenge were analyzed using the chi-square test . 
Statistical signiﬁcance was identiﬁed as a P value < 0.05 . 
3. Results
3.1. Secretion of LTB protein from JOL1229
The pJHL65-LTB plasmid ( Fig. 1 ) was transformed into the lon cpxR asd S. Gallinarum strain JOL967 , and the resultant LTB adjuvant strain was designated as JOL1229 . 
In order to conﬁrm the expression of LTB protein , immunoblot analysis was conducted with anti-histidine-tagged antibodies . 
An 11.6-kDa band , the monomer size of the LTB protein , was observed in the analysis of precipitated culture supernatants ( Fig. 2 ) . 
3.2. Humoral immune responses
To evaluate the humoral immune response , plasma IgG and intestinal sIgA concentrations were determined with indirect ELISA using the speciﬁc antigen extracted fro the wild-type SG strain JOL420 in experiment 1 . 
Antibody responses in the plasma and the intestinal lavage samples of the immunized and control chickens to the Salmonella antigen are illustrated in Fig. 3 . 
The plasma IgG titers in Groups B , C and D were signiﬁcantly elevated , 1.9 - , 2.4 - , and 2.1-fold , respectively , compared to the PBS control Group E on the ﬁrst wpi ( P < 0.05 ) . 
From the second to fourth wpi , plasma IgG concentrations in all of the immunized groups ( Groups A -- D ) were signiﬁcantly elevated compared to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
At fourth wpi , the plasma IgG concentrations of group B were elevated by approximately 1.6-fold than group D chickens . 
Intestinal sIgA titers in the chickens from Groups A and B were 1.2 and 1.6 times higher than in the control chickens on the third wpi , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) . 
On the fourth wpi , the intestinal sIgA titer in Group B chickens was 1.5 times signiﬁcantly higher than that in the control chickens ( P < 0.05 ) , and was approximately 1.4 times higher than that in Group D chickens ( Fig. 3B ) .

3.3. Cell-mediated immune responses
Cell-mediated immune responses were examined by LPA using the speciﬁc antigen extracted from the wild-type SG on the third wpi in experiment 1 . 
Lymphocyte proliferation responses to the SG antigen revealed a signiﬁcant increase in the stimulation indices ( SIs ) in all of the immunized groups compared to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . 
SI value in Group B was approximately 1.4-fold compared to those in Group D. SI values of 2.74 ± 0.59 , 3.08 ± 0.22 , 2.47 ± 0.62 , and 2.22 ± 0.65 were observed in Groups A , B , C and D , respectively , while the SI value of the control group was 1.01 ± 0.06 ( Fig. 4 ) . 
3.4. Protection efﬁcacy and pathological study after challenge
Chickens from each group were orally challenged with 1 × 106 cfu of the virulent wild-type SG JOL420 during the fourth week post-immunization in experiment 1 . 
The chickens in all of the immunized groups were markedly protected against FT ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The mortality rates in Groups A , B , C , D and E were 20 % , 10 % , 10 % , 20 % and 80 % , respectively ( Table 3 and Fig. 5 ) . 
On the 14th dpc , all surviving chickens were sacriﬁced for postmortem examination . 
The control group demonstrated severe pathological gross lesions scores of 2.6 ± 0.8 , 2.8 ± 0.6 , 2.4 ± 1.3 and 2.7 ± 0.7 for liver enlargement , liver necrotic foci , spleen enlargement and spleen necrotic foci , respectively ( Table 3 ) . 
However , the lesion scores in all the immunized groups were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the control group ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 or P < 0.001 ) ( Table 3 ) . 
Histopathological examination of the liver in the control group chickens revealed lesions characteristic of diffuse parenchymatous hepatitis , severe fatty dystrophy and focal necrosis of hepatocytes with inﬁltration of heterophil and lymphocytes into the hepatic parenchyma ( Fig. 6A ) . 
The spleen showed severe congestion and accumulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMN ) in red pulp and ﬁbrinous exudate in the vascular sinuses ( Fig. 6C ) . 
In contrast , fewer or no histopathological changes were found in the immunized groups , especially in Group B , which was given a mixture consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 in experiment 1 ( Figs. 6B and D ) .

3.5. Safety evaluation of the LTB-adjuvant strain in chickens
3.5.1. Fecal shedding and gross lesions after immunization
In experiment 2 , oral immunization with the LTB strain resulted in no obvious clinical signs during the experimental period . 
The strain was not isolated from fecal samples collected from the immunized groups on days 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 post-inoculation . 
The birds from the immunized group were euthanized weekly to perform postmortem examinations to evaluate the safety of the strain for ﬁve weeks after inoculation . 
From the ﬁrst to the fourth wpi , the birds in the immunized group demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences in the mean gross lesion values for the liver and spleen , compared to those of the unimmunized group , which resulted in 0.0 ± 0.0 for each ﬁnding . 
No enlargement or necrotic foci from the livers and spleens were identiﬁed in the immunized group at the ﬁfth wpi ( Table 4 ) . 
3.5.2 . 
Recovery of the adjuvant strain from internal organs In experiment 2 , bacterial persistence and clearance in the livers and spleens of chickens immunized with the LTB strain were also examined . 
All liver and spleen samples from the unimmunized group were negative for Salmonella . 
After enrichment , the LTB strain was recovered from the livers and spleens of the immunized chickens collected from the ﬁrst to the fourth wpi ( Table 5 ) . 
The mean recoveries from the liver in the immunized group were 1.7 ± 1.3 , 1.8 ± 1.6 , 0.6 ± 1.1 and 0.9 ± 1.5 log10 cfu/g on the ﬁrst , the second , third and fourth wpi , respectively . 
The mean recoveries from the spleen in the immunized group were 2.6 ± 0.4 , 3.5 ± 0.3 , 3.1 ± 0.7 and 1.2 ± 2.1 log10 cfu/g , respectively ( Table 5 ) . 
No colonies were recovered from the liver or spleen at the ﬁfth wpi . 
3.6. Proportion of circulating T-cells according to ﬂow cytometry analysis
T-lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood samples from the chickens in both the immunized and control groups were analyzed with ﬂow cytometry in experiment 2 . 
Analysis of the T-cell populations in Group I showed a signiﬁcantly increased number + + of both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes compared to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) , and the number of CD8 + lymphocytes was signiﬁcantly increased in Group II compared to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . 
In addition , + CD4 lymphocyte population of Group I was signiﬁcantly higher than those of Group II ( P < 0.05 ) . 
The percentages of CD3 + CD4 + lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples from Group I , II and III chickens were 57.5 % , 46.5 % and 46.5 % , respectively . 
The percentages of CD3 + CD8 + cells in PBMCs from Groups I , II and III chickens were 22.8 % , 19.4 % and 13.5 % , respectively ( Fig. 7 ) .

Stimulation of splenocytes in Group I with the speciﬁc antigen caused an approximately 4.5-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA expression compared to the control group . 
However , following the antigen stimulation in Group II , there was an approximately 4-fold decrease in IL-6 mRNA expression ( Fig. 8 ) . 
The levels of IL-6 mRNA were measured in the pooled 
4. Discussion
Oral antigens with adjuvants as incentives to signal mucosal antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) may be stronger and have broader immune effects without the induction of oral tolerance ( Holmgren and Czerkinsky , 2005 ; Mowat , 2003 ) . 
LTB is one of the promising bacterial products with the potential to function as a mucosal adjuvant ( Freytag and Clements , 2005 ) . 
Heat-labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin ( LT ) consists of A and B subunits . 
Subunit A confers toxicity by stimulating the cellular adenylate cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) system , and non-toxic pentameric subunit B binds to th monosialotetrahexosylganglioside ( GM1 ) ganglioside-receptor of the target cells to take up the whole toxin within the cell ( Fingerut et al. , 2006 ; Freytag and Clements , 2005 ) . 
LTB can enhance both mucosal and cell-mediated immunity through its reciprocal action with mammalian cells , which involves the stable cross-linking of GM1 at the mammalian cell surface ( Freytag and Clements , 2005 ) . 
LTB , however , is difﬁcult to prepare due to its structural complexity , including heat-lability , inclusion forms and stability ( Ma et al. , 2010 ) . 
In Salmonella Typhimurium ( ST ) , oral inoculation with recombinant live bacterial expression systems offered a promising method for the delivery of heterologous antigen , and has the advantage of not only inducing immune responses against bacteriostatic antigens , but also does not use antibiotic resistance markers ( Matic et al. , 2009 ) . 
In this study , we constructed a live LTB adjuvant strain , JOL1229 , harboring the eltB gene expressing the LTB protein carried by the recombinant Asd + plasmid , pJHL65 . 
Plasmid pJHL65 possesses the asparate - semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( asd ) gene,-lactamase signal sequence ( bla SS ) and pBR ori ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The bacterial essential asd gene , which acts as a balanced-lethal host-vector system , has been used to specify heterologous antigens from Asd + plasmids that are reserved in vivo in Salmonella vaccine strains with the asd gene deleted ( Kang et al. , 2002 ) . 
It is well known that - lactamase , encoded by the ampicillin resistance gene , is secreted into the periplasmic space of gram-negative bacteria ( Kang et al. , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , LTB protein expressed by the pJHL65-LTB vector with the bla SS system may be secreted more efﬁciently . 
In this study , a signiﬁcant intestinal sIgA response in the chickens immunized with a mixture consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 occurred during the third and fourth wpi ( Fig. 3B ) . 
The sIgA antibodies are a part of the ﬁrst defense barrier in the mucosal tissue against microorganisms through a mechanism called immune exclusion ( Corthesy , 2007 ) . 
Mucosal immunization , including oral administration , can be an effective means of inducing sIgA antibodies , as well as systemic antibodies and cellmediated immune responses ( Freytag and Clements , 2005 ) . 
In addition , the plasma IgG concentrations in all of the immunized groups were considerably higher compared to those in the control group ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The cell-mediated immune responses can be numerically expressed as a measurement of lymphocyte proliferation activity ( Rana and Kulshreshtha , 2006 ) . 
Signiﬁcant cell-mediated immune responses were detected in all the immunized groups compared with those in the control group according to the lymphocyte proliferation assay ( Fig. 4 ) . 
It is well known that cell-mediated immune responses are crucial in the late stages of a primary Salmonella infection ( Barrow , 2007 ; Hur and Lee , 2010 ) . 
All of these immunological data suggest that the LTB strain can effectively induce a level of acquired immunity , in particular , by signiﬁcantly enhancing the mucosal immune responses . 
Immunization with the JOL916 -- JOL1229 mixtures offered signiﬁcant protection in chickens challenged with the wild-type SG . 
Survival rates in all of the immunized groups of the chickens were considerably higher than those of the control group chickens ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In particular , the chickens immunized with a mixture consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 provided the most effective protection against acute and systemic FT infection . 
In addition , the gross lesion scores were signiﬁcantly different among the immunized and control groups ( Table 3 ) . 
Histopathological analysis also provided evidence of the protection efﬁcacy of the vaccination with the LTB strain . 
Virulent challenge of the unimmunized chickens caused the typical pathological changes associated with FT in the livers and spleens . 
In contrast , the chickens immunized with the LTB strain showed no pathological changes in the internal organs after the wild-type SG challenge ( Fig. 6 ) . 
These protection results seem to be most probably related to mucosal immune responses after vaccination with a ﬁxed quantity of LTB strain . 
In the present study , the peripheral blood lymphocyte populations were examined to gain more insight into the immunological effect of oral vaccination with LTB . 
The proportion of both CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes was signiﬁcantly higher in the chickens immunized with the four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 mixture than the unimmunized chickens , while increased CD8 + T-cell populations were observed in the chickens immunized with JOL916 alone ( Fig. 7 ) . 
CD4 + T-cells are essential for the production of antibody responses by providing help for the B-cells and can inﬂuence cytotoxic responses as well , whereas CD8 + T-cells are the effector cells in cytotoxic responses , killing infected target cells ( Arstila et al. , 1994 ) . 
Selective differentiation of lymphocyte populations was motivate by LTB protein , which is able to increase presentation in MHC class II molecules ( Bone et al. , 2002 ; Williams , 2000 ) . 
These data suggest that the potent adjuvanticity of LTB may be attributed to its ability to stimulate APCs of the mucosal immune system with reference to the upregulation of MHC II expression and CD4 + T-cell proliferation . 
Universally , T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells produce IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 and IL-10 , cytokines with a key role in inducing IgA expression ( Kramer et al. , 1995 ) . 
IL-4 is important for mucosal IgA induction , but it is not imperative if the antigen is administered by a live Salmonella delivery system ( Yamamoto et al. , 1996 ) . 
In the presence of a strong T helper 1 ( Th1 ) response induced by Salmonella , IL-5 , IL-6 and IL-10 from alternatives can act as a counterbalance to IL-4 ( Yang et al. , 2010 ) . 
In the present study , inoculation with JOL916 alone seemed to result in the down-regulation of IL-6 expression ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Generally , the induction of an IL-6 response may depend upon different serovars of S. enterica in chickens ; infection with the avian-speciﬁc serovar S. Gallinarum seems to result in the down-regulation or non-induction of IL-6 expression , unlike serovar S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis invasion in chicken cells ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ) . 
Immunization with the LTB strain , however , induced high levels of IL-6 mRNA expression in the splenocytes according to in vitro-speciﬁc soluble antigen exposure ( Fig. 8 ) . 
These data suggest that the use of LTB as a mucosal adjuvant induces Th2 cells to produce IL-6 . 
IL-6 was not only a more commanding inducer of IgA production by post-switched B-cell blasts than IL-5 , but can also create a synergy with IL-5 to promote an even higher level of IgA secretion by committed cells ( Kramer et al. , 1995 ) . 
Therefore , these results from the analyses of T-cell subpopulations and IL-6 mRNA expression support the idea that use of the LTB strain in oral vaccination can effectively stimulate mucosal immunity . 
feces , fecal samples were analyzed bacteriologically from days 1 to 7 post-vaccination . 
No LTB strains were isolated from the fecal samples from any chickens immunized with the mixture . 
The orally administered LTB strain was not excreted in the feces , thereby eliminating the potential for environmental contamination . 
Lesions in the liver and spleen , especially hepatosplenomegaly and necrotic foci on the surface of the tissues , form when SG replication is not sufﬁciently controlled by the immune system during Salmonella infection ( Chappell et al. , 2009 ) . 
No , or only minor , gross lesions were observed in the livers and spleens of the chickens immunized with the LTB strain ( Table 4 ) . 
This suggests that the LTB adjuvant strain may be safe for use in the host animal . 
Without major lesions in the internal organs and clinical symptoms , bacterial persistence in the organs due to the control of the immune system can assist in sustaining the well-developed immune circumstances of the body ( Chappell et al. , 2009 ) . 
Bacteriological recovery was observed in the chickens immunized with the LTB strain until the fourth wpi , but Salmonella was not isolated from either the liver or spleen samples at the fourth wpi ( Table 5 ) . 
These results indicate that the LTB strain successfully invaded the internal organs of the immunized chickens , enhanced their immune responses during the four weeks after inoculation , and may have been To examine whether the LTB strain was excreted in completely cleared from these organs by the ﬁfth week post-vaccination . 
In conclusion , the present data , including the activated humoral immune responses , the elevation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations and IL-6 mRNA expression , demonstrate that oral immunization with the LTB adjuvant strain can enhance acquired immunity , especially the mucosal immune responses , as well as effectively protect against FT. In addition , the evaluation of clinical signs , gross lesions , and bacterial recovery from internal organs indicates that immunization with the LTB strain may not induce side effects .

RNA samples were isolated from splenocytes stimulated with SG soluble antigen for 72 h , and used for real-time qRTPCR to determine the IL-6 mRNA levels . 
The data are fold changes in mRNA compared to the internal standard , GAPDH .
