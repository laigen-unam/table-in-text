Objectives : Mutants of ﬁve Salmonella enterica serovars were investigated for structural changes in regulatory regions known to be involved in the up-regulation of efﬂux pumps . 
Methods : Five Salmonella ﬁeld isolates and mutants , in which efﬂux pump inhibitor tests previously pointed towards an up-regulation of efﬂux , plus one negative control were included in the study . 
MIC values were determined of antibiotics that were indicative of AcrAB overexpression . 
The regulatory regions acrRA , soxRS , marORAB , acrSE and ramRA of original strains and mutants were sequenced and compared . 
The gene expression of acrA , tolC , ramA and soxS was assessed by quantitative realtime PCR . 
Conjugation experiments and tet gene PCRs were performed to explain unexpected variations in MIC values of tetracycline . 
Results : In four mutant strains , changes in the ramRA regulatory region , causing up-regulation of ramA , were detected . 
These changes comprised point mutations and deletions of 10 or 15 bp within the ramR gene and a single bp exchange located in the binding site of the RamR protein in Salmonella Infantis , Paratyphi and Livingstone mutants . 
An insertion of 49 bp within the soxR gene was involved in soxS up-regulation and enhanced efﬂux activity in the ﬁfth mutant from Salmonella Virchow . 
The loss of tetracycline resistance in one Salmonella Paratyphi mutant could be explained by the loss of a plasmid carrying a tet ( A ) gene . 
Conclusions : Changes in the ramR-ramA region as well as in the soxR gene occur in mutants of Salmonella serovars other than Typhimurium and seem to be involved in the up-regulation of efﬂux activity . 
Keywords : Salmonella enterica , efﬂux pumps , resistance 
Introduction
Resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones is believed to arise from an interplay of different resistance mechanisms , including mutations in topoisomerase genes , increased efﬂux via transporters , target site protection via Qnr proteins as well as enzymatic inactivation by Aac ( 60 ) - Ib-cr .1 -- 3 Although initial studies focused on the target gene mutations as the major mechanism of resistance , it became obvious during the past decade that active efﬂux plays a highly relevant role in ( ﬂuoro ) quinolone resistance . 
In Salmonella , decreased intracellular ( ﬂuoro ) quinolone accumulation via active efﬂux has been studied most extensively in isolates of the serovar Typhimurium and was mainly attributed to the overexpression of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efﬂux pump . 
4 Overproduction of this pump was considered to be responsible for a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype , which also includes resistance to tetracyclines and phenicols . 
4,5 Composite efﬂux pumps of the resistance -- nodulation -- division ( RND ) family , such as AcrAB-TolC , are under precise transcriptional control and expression of the pumps is subject to multiple levels of regulation . 
Expression of AcrAB is known to 6 be modulated by stress conditions as well as by global regulators such as MarA , SoxS or RamA . 
Furthermore , a local repres-6 -- 10 sor , AcrR , has been identiﬁed to play a role in the regulation of acrAB genes . 
In Salmonella , a mutation in the acrR gene was 11 reported to contribute to acrAB overexpression , as shown by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT -- PCR ) . 
Recently , RamR , the 12 local repressor of the gene ramA , was identiﬁed . 
Point mutations in ramR , which resulted in either amino acid exchanges or frame shifts , a deletion in the ramA promoter and also the inactivation of ramR by the insertion of an IS1 element have been proved to be involved in the up-regulation of efﬂux-mediated multidrug resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Although mutations 13,14 in the global regulators have recently been investigated in Salmonella Enteritidis , very little is known about the role of 15 ramR mutations or mutations in other regulatory genes , such as acrR , soxR , marR and acrS , that may inﬂuence AcrAB expression in Salmonella serovars other than Typhimurium . 
In a previous study , we analysed nalidixic acid-resistant and - susceptible isolates of different Salmonella serovars for their mutant prevention concentrations of ciproﬂoxacin . 
Besides 16 mutations in the target genes gyrA or gyrB , the results of studies with the efﬂux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-b-naphthylamide pointed towards the involvement of up-regulated efﬂux in the observed higher ( ﬂuoro ) quinolone MICs for the mutants . 
16 However , the molecular basis of this increased efﬂux was unknown . 
Therefore , it was the aim of this study to investigate the occurrence of structural changes in the aforementioned regulatory genes in selected mutants of Salmonella serovars Enteritidis , Infantis , Livingstone , Paratyphi B and Virchow .

Materials and methods
The origin of the three nalidixic acid-resistant and the two nalidixic acid-susceptible Salmonella ﬁeld isolates , and the generation of the respective mutants during a study to determine the mutant prevention concentrations have been described previously . 
In brief , mutants 16 were generated after 24 h of incubation on agar plates supplemented with 1 -- 128 the MIC of ciproﬂoxacin for the original isolate . 
One 16 mutant of each ﬁeld isolate was chosen for further investigations . 
MIC values of nalidixic acid , ciproﬂoxacin , tetracycline , ﬂorfenicol and chloramphenicol for the ﬁeld isolates and the corresponding mutants were determined by broth macrodilution . 
These antimicrobial agents were chosen because they belong to the substrate spectrum of AcrAB and their increased MICs pointed towards enhanced efﬂux via AcrAB . 
For MIC determination , Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 served as a reference strain for quality control purposes . 
All susceptibility tests were performed and evaluated according to the 17 18 CLSI guidelines M7-A7 and M100-S17 . 
The preparation of whole-cell DNA followed a previously 19 described protocol . 
Plasmid DNA from Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B isolate 5 and the respective mutant 3 was extracted and puriﬁed following a modiﬁcation of the alkaline lysis procedure . 
To conﬁrm the origin of the mutant , macrorestriction 19 analysis was conducted as described previously . 
To investigate the 19 localization of a tetracycline resistance gene in isolate Paratyphi B 5 , conjugation experiments were performed . 
For this , the rifampi-19 cin-resistant E. coli recipient strain HK225 was used and transconjugants were selected on agar plates containing 20 mg/L tetracycline and 100 mg/L rifampicin . 
The tet gene of isolate Paratyphi B 5 was identiﬁed by PCR assays as described previously . 
20 
To detect changes in the regions known to be involved in the regulation of the efﬂux pump AcrAB , we ampliﬁed the target regions acrRA , soxRS , marORAB , acrSE and ramRA using primers and PCR conditions described previously . 
Subsequent sequen-12 ,13,21 cing of the PCR products was performed on both strands by primer walking ( MWG-Biotech , Martinsried , Germany ) . 
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the ﬁeld isolates and their ciproﬂoxa-cin mutants were compared using the DNAMAN software ( Lynnon BioSoft , Quebec , Canada ) . 
To assess the gene expression of ramA , acrA , tolC and soxS , qRT -- PCR was performed . 
For that , overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth and grown to mid-logarithmic phase . 
Total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and contaminating genomic DNA was eliminated by DNase digestion ( RNase-Free DNase Set , Qiagen ) . 
RNA yield and quality were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Böblingen , Germany ) and , subsequently , cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 mg RNA templates using a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Qiagen ) . 
The absence of contaminating DNA was conﬁrmed by including reverse-transcription-minus controls . 
qRT -- PCR was carried out in a LightCycler 2.0 instrument ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) using a FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit ( Roche ) . 
Primers used PLUS for the qRT -- PCRs were : ramA f , 50-tttccgctcaggttatcgac-30 and r , 50-cgggcaatatcatcaatacg-30 14 0 ( 82 bp ) ; acrA f , 5 - tgtggaaccagtaatgccgtc-30 0 and r , 5 - gaagcaggagctggcaaatg-30 ( 252 bp , this study ) ; tolC f , 0 5 - tgccgcaactgggtttagg-30 and r , 50-cagagaagcgctggtttcattg-30 ( 92 bp , this study ) ; and soxS f , 50-tactcgcctaatgtttgatg-30 and r , 0 5 - aaatcgggctactccaag-30 ( 71 bp ) .14 As a reference gene , gyrB was ampliﬁed with the primers gyrB f , 50-tctcctcacagaccaaagataagct-30 and 0 r , 5 - cgctcagcagttcgttcatc-30 ( 81 bp ) . 
PCR conditions were 10 s at 958C , followed by 55 cycles of 958C for 10 s , 548C for 8 s and 728C for 12 s. Salmonella Enteritidis 9 and its mutant 1 , which did not exhibit changes in the MICs of phenicols and tetracycline ( Table 1 ) , were included in the qRT -- PCR analysis as negative controls . 
The qRT -- PCR experiments were performed three times independently , and the relative expression software tool ( REST ) was used for the calculation and analysis of qRT -- PCR results .

Results and discussion
Antimicrobial susceptibility of ﬁeld isolates and corresponding mutants
Previous investigations of the quinolone resistance determining regions ( QRDRs ) of these mutants have shown that only mutants from formerly nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates developed single mutations in the topoisomerase gene gyrA ( Table 1 ) , while mutants from formerly nalidixic acid-resistant isolates exhibited only the alteration in gyrA that was already present in the original isolate . 
The results of studies with efﬂux pump 16 inhibitors suggested that enhanced efﬂux activity might play a role in the elevated MICs of ciproﬂoxacin for mutants derived 16 from these latter isolates . 
To further investigate the role of enhanced efﬂux activity , the MIC values of tetracycline , ﬂorfenicol and chloramphenicol were determined . 
These antimicrobial agents were reported to be substrates of the AcrAB efﬂux 5 pump . 
A 2 - to 16-fold increase in the MICs of these antimicrobial agents was detected in ﬁve mutants ( Table 1 ) . 
The observed changes in the MIC values between the original strain and its respective mutant were seen regardless of nalidixic acid resist-ance or susceptibility of the original strain , and this observation suggested that enhanced efﬂux may occur independently of alterations in gyrA already present in the original isolates . 
Only for the mutant strain derived from isolate Salmonella Paratyphi B 5 was a striking decrease in the tetracycline MIC value detected ( Table 1 ) , and was the subject of further investigations .

Tetracycline resistance gene in Salmonella Paratyphi B 5
Since the original isolate Salmonella Paratyphi B 5 was tetracycline-resistant in contrast to its mutant 3 ( Table 1 ) , macro-restriction analysis was performed and conﬁrmed the origin of the mutant strain . 
Plasmid proﬁling identiﬁed three plasmids of 
2.1 , 5.8 and .54.0 kb in the original isolate , of which the largest plasmid was lost in the mutant strain . 
Conjugation experiments in combination with PCR assays conﬁrmed that a tetracycline resistance gene of hybridization class A , tet ( A ) , was located on the .54.0 kb plasmid . 
Characterization of mutations in ramR-ramA and other efﬂux pump regulatory regions , and expression analysis of ramA , 
Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the acrRA , soxRS , marORAB , acrSE and ramRA regions of original strains and their mutants detected changes in the ramRA and soxRS regions of ﬁve mutants . 
Five sequence alterations were located in the ramA upstream region , four of which were detected in ramR and one in the noncoding region between ramA and its repressor gene ( Figure 1a ) . 
In the mutant of Salmonella Livingstone 3 , a single bp exchange , leading to the amino acid exchange R46P in RamR , was present . 
Other changes in ramR comprised deletions of 10 or 15 nucleo-tides in the Salmonella Infantis 1 and the Salmonella Paratyphi B 10 mutant strains ( Figure 1a ) . 
These deletions generated either an early stop codon ( Salmonella Infantis 1 mutant 2 ) or caused the loss of ﬁve amino acids ( Salmonella Paratyphi B 10 mutant 2 ) , respectively . 
The aforementioned structural alterations differed from those reported in Salmonella Typhimurium or Enteritidis and suggested that sequence alterations may 13 -- 15 occur at various positions in the ramR gene . 
In Salmonella Paratyphi B 10 mutant 2 , an additional alteration in the ramR gene was detected . 
This alteration comprised a single bp exchange , GAA!GAC , which resulted in the amino acid exchange E160D . 
A stop codon at position 160 has already been described in ramR in Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Both mutations 13 detected in Salmonella Livingstone 3 mutant 2 and Salmonella Infantis 1 mutant 2 increased the ramA expression 34.3 - and 41.6-fold in comparison with the original strains ( Table 1 ) , whereas the two changes occurring in Salmonella Paratyphi B 10 mutant 2 led to a higher increase ( 94.8-fold ) in the expression of the ramA gene . 
Minor increases in acrA and tolC expression were also observed in all three mutant strains and ranged from 4.5 - to 7.4-fold ( for acrA ) and from 2.0 - to 8.0-fold ( for tolC ) . 
Another point mutation , C!A , was located between the ramA gene and its repressor gene in mutant 3 of Salmonella Paratyphi B 5 ( Figure 1a ) . 
This exchange was located exactly in one of the inverted repeated sequences formerly described as the RamR binding site and , thus , might result in impaired 13 binding of RamR . 
This was conﬁrmed by the relative expression analysis of ramA , whereby an increase of 10.0-fold ( Table 1 ) could be detected . 
Although this up-regulation of ramA was considerably lower than the up-regulation due to mutations in ramR , decreases in antimicrobial susceptibility suggested that this point mutation is also able to enhance AcrAB-TolC efﬂux activity . 
A similar observation was made by Zheng et al. , who detected 14 a 9 bp deletion in the ramA promoter region that led to activation of RamA in a single Salmonella Typhimurium strain . 
Four-fold increases in the MICs of chloramphenicol and ﬂorfenicol suggested an overexpression of the AcrAB efﬂux pump in the Salmonella Virchow 2 mutant strain 1 . 
In that mutant , an insertion of 49 bp was located after nucleotide position 149 within the soxR gene ( Figure 1b ) . 
This insertion generated an early stop after codon 57 . 
Analysis of the inserted region revealed that 33 of the 49 bp represented a duplication of the upstream nucleotide sequence . 
Although changes in the soxRS locus have been reported only rarely in Salmonella , exchanges 12 in soxR have already been described to contribute to quinolone resistance in a clinical Salmonella Typhimurium isolate as well as in single in vitro mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis . 
Nevertheless , none of the soxRS 9,14,15 mutations described before resulted in a similarly high up-regulation of soxS ( by 323.1-fold ) as observed in the Salmonella Virchow 2 mutant strain 1 ( Table 1 ) . 
In the remaining Salmonella Enteritidis mutant , which was included as a negative control , no changes in the regulatory regions could be detected . 
This result was in good accordance with the comparison of MIC values . 
The mutant exhibited MICs of tetracycline , chloramphenicol and ﬂorfenicol that were indistinguishable from the MICs of the original isolate ( Table 1 ) and , hence , an up-regulated efﬂux via AcrAB was not expected . 
This suggestion was conﬁrmed by the relative expression analysis of acrA , ramA , tolC and soxS , where only slight differences in expression ratios compared with the original strain could be different alterations in the ramR-ramA region as well as in the soxR gene lead to an AcrAB up-regulation and that they also
