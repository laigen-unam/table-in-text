Abstract 
Hybridomas secreting immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) against Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) were generated after mucosal immunization of BALB/c mice with heat killed bacteria . 
Antigen binding properties and specificity of the produced MAbs were studied in ELISA and immunoblotting with purified LPS . 
Two IgA MAbs agglutinated all Salmonella OD1 strains and all S. enteritidis clinical isolates . 
MAb 178H11 recognized O :9 antigen of subserogroup OD1 LPS . 
MAb 177E6/A9 reacted also with OD3 LPS antigen and agglutinated OD3 strains . 
These data suggest the existence of different O :9 antigen subspecificities , one presented in subgroup OD1 and the other common for OD1 and OD3 . 
Thus the produced IgA MAbs prove to be useful reagents , which could differentiate OD1 and OD3 from OD2 strains .

1. Introduction
Serological identi cents cation and classi cents cation of Salmonella is based on their O and H antigens according to the scheme of Kau ¡ mann ^ White [ 1 ] . 
Salmonella species are subdivided in di ¡ erent serogroups by their lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) antigen speci cents cities [ 2 ] . 
A variety of O antigens had been determined by cross absorption of rabbit agglutinating sera . 
Salmonella isolates can be identi cents ed and grouped by slide agglutination test [ 3 ] . 
Preparation of MAbs directed to O and H antigens has been reported [ 4 ^ 8 ] . 
MAbs with their monoepitopic speci cents city have many advantages over monospeci cents c polyclonal sera . 
Sal-monella strains which present LPS O :9 antigen are uni cents ed in group OD . 
MAbs strongly reacting with LPS of group OD1 Salmonella were established as useful reagents for identi cents cation of this serogroup and for di ¡ erentiation of 
OD1 and OD2 strains , which have identical # agellar H antigens [ 9 ] . 
Important pathogens Salmonella typhi ( 9,12 [ Vi ] ; d - ) and Salmonella enteritidis ( 1,9,12 ; g , m - ) belong to serogroup OD and di ¡ erent assays using MAbs are developed to detect their antigens [ 8 ^ 10 ] . 
The MAbs used for diagnostic purposes are mainly of IgG and IgM isotypes . 
There are several reports about production of hybridoma cell lines secreting IgA MAbs , which bound bacterial surface antigens [ 11,12 ] . 
IgA antibodies are the principal mucosal antibody class produced by local plasma cells , which enter as dimeric or polymeric forms into the secretions via speci cents c polymeric immunoglobulin receptormediated transport . 
They form the cents rst line of immune defense against infection , including Salmonella infection , by their ability to inhibit attachment of microorganisms and their toxins to the mucosal surfaces [ 13 ] . 
Thus IgA MAbs are used mainly to clarify the mechanisms of local immune defense [ 14 ^ 18 ] . 
However , their possible application as serotyping reagents has not been assessed and their diagnostic potential has not been compared with that of the available IgG and IgM diagnostic MAbs . 
There are two main strategies to obtain IgA isotype MAbs : by fusion of myeloma line cells with Payer 's patches lympho-blasts after mucosal immunization with live microorganisms and by isolation of IgA isotype switch variants of IgG and IgM hybridomas [ 15,19 ] . 
In this study we characterized two IgA MAbs generated after fusion between spleen lymphoblasts and myeloma cells after intragastral immunization with heat killed bacteria .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and antigen preparation
Salmonella laboratory strains used in this study were obtained from the Collection of Institute Pasteur , Paris , France and the National Microbiological Collection , So - cents a , Bulgaria . 
Fifty-seven S. enteritidis clinical isolates were con cents rmed by routine biochemical and serological methods . 
The bacteria were grown overnight on trypticase soy agar . 
Highly virulent for mice S. enteritidis clinical isolate ( LD50 6 10 bacteria after intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) application ) was used for immunization . 
S-form LPS were extracted by the hot phenol ^ water method of Westphal [ 20 ] from Salmonella strains of di ¡ erent serogroups . 
Puri cents ed LPS from Salmonella typhimurium ( O :1,4,5,12 ) , S. enteritidis ( O :1,9,12 ) , Salmonella minnesota Ra ( strain R60 ) and lipid A were kindly provided by C. Galanos , Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology , Frei-burg , Germany . 
All LPS preparations were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg ml31 in distilled water and neutralized with triethylamine if necessary . 
2.2. Production of MAbs
Eight weeks old BALB/c mice were immunized intragastrally ( i.g. ) daily for 4 weeks with 5U109 heat killed bacteria in 0.5 ml carbonate bicarbonate bu ¡ er pH 9.6 . 
After the last application the animals were bled from the retroorbital venous plexus and sera were tested by ELISA . 
Two weeks later one mouse was boosted intravenously ( i.v. ) with 1U109 bacteria and another one was boosted i.g. with 10U109 bacteria . 
Three days afterwards spleen cells were harvested and fused with P3X63-Ag8 .653 mye-loma cells in two separated fusions according to the meth-od of Ko `` hler and Milstein [ 21,22 ] . 
Supernatants of produced hybridomas were tested by ELISA and isotyped by antigen-mediated ELISA using ISO-2 kit ( Sigma ) . 
Two IgA producing hybridomas reacting in slide agglutination test were grown in serum-free medium ( Sigma ) . 
Ascitic # uids were obtained after i.p. injection of 10U106 hybrid-oma cells in pristine primed BALB/c mice . 
nium sulfate precipitation by 45 % ( vol/vol ) saturation and by cold ethanol precipitation . 
Precipitated MAbs were dissolved in 20 mM Tris ^ HCl bu ¡ er and fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q HR 5/5 column ( Pharmacia ) . 
Puri cents ed MAbs were equilibrated to 1.3 mg ml31 concentration and stabilized by addition of 1 % BSA . 
Serum-free supernatants were precipitated via dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate to 45 % ( vol/vol ) and dialyzed against phosphate-bu ¡ ered saline ( PBS ) . 
Production of monomeric , dimeric and polymeric IgA forms was con cents rmed by SDS ^ PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and by immuno-blotting . 
2.4. Slide agglutination test (SAT)
Slide agglutination was performed by mixing 20 Wl of antibody solution ( undiluted or serially diluted ) with bacteria grown on solid media and the results were read in 1 min . 
2.5. Passive hemagglutination and passive hemolysis
Microtest version of the passive hemolysis ( PH ) described by Galanos [ 23 ] was used . 
Hemolysis titers ( the last dilution at which approximately 50 % hemolysis occurred ) were determined after incubation for 1 h at 37 ³ C and overnight at 4 ³ C. Passive hemagglutination ( PHA ) was performed in the same way as PH but without adding of complement . 
The last dilution with hemagglutination was considered as a titer . 
2.6. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
A sensitive antigen-mediated ELISA [ 24 ] with puri cents ed LPS was performed . 
Goat anti-mouse Ig ( G , A , M ) peroxidase conjugated antibody ( Sigma ) was used as a secondary antibody . 
MAbs were isotyped by antigen-medi-ated ELISA performed according to the ISO-2 kit producer 's protocol ( Sigma ) . 
2.7. Sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS^PAGE) and immunoblotting
SDS ^ PAGE of LPS was carried out according to the method of Laemmli [ 25 ] and the separated LPS were stained by silver staining [ 26 ] . 
Immunoblotting of fractionated LPS was performed by the method of Towbin [ 27 ] . 
LPS were transferred from separating gels to nitrocellulose membranes ( pores of 0.45 Wm , Schleicher and Schuell ) for 1 h at 0.8 mA î cm32 with Bio-Rad semi-dry blotting device . 
After blocking with 3 % bovine serum albumin in PBS the membranes were incubated with supernatants over-night at 4 ³ C. IgA MAbs bound to the LPS bands were visualized with goat anti-mouse ( K-chain speci cents c ) peroxidase conjugated antibody and 4-chloro-1-naphtol as a substrate . 
To detect monomeric and polymeric IgA forms puri cents ed MAbs were resolved by SDS ^ PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and the separated proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining . 
Immunoblotting of puri cents ed IgA MAbs was performed using the same protocol . 
2.3 . 
Puri cents cation of the IgA MAbs 
MAbs from ascites were partially puri cents ed by ammo ¬ 
2.8. Indirect immuno£uorescent assay (IFA)
Microscope slides were coated with S. enteritidis , airdried and cents xed in cold ( 320 ³ C ) acetone . 
The slides were incubated with puri cents ed MAbs for 1 h at 37 ³ C in humid atmosphere . 
After three washes in PBS , FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody ( Sigma ) was added for 30 min and the samples were examined with # uorescent microscope . 
2.9. Tests for detection of secretory IgA (sIgA)
Hybridoma 177E6 was grown as ` backpack ' tumor by subcutaneous injection of 5U106 cells in PBS on the upper back of BALB/c mice as described [ 14,15 ] . 
Two weeks later serum , bile and gut samples from mice with visible tumors were collected and tested by SAT and by antigenmediated ELISA using puri cents ed 177E6 MAb as a standard . 
In the other set of experiments puri cents ed MAbs 177E6 and 178H11 were injected i.v. , the samples were collected 8 h later and tested in the same way .

Two bands corresponding to heavy ( 55 kDa ) and light ( 25 kDa ) chain are visualized . 
Molecular size Sigma markers ( kDa ) are shown . 
2.10. Tests for stability
Puri cents ed IgA MAbs and supernatants containing 0.1 % NaN3 were tested by SAT , PHA and ELISA after exposure to di ¡ erent temperatures : 56 ³ C for 1 h , 37 ³ C for 2 weeks , 2 ^ 8 ³ C or at room temperature ( 18 ³ C ) for 1 year . 
Repeated fast freezing and thawing was used to test puri - cents ed MAbs stabilized with 1 % BSA in PBS . 
Diluted in PBS ascites or undiluted supernatants were mixed 1:1 ( vol/vol ) with freshly prepared 10 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) solution for detection of antibody stability in the presence of reducing agents . 
The samples were incubated at 37 ³ C for 2 h and the speci cents c activity was measured by PHA and SAT . 
IgA stability was examined after exposure to di ¡ erent pH values . 
Puri cents ed MAbs were diluted in acetate bu ¡ - er pH 5.2 and carbonate bicarbonate bu ¡ er pH 10.0 , stored for several days at 2 ^ 8 ³ C and after overnight dialyzation against PBS the antibody activity was measured . 
3. Results
3.1. Production of MAbs
After the cents rst period of oral immunization sera of the immunized mice demonstrated speci cents c IgA reactivity only in ELISA with S. enteritidis LPS . 
Following reimmunization course , increasing titers of the speci cents c serum IgA antibodies were observed in cents ve animals . 
Two of them with agglutinating titer 1:8 were selected and boostered . 
Fusion with spleen cells of mouse with cents nal i.g. boost gave no rise of antigen speci cents c hybridomas . 
In contrast , high yield of S. enteritidis LPS-reactive hybridomas was obtained after fusion with spleen cells of the mouse with cents nal i.v. boost . 
Culture supernatants were screened by ELISA and 12 hybridoma clones were isolated and isotyped . 
Eight clones secreted IgA , two clones IgM , one clone IgG2a and one clone IgG2b MAbs . 
Two of the IgA hybridomas ( 177E6 and 178H11 ) secreting agglutinating antibodies were selected for detailed characterization . 
3.2. Puri¢cation of IgA MAbs
The cents rst precipitation step led to partial puri cents cation of IgA from ascites . 
Ammonium sulfate precipitation decreased agglutination activity more than two times . 
In contrast cold ethanol precipitation did not lead to decrease of activity . 
On the anion-exchange Mono Q column IgA was fractionated in one peak and the separation of the monomeric , dimeric and polymeric IgA forms was not possible . 
Single step ammonium sulfate puri cents cation of se-rum-free supernatants was e $ cient without signi cents cant waste of activity . 
Analysis by SDS ^ PAGE under reducing condition showed only two bands of heavy and light chains after Coomassie staining ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Under non-reduc-ing condition the polymeric IgA formed two bands with high molecular mass ( MM over 205 kDa marker band ) and the monomeric form migrated as a single band ( MM approximately 110 kDa ) . 
Subsequent immunoblotting with mouse K-chain speci cents c peroxidase conjugated antibody con cents rmed that bands were monomeric and polymeric IgA forms ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Under reducing condition only one band corresponding to heavy K-chain ( MM approximately 55 kDa ) was visualized ( Fig. 2C ) . 
3.3. Characterization of IgA MAbs
IgA MAbs were found to react with LPS from Salmo-nella serogroup OD1 in PHA and ELISA and to agglutinate all OD1 strains , including 57 clinical isolates of S. enteritidis ( Table 1 ) . 
Antibody 177E6 reacted in addition with strains and LPS from subserogroup OD3 . 
The MAbs did not recognize Salmonella OD2 antigen . 
Cross-reactiv-ity with LPS of other serogroups ( A to O :67 ) and LPS of complete core rough mutant S. minnesota R60 ( Ra chemotype ) and with puri cents ed lipid A was not detected . 
The capacity of IgA MAbs to agglutinate bacteria was demonstrated in SAT using puri cents ed MAbs in serial dilutions starting from 10 Wg ml31 . 
Concentration of 1.25 Wg ml31 of IgA MAb 177E6 was su $ cient to agglutinate bacteria . 
Both MAbs produced bright # uorescence with all OD1 strains used in IFA ( Table 1 ) . 
LPS from smooth strains analyzed by SDS ^ PAGE showed characteristic ladder-like pattern after silver staining ( Fig. 3A ) . 
After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and subsequent immunoblotting both agglutinating IgA MAbs reacted with high molecular mass bands corresponding to the O antigen of group OD1 ( Fig. 3B , C ) . 
MAb 177E6 reacted also with OD3 LPS antigen ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Both IgA MAbs were strongly speci cents c for S. ente-ritidis in immuno # uorescent assay . 
Although IgA MAbs showed considerable agglutinating capacity in PHA they did not react in PH ( Table 1 ) . 
Speci cents c sIgA MAb was found in serum , bile and gut samples of mice bearing hybridoma 177E6 as subcutane-ous tumor as well as in the samples after i.v. injection of both IgA MAbs . 
Exposure of the IgA MAbs to di ¡ erent temperatures did not decrease signi cents cantly their activity compared to the control IgG MAb as measured by PHA ( Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , the agglutinating activity of control IgM MAb was signi cents cantly decreased after exposure for 1 h at 56 ³ C and at room temperature ( 18 ³ C ) for 6 months . 
Di ¡ erent pH values and repeated freezing and thawing procedure also did not a ¡ ect IgA activity . 
The reducing agent DTT completely abolished the activity of IgA and IgM but not of IgG MAbs .

( A ) MAb 178H11 under non-reducing condition ; ( B ) MAb 177E6 under non-reducing condition ; and ( C ) MAb 177E6 under reducing condition . 
Monomeric IgA forms of both MAbs correspond to band with MM 110 kDa . 
Dimeric and polymeric forms are presented as two bands for 178H11 and one band for 177E6 with MM over 205 kDa marker band . 
For 177E6 only one single band corresponding to K-heavy chain ( MM 55 kDa ) appears under reducing condition . 
Molecular size markers ( Gibco ) are indicated in kDa .

4. Discussion
The presented data demonstrate the production and characterization of two anti-LPS MAbs of IgA isotype . 
Production of IgA hybridomas requires mucosal application of antigen and the classical immunization protocols need modi cents cation . 
To produce IgA secreting hybridomas live low virulent or avirulent for mice strains are used for i.g. immunization and Payer 's patches were the source of cells for fusion [ 12,15,17 ] . 
In the present work modi cents ed immunization protocol was applied because highly virulent for mice S. enteritidis strain was used . 
The mice were immunized i.g. with heat killed bacteria for prolonged time . 
The induced immune response shows that this approach is reasonable when highly virulent strain is used for immunization . 
Preliminary experiments indicated that immunization with killed bacteria did not evoke signi cents cant stimulation and enlargement of the Payer 's patches as in the case of immunization with live bacteria . 
Thus the Payer 's patches were not an adequate cell source for fusion in this case . 
As a possible alternative , spleen cells were used for fusion after i.v. or i.g. cents nal boost . 
Obtaining of hybridomas with prevalence of IgA isotype producing clones proved the adequacy of this approach . 
No speci cents c hybridoma was generated after i.g. boost . 
The good yield of speci cents c hybridomas and prevalence of IgA secreting clones after i.v. boost supports the concept that IgA switched B-cells settle in the spleen after mucosal contact with antigen . 
Thus spleen cells are reasonable fusion partners when IgA secreting hybridomas are the aim , but cents nal i.v. immunization is necessary . 
The produced IgA MAbs were speci cents c for the OD group antigen as shown in all immunological reactions with LPS of S. enteritidis ( Table 1 ) . 
Two of the MAbs with strong agglutinating ability were interesting for detailed characterization of their speci cents city and biological properties , including protective activity . 
The absence of cross-reactivity with strains from serogroups A to O :67 , Ra LPS and lipid A indicate that MAbs carry O :9 specif-icity . 
Antigen O :9 is de cents ned as serogroup OD speci cents c factor . 
The other presented O antigens subdivide the OD strains into three subserogroups : OD1 ( 1,9,12 ) , OD2 ( 9,46 ) and OD3 ( 1,9,12,27,46 ) . 
Production and possible diagnostic applications of anti-OD MAbs have been reported [ 6 ] . 
However their speci cents cities for subgroups OD1 , OD2 and OD3 and the possible existence of O :9 subspeci cents cities are not discussed . 
Subspeci cents cities are described in some Salmonella serotypes such as factor O :3 , O :4 , O :6 and recently for O :7 [ 5,28 ] . 
Our cents ndings suggest expression of at least three di ¡ erent subspeci cents cities ( epitopes ) of 0:9 antigen . 
One subspeci cents city is presented only in OD1 O :9 antigen as shown by reaction of MAb 178H11 with strains and LPS of serogroup OD1 but not of OD2 and OD3 . 
Reaction of MAb 177E6 with strains and LPS of subgroups OD1 and OD3 suggests the existence of common OD1 and OD3 subspeci cents city . 
The common Sal-monella OD epitope was demonstrated by MAbs in another study by us ( manuscript in preparation ) . 
Evaluation of the IgA forms secreted from both hybrid-omas and preparation of IgA standard need precise puri - cents cation . 
IgA puri cents cation is more di $ cult than IgG and some procedures are intended for that . 
In our hand cold ethanol precipitation was suitable as a cents rst step for IgA puri cents cation from ascites and revealed minimal losses of MAb activity in comparison with ammonium sulfate precipitation . 
This method is simple to perform but needs a subsequent puri cents cation step by other techniques such as a $ nity - , gel - or ion-exchange chromatography [ 21 ] . 
Anion-exchange columns Mono Q supply good yield of pure IgA MAbs , which is con cents rmed by electrophoresis under reducing condition ( Fig. 1 ) . 
However , separation of monomeric and polymeric IgA is not possible in this way . 
Single step puri cents cation of IgA MAbs from serumfree supernatants by ammonium sulfate precipitation is e $ cient . 
SDS ^ PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting of the puri cents ed IgA MAbs con cents rmed the production of di-meric and polymeric IgA forms . 
Molecular structure of IgA shows some di ¡ erences with conventional immuno-globulin structure . 
In BALB/c mice , the light chains might be disul cents de bonded to each other but not to the heavy chains [ 29 ] and this could explain the existence of bands corresponding to heavy-heavy chain dimers with MM 110 kDa ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Under used experimental conditions both IgA MAbs showed high stability , comparable to IgG and greater than IgM Salmonella speci cents c agglutinating MAbs ( Table 2 ) . 
These cents ndings suggest that the IgA MAbs are suitable for preparation of reagents for serotyping of Salmonella isolates . 
Preliminary experiments to de cents ne biological function were performed as a part of the complete characterization of the produced MAbs . 
The negative results of PH test con cents rmed the lack of complement activation properties of IgA antibodies . 
Speci cents c secretory IgA detected in biological # uids after growing of hybridoma 177E6 as ` backpack ' tumor and after i.v. injection of puri cents ed MAbs veri - cents ed that both hybridomas secrete polymeric IgA . 
This makes them suitable for examination of biological properties of sIgA , including their protective potential in experimental Salmonella infection .
