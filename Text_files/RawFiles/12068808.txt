Summary
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium periodically experiences acid stress in a variety of host and non-host environments . 
An encounter with non-lethal acid stress ( pH > 4 ) induces an assortment of physiological changes , called the acid tolerance response ( ATR ) , that helps the cell to tolerate extreme low pH ( pH 3 ) . 
These physiological changes differ in log phase and stationary phase cells and are controlled by different regulatory proteins . 
OmpR is an acid-induced response regulator critical to the stationary phase ATR but not to the log phase ATR . 
As OmpR also controls the expression of the acid-induced virulence operon ssrAB , acid shock induction of ompR was examined to gain insight into how Salmonella links virulence with survival at extreme acid pH. The results indicate that acid pH induces ompR from a promoter different from that used for basal expression . 
Transcription from this promoter is repressed by the histone-like protein H-NS and requires OmpR-P for induction . 
The classic sensor kinase EnvZ and acetyl phosphate collaborate to produce the optimum level of OmpR-P needed for autoinduction . 
Although OmpR-P is required for acid-induced expression of ompR in wild-type cells , OmpR is not needed for ompR transcription in the absence of H-NS . 
Thus , the role of OmpR-P in autoinduction is to help to counteract repression by H-NS . 
This evidence , combined with the ﬁnding that relaxing DNA supercoiling with novobiocin also increased ompR transcription , suggests that acid stress induces ompR by altering local

Introduction
The impact of acidic pH on the pathogenesis of Salmonella is profound . 
For example , the infectious dose for Salmo-nella species , including Salmonella typhi , is signiﬁcantly decreased if stomach acidity is buffered ( Hornick et al. , 1970 ; Blaser and Newman , 1982 ) . 
This suggests that the better prepared an organism is to tolerate acid , the more likely it will survive passage through the stomach and cause disease . 
Although stomach acidity is a barrier that must be breached , the less severe acid pH present in the macrophage phagolysosome environment , while not a threat to survival , is an important virulence signal , evoking the synthesis of numerous virulence factors ( Rathman et al. , 1996 ; Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Beuz et al. , 1999 ) . 
Early evidence suggesting that low pH plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella typhimurium triggered a series of studies to explore how this organism senses and adapts to acid stress ( reviewed by Foster and Moreno , 1999 ; Foster , 1999 ) . 
The results indicate that the organism undergoes a remarkable molecular response to acid pH that provides tolerance to many different stress conditions . 
Salmonella typhimurium growing at pH 7.7 ( minimal medium ) die rapidly when shifted to conditions below pH 3.5 ( acid challenge ) . 
However , adapting organisms to mild acid before severe acid challenge increases tolerance , enabling a 1000-fold improvement in survival over a 2 h period at pH 3 ( Foster and Hall , 1990 ) . 
This inducible acid survival system , called the acid tolerance response ( ATR ) , requires protein synthesis and a series of acid shock proteins ( ASPs ) induced upon shifts below pH 5 . 
There are two distinct ATR systems classiﬁed as log phase ATR and stationary phase ATR . 
Each system is deﬁned by distinctly different sets of ASPs and separate regulators controlling ASP production and acid tolerance ( Foster , 1991 ; 1993 ; Lee et al. , 1994 ; 1995 ) . 
One system is induced in exponentially growing cells subjected to an acid shock , whereas the other is evident after acid treatment of stationary phase cells . 
Regulators such as rpoS and fur , required to control log phase ATR ( Lee et al. , 1995 ; Hall and Foster , 1996 ) , have little effect on the stationary phase , acid-inducible ATR ( Lee et al. , 1994 ) .

Recently , a brute force screening method was used to identify several MudJ insertion mutants selectively defective in the stationary phase ATR ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
Although lacking the stationary phase ATR , these mutants exhibited normal log phase acid tolerance . 
Sequence analysis of the Mu junctions revealed that two of the insertions occurred within the regulatory gene ompR . 
The ompR product is part of a classic two-component signal transduction system in which EnvZ is the membrane-bound sensor kinase and OmpR is the response regulator ( Mizuno and Mizushima , 1990 ) . 
EnvZ appears to sense a variety of environmental signals , the most actively studied being osmolarity . 
Upon sensing a signal , EnvZ phosphorylates itself at histidine residue 243 ( Igo and Silhavy , 1988 ; Roberts et al. , 1994 ) and then transfers the phosphate to aspartate 55 of OmpR ( Delgado et al. , 1993 ) . 
Phosphorylated OmpR then binds and activates target genes such as those encoding the outer membrane porins OmpC and OmpF . 
As one might predict , unphosphorylated OmpR is not sufﬁcient to induce the stationary phase ATR , phosphorylation is critical . 
Mutants lacking two major OmpR phosphodonors , EnvZ and acetyl phosphate , are acid sensitive . 
However , this phenotype is suppressed by converting OmpR residue D55 ( the phosphorylation site ) to a glutamate . 
The D55E mutation mimics phosphorylation and results in a constitutively active OmpR protein that does not require phosphorylation to activate target genes . 
This result indicates that phosphorylated OmpR is required for stationary phase-dependent , acid-induced acid tolerance . 
We have also demonstrated that OmpR is itself an acid shock protein thought to be induced at the transcriptional level ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
The model developed from those studies was that acid shock induces the production of OmpR , which , in its phosphorylated state , can trigger the expression of genes needed for acid-induced stationary phase acid tolerance . 
How acid shock regulated ompR transcription was not examined . 
Before this study , potential environmental control over ompR expression was not examined extensively even though OmpR is an important Salmonella virulence factor ( Bernardini et al. , 1990 ; Chatﬁeld et al. , 1991 ; Lindgren et al. , 1996 ) . 
What has been reported is that CRP and cAMP in Escherichia coli affect ompR transcription from four potential start sites ( Huang et al. , 1992 ) . 
Two of the transcripts are negatively regulated by CRP-cAMP , whereas the other two are positively regulated by this complex . 
In addition , integration host factor ( IHF ) has been shown to bind to the promoter region and inhibit transcription ( Tsui et al. , 1991 ) . 
However , the ompR regulatory region in S. typhimurium is unique relative to its E. coli counterpart in both sequence and function ( Liljestrom et al. , 1988 ; Puente et al. , 1991 ; Martinez-Flores et al. , 1999 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Although E. coli ompR is transcribed from four promoters , two strong and two weak , S. typhimurium ompR is reportedly transcribed from only a single promoter ( Liljestrom et al. , 1988 ; Tsui et al. , 1991 ) . 
In this paper , we examine the details of ompR induction by low pH and the potential roles of alternative OmpR phosphodonors in acid tolerance .

Results
Acid, but not osmotic, stress induces ompR
In E. coli , OmpR is clearly involved in the cellular response to osmotic stress , mediating the reciprocal osmotic control of ompC and ompF ( Hall and Silhavy , 1981 ; Slauch and Silhavy , 1989 ; Tate et al. , 1988 ; Lan and Igo , 1998 ) . 
In contrast , the Salmonella ompC porin gene is not osmoregulated , even though the expression of both ompC and ompF still require OmpR ( Puente et al. , 1991 ; Martinez-Flores et al. , 1999 ) . 
Nevertheless , the ompC genes in both organisms are induced by acid in an OmpR-dependent manner ( Thomas and Booth , 1992 ; Foster et al. , 1994 ; Heyde et al. , 2000 ; Sato et al. , 2000 ) . 
Because of the historical connection between osmolarity and OmpR in E. coli , we examined whether OmpR levels in Salmonella might increase in response to osmolarity as well as they do to acid shock . 
The results presented in Fig. 2A reveal that OmpR levels increased most notably in acid-shocked stationary phase cells . 
Although less pronounced , an acid shock induction of OmpR was also demonstrated in log phase cells ( Fig. 2B ) . 
In contrast , OmpR levels did not increase in response to osmotic shock in exponential ( data not shown ) or in stationary phase cells , but actually decreased relative to untreated cells ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This decrease occurred with NaCl ( Fig. 2 ) or sucrose as the osmolyte ( data not shown ) .

B. Exponentially growing cells ( OD600 = 0.4 ) in EG pH 7.7 medium were acidiﬁed by HCl to pH 4.4 , and periodic samples were taken for analysis . 
Total cellular proteins ( 5 mg ) were electrophoresed in a 10 % SDS -- PAGE gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis . 
OmpR autoregulates its own expression
The ompR promoter region in Salmonella contains three potential OmpR binding sites located at -- 33 bp ( R1 ) , -- 97 bp ( R2 ) and -- 138 bp ( R3 ) from the AUG start codon ( Fig. 1 ) . 
These sites are most homologous to the E. coli OmpR binding site F1 ( 5 cents - ACTTTTGGTTACATATTT ) for ompF , matching at 10 ( R1 ) , 11 ( R2 ) and nine ( R3 ) out of 18 bases . 
This observation raised the possibility that OmpR controls its own expression . 
To explore this + hypothesis , ompR / ompR -- lacZ and ompR/ompR -- lacZ merodiploid strains were constructed . 
As described in Experimental procedures , an ompR -- lacZ operon fusion was placed within the putPA operon on the Salmonella chromosome . 
The fusion contained 283 bp of DNA upstream of the ompR translational start including all areas suspected of participating in ompR control . 
The results presented in Fig. 3A measuring b-galactosidase activity ( top ) and protein levels ( Western blot , bottom ) illustrate that b-galactosidase production from the ompR promoter was , indeed , induced by acid pH ( pH 4.4 ) in stationary phase cells . 
However , a Lac -- MudJ insertion within the native copy of ompR prevented acid induction of the putPA : : Km-ompR -- lacZ construct . 
The results indicated that OmpR acts as a positive regulator of its own expression . 
Western blot analysis next revealed that ompR in a strain containing an R2 : : Tn10 insertion was constitutively expressed at a low level and was not acid inducible ( Fig. 3B , bottom ) , a result consistent with autoregulation . 
This resulting low level of OmpR was not sufﬁcient for the induction of acid tolerance ( Fig. 3B , top , second bar set ) but was adequate to enable the acid induction of ompC in log phase cells ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Even though the overall level of ompC -- lacZ expression was low in the ompR : : Tn10 mutant , acid pH still induced ompC fourfold compared with 2.5-fold in the ompR + parent . 
A similar effect was noted in stationary phase , although acid induction of ompC in stationary phase is much less dramatic ( data not shown ) . 
The data indicate that a minimum level of OmpR is necessary for stationary phase acid tolerance . 
The data further suggest that the minimum level of OmpR required for acid tolerance is higher than the minimum level needed to regulate at least some OmpR-dependent genes . 
Acid shock induces ompR transcription from a second promoter
We next questioned whether acid shock increases transcription from the single ompR promoter identiﬁed previously in Salmonella or induces transcription from a second , previously unrecognized promoter . 
Primer extension analysis of RNA extracted from stationary phase pH 8-grown cells and from cells shocked at pH 4.4 for 30 min revealed that acid shock triggers expression from a second promoter ( P2 ) located 20 bp upstream of a constitutively expressed promoter ( P1 ) ( Fig. 4 , lanes 5 versus 6 ) . 
The level of expression from P1 did not change perceptibly , so the increased expression of OmpR transcript in response to acid appears to be determined solely by P2 . 
Consistent with OmpR serving as an activator of ompR transcription during acid shock , the P2 , but not P1 , transcript was eliminated by an insertion into the OmpR open reading frame ( ORF ; Fig. 4 , lanes 9 and 10 ) . 
It should be noted that neither of the Salmonella transcript start sites observed in this study ( using minimal glucose media ) matches the previously reported transcript start identiﬁed from cells grown in LB . 
The published start site is located 2 bases upstream from our P2 transcript ( Liljestrom et al. , 1988 ) .

Phosphorylation of OmpR is required for autoinduction Previously , we demonstrated that an EnvZ mutation reduces acid tolerance 10-fold ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
In contrast , ack pta mutations , which prevent acetyl phosphate production , reduce acid tolerance 500-fold . 
A constitutively active OmpRD55E protein that mimics phosphorylated OmpR suppresses these phosphodonor-dependent acid tolerance defects . 
To determine whether the EnvZ and acetyl phosphate effects on acid tolerance resulted from effects on ompR induction , a series of Western blots was performed using anti-OmpR antibody to measure native OmpR levels as well as anti-b-galactosidase antibody to monitor merodiploid ompR -- lacZ expression . 
The results , shown in Fig. 5A reveal that phosphorylation is required for induction ( Fig. 5A , lanes 1 and 2 versus 7 and 8 ) and that both EnvZ and acetyl phosphate are required for optimum ompR autoinduction ( Fig. 5A , lanes 1 and 2 versus 3 and 4 ) . 
Curiously , the loss of EnvZ had a greater effect on ompR induction than the loss of acetyl phosphate ( Fig. 5A , lanes 1 and 2 versus 3 and 4 ) . 
This is in contrast to what was observed previously when measuring stationary phase acid tolerance ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
The observation that phosphorylation of OmpR was required for autoinduction was then conﬁrmed using the ompR -- lacZ merodiploid fusion strains . 
Figure 5B pre-sents Western blot results documenting the acid shock production of b-galactosidase from the ompR -- lacZ fusion in wild-type and ack pta envZ mutant strains . 
Loss of these two major sources of phosphorylation ( EnvZ and acetyl phosphate ) prevented the acid induction of ompR ( Fig. 5B , lanes 7 and 8 ) . 
Differential contributions of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate to ompR induction were also con-ﬁrmed using the ompR -- lacZ strains ( Fig. 5B , lanes 3 -- 6 ) . 
Once again , the loss of EnvZ had a greater effect on ompR autoinduction than loss of acetyl phosphate . 
OmpR binds to its own promoter
Although the evidence suggests that OmpR can regulate its own expression , OmpR autoregulation could be indirect , with OmpR controlling the expression of a second gene , the product of which directly controls the ompR promoter . 
Consequently , DNA mobility shift assays were performed to determine whether OmpR actually binds to the ompR promoter region . 
A 545 bp region of the ompR promoter was radiolabelled and mixed with different amounts of puriﬁed OmpR or OmpR-P to look at ompR promoter binding . 
The results presented in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrate that phosphorylated OmpR protein binds to the ompR promoter region with a greater afﬁnity than that of unphosphorylated OmpR . 
As expected , the control fragments did not show a mobility shift under any of the conditions tested . 
It is interesting to note that the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with OmpR-P exhibited an apparent stepwise shifting of the ompR promoter fragment with increasing concentrations of OmpR-P , as opposed to a single shift . 
The most obvious explanation for this result becomes apparent from analysis of the ompR promoter DNA sequence used in the EMSA , which contains at least three potential OmpR binding sites ( Fig. 1 ) . 
It is likely that all three sites are bound by OmpR-P when the concentration reaches 8 mM . 
It is also possible that binding of OmpR-P to one binding site facilitates binding to subsequent sites on the promoter region . 
In this way , subsequent binding sites remain unoccupied until the ﬁrst site becomes completely saturated , resulting in the observed stepwise shift of the OmpR-P -- ompR promoter DNA complex .

The results , shown in Fig. 7 , illustrate that OmpR ¬

OmpR-P was added to the DNase I reactions as follows : lane 3 ( none ) , lane 4 ( 10 pmol ) , lane 5 ( 20 pmol ) lane 6 ( 42 pmol ) , lane 7 ( 85 pmol ) , lane 8 ( 170 pmol ) .

Actual protected bases are indicated by open boxes , whereas hypersensitive bases are marked with an asterisk . 
Vertical arrows depict the direction of transcription . 
The bent arrow on the bottom strand indicates the start of transcript P2 . 
P binds to a region encompassing site R2 ( see Fig. 1 ) on both top and bottom strands . 
OmpR-P then binds asymmetrically to site R3 on the top strand and site R1 on the bottom strand . 
Binding to site R3 on the top strands generates a series of DNase I hypersensitive nucleotides on the bottom strand . 
The results conﬁrm that OmpR-P binds to the predicted sites but also indicate that protection extends beyond those sites . 
HN-S is a negative regulator of ompR expression A previous report using E. coli demonstrated that cAMP and CRP affected ompR expression ( Huang et al. , 1992 ) . 
However , the CRP binding site present in E. coli is severely compromised in Salmonella ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Analysis of OmpR production and ompR -- lacZ expression in crp + and crp mutant strains conﬁrmed that cAMP-CRP does not affect OmpR expression ( data not shown ) . 
However , another report indicated that the nucleoid protein H-NS , shown to regulate many genes , was a negative regulator of E. coli ompC ( Tsuzuki et al. , 1994 ) . 
We suspected that H-NS might regulate ompC indirectly , at least in part , by controlling ompR . 
Figure 8 illustrates that H-NS is , indeed , a negative regulator of ompR . 
Mutants defective in hns exhibited high , constitutive levels of OmpR not subject to further induction by acid shock ( Fig. 8A , lanes 3 and 4 ) . 
The table inserted within Fig. 8B shows the effect of an hns mutation on an ompR -- lacZ operon fusion . 
Consistent with the Western blot results , the hns mutant exhibited constitutively high levels of b-galactosidase , indicating that hns affects ompR expression at the transcriptional level . 
Acid shock control of ompR expression
The evidence suggested that H-NS bound to the ompR promoter represses transcription . 
This could be the result of H-NS hindering OmpR-P binding at the R2 binding site or preventing OmpR interaction with RNA polymerase . 
Acid shock could alter the ability of H-NS to bind this region , thereby allowing OmpR-P to bind freely and induce expression from P2 . 
Results presented in Fig. 8B are consistent with this model . 
However , OmpR-P might only be required to counteract the repressive effect of H-NS . 
We then asked whether OmpR was required for ompR expression in an hns mutant . 
To test this hypothesis , expression of ompR -- lac was examined in a hns ompR double mutant . 
The data presented in Fig. 8B show that , in cells lacking H-NS , OmpR , and thus OmpR-P , was not required for high levels of ompR expression . 
Thus , the autoinduction role of OmpR-P is most likely to overcome H-NS repression . 
The next question addressed was whether acid shock might control ompR expression by changing the phosphorylation level of OmpR or , perhaps , by modulating ompR P2 repression by H-NS . 
Table 1 reveals that the constitutively active ompRD55E gene product did not eliminate acid induction of ompR -- lacZ , arguing against a model predicting that pH only controls ompR expression by changing the phosphorylation level of OmpR ( Table 1 , 
Fig. 8 .

JF4541 versus JF4542 and 4544 ) . 
An alternative model states that acid regulates ompR by modulating repression by H-NS . 
Support for this is provided in Fig. 8B , showing that an hns mutant loses most , if not all , pH control of ompR and produces constitutively high levels of OmpR protein even in the absence of OmpR . 
Effect of DNA supercoiling on ompR expression The fact that EnvZ-dependent phosphorylation of OmpR is required to induce ompR suggests that acid stress helps OmpR-P to bind the R2 site and overcome the repressive effect of H-NS . 
One way in which this could be accomplished is through acid stress effects on DNA supercoiling in the ompR promoter region . 
Previous work from this laboratory has shown that acid stress will change DNA topology by decreasing negative supercoiling , and that these topological changes can alter gene expression ( Karem and Foster , 1993 ) . 
H-NS has also been implicated as a modulator of DNA supercoiling in some instances ( Hulton et al. , 1990 ) and was shown here to affect ompR expression . 
Consequently , we tested whether or not altering DNA supercoiling with the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin ( which also decreases negative supercoiling ; Dorman et al. , 1988 ) would affect ompR expression in a manner similar to acid stress . 
Figure 9 reveals that increasing concentrations of novobiocin progressively increased ompR -- lacZ expression in an ompR + merodiploid . 
This effect was dependent on the presence of OmpR , as novobiocin only marginally changed ompR -- lacZ expression in an ompR mutant . 
In contrast to acid , high osmolarity increases negative supercoiling ( Higgins et al. , 1988 ; Karem and Foster , 1993 ) . 
If the model is correct , then high osmolarity should decrease expression of OmpR . 
The Western blot presented in Fig. 2A shows that high osmolarity reduced OmpR levels , a result consistent with this model . 
Discussion
The EnvZ -- OmpR regulatory system is a paradigm of intracellular signal transduction involving two common families of signalling components , sensor histidine kinases and response regulators , that communicate by phosphotransfer mechanisms ( Mizuno and Mizushima , 1990 ; Forst and Roberts , 1994 ) . 
EnvZ , a transmembrane protein , is thought to sense various environmental signals such as osmolarity . 
Upon sensing a signal , EnvZ phosphorylates itself at histidine residue 243 ( Igo and Silhavy , 1988 ; Roberts et al. , 1994 ) and then transfers the phosphate to aspartate 55 of OmpR ( Delgado et al. , 1993 ) . 
How EnvZ senses environmental change is unclear , as the periplasmic region may not be required ( Leonardo and Forst , 1996 ) . 
EnvZ also possesses a phosphatase that will remove phosphate from OmpR-P ( Igo et al. , 1989a , b ; Hsing et al. , 1998 ) . 
The conventional model for OmpR regulation holds that the degree of OmpR phosphorylation governs the expression of ompC and ompF , two genes encoding major outer membrane proteins ( Aiba et al. , 1989 ; Russo and Silhavy , 1993 ) . 
Phosphorylation of OmpR induces a conformational change in the protein ( Kenney et al. , 1995 ) , but how this change inﬂu-ences OmpR control of ompC and ompF is not clearly understood ( Head et al. , 1998 ) . 
Conformational reshaping of OmpR may increase DNA-binding afﬁnity to the ompC and ompF promoters and enable OmpR interaction with the a-subunit of RNA polymerase , thereby activating transcription ( Kenney et al. , 1995 ) . 
Studies have connected OmpR with ﬂagellar expression ( Shin and Park , 1995 ) , cell division ( Pruss , 1998 ) , fatty acid transport ( Higashitani et al. , 1993 ) , microcin synthesis ( Mao and Siegele , 1998 ) , curli ﬁbres ( Romling et al. , 1998 ) and Sal-monella virulence ( Dorman et al. , 1989 ; Bernardini et al. , 1990 ; Chatﬁeld et al. , 1991 ; Lindgren et al. , 1996 ; Lee et al. , 2000 ) . 
Consistent with OmpR being an acid-induced regulator important to Salmonella pathogenicity , Lee et al. ( 2000 ) have recently shown that OmpR regulates the acid induction of the ssrAB two-component signal transduction system located within the Spi2 pathogenicity island . 
The results presented here reveal that H-NS represses ompR , and that OmpR protein directly autoregulates its own expression in response to acid shock by overcoming H-NS repression . 
Direct autoregulation is strongly supported by gel shift and DNA footprint analyses . 
Figure 7 illustrates that OmpR-P asymmetrically protects the ompR promoter from DNase I digestion in vitro . 
Binding is centred around the predicted OmpR binding site ( R2 ) , which was protected in both strands . 
However , site R3 was only protected in the top strand , and site R1 was only protected in the bottom strand . 
All three ompR sites exhibit about 60 % identity to the ompF F1 site . 
However , R2 exhibits the highest homology ( 51 % ) to the published consensus sequence for OmpR binding and contains the central GXXAC motif important to binding ( Harlocker et al. , 1995 ) . 
The ﬁnding that reduced supercoiling imposed by a DNA gyrase inhibitor stimulates OmpR-dependent ompR expression at neutral pH suggests that acid-induced changes in DNA supercoiling around the ompR promoter may inﬂuence OmpR-P binding .

Effect of novobiocin on ompR -- lacZ expression . 
Cells ( JF4484 ) containing an ompR -- lacZ operon fusion were grown to late log phase ( OD600 = 0.8 ) , and novobiocin was added at the concentrations indicated . 
After cultures entered stationary phase ( +12 h ) , cells were assayed for b-galactosidase activity . 
Squares indicate ompR + ; triangles represent ompR -- . 
OmpR-P could recruit RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) , thereby overcoming H-NS repression at P2 , whereas in the second model , OmpR-P does not recruit RNAP but displaces H-NS , thereby allowing RNAP free access to the P2 promoter . 
The fact that OmpR is not needed in the absence of H-NS indicates that OmpR-P is not absolutely required to recruit or activate RNAP , but it may still be needed in that capacity in the presence of H-NS . 
The data also clearly indicate that phosphorylation of OmpR is important for autoinduction , as an envZ ack pta mutant failed to induce ompR . 
However , it seems unlikely that acid induction of ompR results from changes in phosphorylation levels , as ompR remains acid inducible in a mutant containing a constitutively active yet nonphosphorylated OmpRD55E . 
This agrees with the DNA supercoiling model above . 
Nevertheless , the data in Table 1 suggest that the more OmpR-P there is relative to OmpR , the more autoinduction occurs , as the D55E mutant , which would mimic a very high OmpR-P -- OmpR ratio , expressed eightfold more ompR -- lacZ than did wildtype OmpR at either pH. The results do not distinguish between whether the absolute level of OmpR-P or the OmpR-P -- OmpR ratio determines the extent of auto-induction . 
The observation that EnvZ is more important than acetyl phosphate for ompR autoinduction does not necessarily mean that EnvZ is the primary phosphodonor . 
The reason for this is that the phosphatase activity of EnvZ inﬂuences the amount of OmpR-P made from EnvZ or acetyl phosphate and , thus , impacts on the ratio of OmpR-P -- OmpR . 
The loss of the EnvZ phosphatase in an envZ mutant will change that ratio . 
Likewise , the relative roles of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate in ompR autoinduction versus acid tolerance are , at ﬁrst glance , paradoxical . 
EnvZ appears to be most important for ompR autoinduction , but envZ mutants only lower acid tolerance 10-fold . 
In contrast , acetyl phosphate seems to be less important for ompR expression but affects acid tolerance 500-fold . 
This differential effect of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate might also reﬂect differences in either the absolute level of OmpR-P or OmpR-P -- OmpR ratios . 
A further complexity of this system becomes evident with the following question . 
If EnvZ-dependent phosphorylation of OmpR is required for ompR autoinduction , then why do envZ mutations reduce acid tolerance 10-fold versus the 500-fold reduction seen with ompR mutants ? 
The simplest explanation for this is that the uninduced level of OmpR produced in an envZ mutant is enough to provide some acid-induced acid tolerance as long as the protein can be phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate . 
It seems unlikely that acid shock increases AcP-dependent phosphorylation of OmpR , as in vitro studies indicate that mild acid actually decreases this reaction ( L. Kenney , personal communication ) . 
Consequently , acid stress most likely induces the OmpR-P-dependent ATR genes by some alternative means ( altered DNA topology ? ) . 
Thus , the developing model for acid shock induction of stationary phase acid tolerance involves a combination of factors . 
These include ( i ) increasing OmpR levels through autoinduction in which OmpR-P overcomes H-NS repression of ompR ; ( ii ) binding of OmpR-P to speciﬁc ATR genes ; and ( iii ) an undeﬁned effect of acid pH on OmpR-P-dependent ATR gene promoters . 
These effects could involve changing DNA topology or an acid-induced recon-ﬁguration of DNA-bound OmpR-P . 
The signiﬁcance of the acid-induced autoregulation of OmpR is in providing increased acid tolerance and , by controlling members of the Spi2 island , survival of Salmonella in the macrophage phagolysosome . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and cultural conditions
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2 . 
Cells were grown routinely in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) complex media or E minimal medium containing 0.4 % glucose at 37 ∞ C ( Vogel and Bonner , 1956 ) . 
The following antibiotics -- 1 were used as indicated : ampicillin ( 60 mg ml ) ; kanamycin -- 1 -- 1 ( 40 mg ml ) ; tetracycline ( 10 or 20 mg ml for minimal and rich -- 1 medium respectively ) ; chloramphenicol ( 30 mg ml ) . 
Genetic manipulations and b-galactosidase assay
General transduction was performed with P22 HT 105/int , and non-lysogenic segregants were identiﬁed as described previously ( Holley and Foster , 1982 ; Maloy , 1990 ) . 
Standard molecular biological manipulations were performed according to the procedures described by Sambrook et al. ( 1989 ) and Ausubel et al. ( 1999 ) . 
The oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) were purchased from Life Technologies . 
b-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Miller ( 1992 ) and expressed as nmol min -- 1 optical density unit -- 1 ( 600 nm ) . 
For acid-adapted samples , cells grown overnight were collected by centrifugation , washed and resuspended in EG media , pH 4.4 , for 90 min before assay . 
For unadapted samples , overnight cultures were used directly for assay . 
The data presented represent the means and standard deviations from at least three experiments . 
Stationary phase acid tolerance assay
Stationary phase ATR assays were performed with strains grown overnight at 37 ∞ C in E glucose ( EG ) broth containing appropriate antibiotics . 
To prepare acid-adapted cultures , a 500 ml sample of each strain was harvested , cells were washed in EG broth , pH 4.3 , resuspended to 2 ¥ 108 colonyforming units ( cfus ) ml -- 1 in 3 ml of the same pH broth and incubated for 2 h. For acid challenge , unadapted and acid-adapted cells were washed once in EG broth , pH 3.0 , and resuspended to the same optical density ( 0.4 OD600 ) in 3 ml of EG broth , pH 3.0 ( total manipulation time 5 min ) . 
Viable counts were measured by dilution and plating on LB agar at timed intervals . 
Percentage survival was calculated by dividing the cfus at time points after acid challenge by the cfus before acid challenge and multiplying by 100 . 
Values given are representative of triplicate experiments . 
Construction of a merodiploid ompR–lacZ operon
An ompR -- lacZ fusion was constructed and introduced into the put operon of Salmonella using the basic strategy of Elliott ( 1992 ) . 
An 885 bp EcoRI -- BglII fragment of pOR2 ( EK400 ) containing the ompR promoter region and part of the ompR ORF were cloned into an EcoRI -- BamHI-digested pRS551 ( KmR ) operon fusion vector ( Simons et al. , 1987 ) resulting in pBF407 ( EF694 ) . 
The plasmid pBF694 was linearized by XhoI digestion and transformed into an E. coli recD strain , EK298 ( CmR KmS ) , containing a KmS-lacZ cassette inserted into a putPA operon that was itself inserted into the trp locus of E. coli . 
Successful transformants in which recombination occurred between KmR-ompR -- lacZ fusion and the chromosomal KmSCmR-lacZ were identiﬁed as KmR CmS ( Elliott , 1992 ) . 
Chromosomal insertion of the ompR -- lacZ fusion was veriﬁed by PCR with oligo 278 ( 5 cents - AGC TCT TGT TTG AGT GTTT T-3 cents ) for the ompR promoter and oligo 194 ( 5 cents - AGT ATC GGC CTC AGG AAG ATC-3 cents ) for lacZ . 
To transfer the ompR -- lacZ fusion from E. coli ( EF695 ) to S. typhimurium , we used zygotic induction of EF695 with EK297 ( F cents lac [ P22HT105 ] ) . 
A phage lysate generated by co-culture of EK297 and EF695 was used to transduce the restrictionless Salmonella strain SF586 . 
Successful transductants were isolated and veriﬁed by PCR with oligos 278/194 for the ompR -- lacZ fusion and oligos 278/230 ( 5 cents - TCA TGC TTT AGA ACC GTC CG-3 cents ) to conﬁrm the presence of the wild-type + ompR gene . 
RNA preparation and primer extension analysis
Total RNA was extracted by the method described previously ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
Brieﬂy , 500 ml cultures grown overnight were harvested and reconstituted with 500 ml of lysis solution [ 20 mM sodium acetate ( pH 5.5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % SDS ] . 
Then , hot ( 65 ∞ C ) phenol was added to the cell lysates and equilibrated for 5 min at 65 ∞ C. Phenol extraction was performed until no visible residue was apparent at the interface . 
The nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.1 M KCl and three volumes of ethanol at -- 70 ∞ C . 
After centrifugation , DNA was removed by reconstituting the pellets in 200 ml of RNase-free water containing 50 mM MgCl2 and 4 units of DNase I ( RNase-free ; Promega ) . 
After additional phenol -- chloroform extraction , the RNA was precipitated and resuspended in RNase-free water . 
For primer extension analysis of ompR transcription , 20 pmol of oligonucleotide primer 306 ( 5 cents - AAA GATTCACGGGTCAGCAGA ) or 311 ( 5 cents - AGATAACGTTCCA GTAGCGCC ) was 5 cents end labelled with [ g-32P ] - ATP ( 6000 Ci mmol -- 1 ; ICN ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Promega ) ; a 2 pmol primer was incubated with 20 mg of RNA for 90 min at 65 ∞ C . 
The primer and RNA mixture was cooled at room temperature to 42 ∞ C , and extension was performed with 10 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Promega ) ,

2.5 mM dNTP , and 10 U of RNasin ( Promega ) in reverse transcriptase buffer for 90 min at 42 ∞ C . 
After extension , any remaining RNA was eliminated by a further 30 min incubation with 40 mg of DNase-free RNase ( Sigma ) . 
The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol -- chloroform , ethanol precipitated at -- 70 ∞ C and resuspended in the formamide loading buffer . 
Extension products were analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide ( 8 % ) gel electrophoresis . 
DNA sequence ladders were prepared using a T7 Sequenase kit ( USB ) with the same primers as those used for primer extension analysis . 
OmpR phosphorylation
The OmpR phosphorylation reaction was carried out as described by Qin et al. ( 2001 ) . 
Brieﬂy , 100 mg of OmpR was mixed with or without 60 mg of glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) - EnvZc11 ( a ` superkinase ' mutant of EnvZ fused to GST ) in modiﬁed buffer A ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 , 5 mM ATP ) to a ﬁnal volume of 200 ml and incubated at room temperature for 1 h . 
The OmpR and OmpR-P used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) were taken directly from this reaction mixture and added to the EMSA mixture ( described below ) . 
Puriﬁed OmpR protein was a generous gift from L. Kenney ( Oregon Health Services University , USA ) . 
Before use , OmpR protein was desalted using PD-10 columns ( Amersham ) and eluted in modiﬁed buffer A ( no CaCl2 or ATP ) . 
Desalted protein was then concentrated using a Centricon YM-10 centrifugal ﬁlter device ( Amicon Bioseparations ) before use in the EMSA . 
Puriﬁed ( GST ) - EnvZc11 was kindly provided by M. Inouye ( Robert Wood Johnson Medical School , USA ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
For the gel mobility shift assays , a region of DNA encompassing the ompR promoter region and the OmpR open reading frame ( ORF ) was ampliﬁed by PCR ( Taq polymerase ) using Salmonella enterica strain UK1 chromosomal DNA as template with oligos 178 and 335 ( 5 cents - GGTCGACA CCAGGCTGACGAACAG3 cents ; SalI site underlined ) under the following conditions : 25 cycles of 94 ∞ C for 30 s , 55 ∞ C for 30 s and 72 ∞ C for 90 s with a ﬁnal extension at 72 ∞ C for 5 min . 
The resulting 1084 bp DNA fragment was puriﬁed ( BioRad Quick Kleen ) and digested with BglII and HincII to produce a 545 bp product containing the ompR promoter region and two other fragments ( a 344 bp fragment containing the OmpR ORF and a 195 bp fragment ) , which serve as internal controls for spurious binding of OmpR . 
All three DNA fragments were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase ( 0.2 U ; USB ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and end-labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase ( 5 U ; Promega ) and [ g-32P ] - ATP ( 64 mCi ; ICN ) . 
Labelled DNA fragments ( ª 5000 c.p.m. ) , varying amounts of OmpR or OmpR-P ( 20 , 40 , 80 , and 160 pmol , prepared as described above ) and 1 mg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA were mixed in the EMSA binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol , 20 mM MgCl2 , 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8 , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) to a ﬁnal volume of 20 ml and incubated at room temperature for 2 h . 
The entire reaction mixture was then loaded onto a non-denaturing 5 % ( TBE ) polyacrylamide gel ( Criterion , Bio-Rad ) that had been prerun in 0.5 ¥ TBE buffer for 1 h and separated by electrophoresis ( 60 V for 2 h ) . 
DNase I footprinting
The templates used for DNase I footprinting were generated by PCR . 
32P-labelled oligomer 278 and unlabelled oligomer 311 were used to label the coding strand . 
Unlabelled oligomer 278 and 32P-labelled oligomer 311 were used to label the non-coding ( template ) strand . 
Binding reactions for DNase I were identical to the binding reaction conditions used for the gel mobility shift experiments except that glycerol was omitted . 
DNase I cleavage was done by adding 20 ml of a solution containing 5 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I ( Promega ) . 
After 5 min , the DNase I reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 ml of 4 M ammonium acetate and 30 mM EDTA . 
The DNA was extracted with phenol -- chloroform , precipitated with 95 % ethanol and washed with 70 % ethanol . 
The pellet was dissolved in formamide loading buffer , heated at 95 ∞ C for 5 min and subsequently analysed by electrophoresis through a denaturing 8 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Western blot analysis
OmpR and b-galactosidase protein levels were estimated by Western blot analysis . 
For OmpR , the method used was essentially as described previously ( Bang et al. , 2000 ) . 
For b-galactosidase , 2 mg of total protein was electrophoresed through a 7.5 % SDS -- polyacrylamide gel . 
After transfer to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore ) , nonspeciﬁc protein interactions were blocked with 5 % powdered milk in TBST buffer [ 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.05 % ( v/v ) Tween 20 ] for 2 h at room temperature . 
The membrane was probed with a 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal antisera against b-galactosidase ( Sigma ) in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature . 
The blots were washed several times in TBST buffer , then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of secondary anti-mouse immunoglobulin G -- peroxidase conjugate ( Sigma ) in TBST buffer containing 5 % powdered milk for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer 's speciﬁed protocol ( ECL Western blotting detection reagent , Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech ) . 
After autoradiography , densitometry was used to analyse relative levels of OmpR protein and message using Scion IMAGE software . 
The data presented are representative of three independent experiments .
