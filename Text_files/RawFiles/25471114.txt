Abstract 
Pathogenic invasion by Escherichia coli and Salmonellae remains a constant threat to the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and can rapidly induce inﬂammatory responses . 
At birth , colostrum consumption exerts numerous beneﬁcial effects on the properties of intestinal epithelial cells and protects the gastrointestinal tract of newborns from pathogenic invasion . 
The present study aimed to investigate the effect of colostrum on the early and late inﬂammatory responses induced by pathogens . 
The short-term ( 2 h ) and long-term ( 24 h ) effects of exposure to heat-killed ( HK ) E. coli and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium on gene expression in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell ( IPEC-J2 ) model were ﬁrst evaluated by microarray and quantitative PCR analyses . 
Luciferase assays were performed using a NF-kB-luc reporter construct to investigate the effect of colostrum whey treatment on the activation of NF-kB induced by HK bacteria . 
Luciferase assays were also performed using NF-kB-luc , IL-8-luc and IL-6-luc reporter constructs in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 / 15 cells 
exposed to dose -- response stimulations with HK bacteria and colostrum whey . 
Bovine colostrum whey treatment decreased the expression of early and late inﬂammatory genes induced by HK bacteria in IPEC-J2 , as well as the transcriptional activation of NF-kB-luc induced by HK bacteria . 
Unlike that with colostrum whey , treatment with other milk fractions failed to decrease the activation of NF-kB-luc induced by HK bacteria . 
Lastly , the reduction of the HK bacteria-induced activation of NF-kB-luc , IL-8-luc and IL-6-luc by colostrum whey was dose dependent . 
The results of the present study indicate that bovine colostrum may protect and preserve the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier in the host by controlling the expression levels of early and late inﬂammatory genes following invasion by enteric pathogens .

Moreover , contamination by infected animals during slaughter can have potentially devastating consequences for the food industry and ultimately for consumers . 
To prevent infections as well as to promote animal growth , subclinical doses of antibiotics can be added to animal feed , such as for swine and poultry . 
Although this practice is still accepted in North America , it has been severely criticised and banished in Europe , because of the threat it generates regarding possible emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the environment and potential negative effects on public health . 
Therefore , many efforts are being made to ﬁnd novel approaches , such as the use of harmless natural products as feed additives , to prevent enteric infections caused by ETEC , Salmonella and other pathogens . 
Although numerous additives and ingredients , 
Key words: Transcription regulation: Escherichia coli: Salmonellae: Intestinal epithelial cells: Inﬂammatory responses
Infections caused by Escherichia coli and Salmonellae can signiﬁcantly affect animal and human health as well as food safety . 
Although these bacteria are fundamentally very different , there are some similarities between their pathogenesis . 
For instance , infections caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli ( ETEC ) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 
usually occur in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to cramps , diarrhoea and vomiting . 
( 1 -- 4 ) In addition , both pathogens have the capacity to stimulate innate immune responses and inﬂammatory cytokine production . 
Indeed , the expression of IL8 is rapidly ( 5 -- 10 ) induced in porcine intestinal epithelial cells ( IPEC-J2 ) after 
exposure to ETEC or Salmonella challenges as well as by the toxins produced by these bacteria . 
( 11 -- 13 ) In domestic animals , infections caused by E. coli and Salmonella lead to reduced feed intake and growth performance and can

namely probiotics and prebiotics , have the potential to replace in-feed antibiotics , their effectiveness is often controversial and remains to be demonstrated . 
Among other comp - ( 14 ) lementary alternatives , bovine milk and colostrum , as well as other milk products such as cheese whey and milk peptides , have been identiﬁed for their potential to modulate intestinal defence functions and microbiota establishment . 
( 15 -- 19 ) Colostrum , the ﬁrst milk produced after birth , is rich in Ig and growth factors as well as immunoregulatory and antimicrobial factors . 
This combination of bioactive ingredients ( 20 ) generates optimal conditions in the gastrointestinal tract of newborns to promote health and resistance to external threats . 
Indeed , the high content of Ig and various factors involved in the development and regulation of the immune system contributes to the provision of passive immunity to the offspring after birth and protection against bacterial and viral infections . 
( 21,22 ) Interestingly , most of the bioactive components of colos-trum are found in the soluble whey portion after the removal of casein . 
Indeed , concentrated Ig , lactoferrin , growth factors , and lactoperoxidase as well as most of the immune cell factors are recovered in the whey fraction following isoelectric precipitation . 
Therefore , the use of bovine colostrum ( 23,24 ) whey as a feed additive to prevent enteric infections and to promote growth appears to be an interesting approach to improve intestinal health . 
In fact , studies have shown that bovine colostrum concentrates attenuate the symptoms of acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea in children infected with enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and that enterohaemorrhagic E. coli haemolysin can be neutralised by Ig isolated from bovine colostrum . 
Bovine colostrum exerts protective ( 25,26 ) effects in mice infected with E. coli through the inhibition of bacterial attachment to the intestinal mucous membrane and through the prevention of both bacterial colonisation and growth in the intestinal tract . 
Piglets fed a weanling diet ( 27 ) supplemented with bovine colostrum exhibit an improvement in growth performance and a decrease in diarrhoea episodes when compared with control piglets , while a formula ( 28 ) containing bovine colostrum whey is better than others at improving intestinal defence function and protecting against necrotising enterocolitis . 
Moreover , different products of ( 29 ) bovine whey protein concentrates decrease the attachment of Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli to Caco-2 cells ( 30 ) and bovine colostrum oligosaccharides reduce Campylobacter jejuni infections . 
( 31 ) Although the beneﬁcial effects of colostrum on intestinal health have been observed in various studies , the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown . 
Considering the strong similarities and signiﬁcant repercussions of ETEC and Salmonella infections for human and pig health , the components of these pathogens were used in the present study to stimulate the inﬂammatory responses of IPEC-J2 and human intestinal epithelial cells and to demonstrate the effect of bovine colostrum whey on the activation of the NF-kB transcription factor and the regulation of gene expression . 
Materials and methods
Cell culture
Non-transformed IPEC-J2 , derived from the jejunum of new - ( 32 ) born piglets , were cultured in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's medium -- Ham 's F-12 ( 1:1 ) ( Wisent ) supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Wisent ) , insulin -- transferrin -- selenium ( ITS premix ; BD Biosciences ) , glutamine and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor ( Wisent ) . 
For the induction of cell differentiation , conﬂuent IPEC-J2 were grown in a fetal bovine serum-deprived medium 27 supplemented with 10 M-dexamethasone ( Sigma-Aldrich Canada ) for 10 d. Caco-2 / 15 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's ( 33 ) medium high glucose ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 25 mM-HEPES and glutaMAX ( Invitrogen ) . 
Preparation of colostrum whey and milk fractions
Bovine colostrum whey was prepared as described previously , by isoelectric precipitation ( pH 4 · 6 ) of defatted ( 34 ) colostrum , followed by centrifugal separation to remove the casein precipitate . 
Supernatants were freeze-dried . 
Cheese whey , obtained from a local cheese factory ( L'Ance ̂tre ) , was skimmed , ﬁltered ( Tetra Pak MSF1 ) through a 1 · 4 mm membrane 
( Membraloxe ; Pall Corporation ) , concentrated by ultraﬁltration through a 5 kDa membrane ( Romicon ; Koch Membrane Systems ) , freeze-dried and stored at 2208C . 
The ﬁnal protein concentrations of colostrum whey and cheese whey were 68 · 1 and 71 · 8 % , respectively . 
Both whey products were irradiated with a dose of 5 kGy using a Gammacell 220 irradiator unit ( Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ) and refrozen at 2208C . 
Bovine lactoferrin was obtained from DMV International . 
Bovine caseinomacropeptide was a kind gift from Dr G. Robitaille ( Centre de recherche et de développement sur les aliments , Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada ; St-Hyacinthe , QC , Canada ) and was extracted as described previously . 
For the in cellulo ( 35 ) experiments , colostrum whey , milk whey , lactoferrin and caseinomacropeptide were diluted in Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) . 
Heat-killed bacteria
The ETEC F4 strain ECL8559 ( 0149 : LT : STa : STb : East1 : paa : hemb : F4 ) and the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 # ( 11 ) 4393 were , respectively , obtained from Dr J. M. Fairbrother ( 36 ) and Dr A. Letellier . 
Bacteria were grown in Lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium to exponential phase and quantiﬁed on LB agar plates . 
Bacteria were precipitated by centrifugation , resuspended in Opti-MEM and killed by incubation for 1 h at 12 708C . 
Stocks of E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium ( 10 colony-forming units ( CFU ) / ml ) were kept frozen until use . 
Final diluted concentrations of 10 CFU/ml , for the stimu-11 lation of IPEC-J2 , and 10 -- 10 CFU/ml , for the stimulation 9 11 of Caco-2 / 15 cells , were used . 
Microarray analysis
Differentiated IPEC-J2 were stimulated with HK bacteria ( 10 CFU/ml ) for 2 and 24 h , with or without colostrum 11 whey ( 10 mg/ml ) . 
Total RNA were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen ) . 
All samples were submitted to RNA quality control with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) , using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit . 
Comp-lementary DNA was synthesised using 25 ng of RNA , and hybridisation with the Agilent Porcine Gene Expression Micro-arrays was performed at the Microarray platform of the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre . 
Three independent experiments were performed for each condition . 
Data analysis , normalisation , and average difference and expression analyses for each feature on the chip were performed using FlexArray software version 1.6.1 ( Génome 
Québec ) . 
Fold changes were determined by comparing gene expression in treated cells with that in control untreated cells and are reported in log2 scale . 
Genes with expression levels that were increased more than 2-fold ( log2 .1 ) after stimulation with HK bacteria were selected and analysed according to their Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and Gene Ontology classiﬁcation , with 
Gene Ontology searches using ` Database for Annotation , Visualization , and Integrated Discovery , version 2008 ' ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ ) and ToppGene Suite ( http : / / toppgene.cchmc.org / ) . 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Differentiated IPEC-J2 were treated with HK bacteria for 2 and 24 h , with or without colostrum whey . 
RNA were prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen ) . 
Complementary DNA were synthesised using oligo ( dT ) and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Quantitative PCR ( q-PCR ) analysis was performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems and Life Technologies , Inc. ) . 
Primers used in the q-PCR analysis , designed with Primer-Blast ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast ) , are listed in Table 1 . 
Data were analysed by the DDCT method , using b-actin as the internal control . 
All data passed the normality and homogeneity of variance tests , and there were no signiﬁcant differences in the quantity of b-actin RNA among all the RNA samples extracted . 
The identity and purity of the ampliﬁed product were checked through the melting curve analysis carried out at the end of ampliﬁcation . 
Luciferase assays
IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 / 15 cells were grown in twenty-four-well plates and were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter construct NF-kB-luc , IL-8-luc or IL-6-luc using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The reporter construct NF-kB-luc has multiple copies of a NF-kB response element that drives the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene , while the reporter constructs IL-8-luc and IL-6-luc have the promoter regions of

Results
Colostrum whey affects the expression of early and late genes induced by heat-killed bacteria
Among the genes induced by HK bacteria , sixty-two were known and characterised , while another seventy-one probes had no gene name associated with them , as revealed by the microarray analysis . 
To determine the cellular mechanisms triggered by bacterial components in IPEC-J2 , known and characterised genes were categorised according to their temporal expression patterns , based on their expression levels after 2 and 24 h of stimulation with HK bacteria . 
The expression of early genes was induced after 2 h , but their expression levels returned to control levels after 24 h ( twenty-nine genes in total ) . 
On the other hand , the expression of ﬁfteen late genes was not induced after 2 h , but their expression levels were elevated after 24 h. Lastly , the expression of eighteen genes was induced at both time points . 
These three groups of genes were classiﬁed according to the Gene Ontology biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and the gene counts were compared ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Interestingly , classes including ` cell activation ' , ` tissue remodelling ' , ` JAK -- STAT cascade ' ( Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway ) , ` regulation of cell death ' and ` cell proliferation ' mainly comprised early genes . 
On the other hand , classes including ` type I interferon-mediated signalling pathway ' and ` response to virus ' comprised a signiﬁcant number of late genes . 
The expression of genes involved in other classes of biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways related to immunity , inﬂammation , defence response , wounding and migration was induced early , late or at both time points by HK bacteria . 
The classiﬁcation details of early genes ( 2 h ) , late genes ( 24 h ) and genes induced at both time points are given in online supplementary Tables S1 -- S3 , respectively . 
The effect of colostrum whey treatment on the expression of genes after stimulation with HK bacteria was investigated . 
The HK bacteria induction of immune , defence and inﬂammatory response genes was mostly decreased by colostrum whey treatment . 
On the other hand , the induction by HK bacteria of genes involved in proliferation , wounding and migration processes was rather increased in colostrum whey-treated cells ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The effect of colostrum whey treatment on the expression of immune and inﬂammatory response genes after stimulation with HK bacteria is further summarised in Table 2 , while the effect on that of other genes is summarised in Table 3 . 
The colostrum whey-dependent reduction of immune and inﬂammatory gene expression after stimulation with HK bacteria was further conﬁrmed by the q-PCR analysis . 
Colostrum whey treatment decreased the expression of IL8 , chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 5 ( CCL5 ) , serum amyloid A2 ( SAA2 ) , IL6 , CD40 molecule , TNF receptor superfamily member 5 ( CD40 ) , IL19 , chitinase 3-like 1 ( CHI3L1 ) and IL23A after 2 h of stimulation with HK bacteria ( Fig. 3 ( a ) ) . 
The q-PCR analysis results also revealed that colostrum whey treatment decreased the expression of CCL2 and increased the expression of chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) ligand 2 ( CXCL2 ) after 2 h of stimulation with HK bacteria , in contrast to the microarray analysis results showing no signiﬁcant differences in the expression of either gene after colostrum whey treatment . 
The q-PCR analysis results also failed to show a signiﬁcant decrease in the expression of CCL20 and interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF1 ) after colostrum whey treatment , as revealed by the

The expression levels measured after 2 h of stimulation with HK bacteria were decreased after 24 h for most of the genes , except SAA2 , CHI3L1 , CCL4 , orosomucoid 1 ( ORM1 ) and CXCL10 , the expression levels of which were either increased or remained unchanged ( Fig. 3 ( b ) ) . 
Colostrum whey treatment decreased the expression of CCL5 , SAA2 , CHI3L1 , ORM1 and CXCL10 , but did not affect the expression of IL8 and IRF1 , conﬁrming similar observations made during the microarray analysis . 
Together , these results reveal that colostrum whey has marked immunoregulatory and anti-inﬂammatory properties , as evidenced by a decrease in the expression of most of the inﬂammatory genes induced by HK bacteria . 
Similar observations were also made in human colon carcinoma Caco-2 / 15 cells , in which a decrease in the expression and secretion of IL8 , CCL2 and CXCL10 after colostrum whey treatment was measured using , respectively , the q-PCR analysis and ELISA ( data not shown ) .

Colostrum whey decreases the activation of NF-kB induced by heat-killed bacteria
NF-kB is a transcription factor that plays a major role in the cellular response to a wide variety of stimuli , including pathogens such as ETEC and Salmonella . 
The effect of ( 37 ) colostrum whey treatment on the activation of NF-kB induced by HK bacteria was investigated . 
The results obtained in both IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 / 15 cells revealed that colostrum whey treatment decreased the HK bacteria-dependent induction of NF-kB-luc activity after 6 h ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Interestingly , treatment with other milk fractions , including cheese whey as well as two milk components , namely lactoferrin and caseinomacro-peptide , failed to decrease NF-kB-luc activity induced by HK bacteria in IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 / 15 cells . 
A dose-dependent decrease in NF-kB-luc activity induced by HK bacteria was observed in the colostrum whey-treated Caco-2 / 15 cells was also observed using the inﬂammatory reporter constructs IL-8-luc and IL-6-luc ( Fig. 5 ( b ) and ( c ) ) .

This dose-dependent decrease in the HK bacteria-dependent induction caused by colostrum whey treatment 
Discussion
The beneﬁcial effects of colostrum on intestinal epithelial function and development are well known and the protection it gives to newborns against enteric infections has been observed in a number of studies . 
In addition , the ( 22,38 -- 40 ) importance of colostrum for the development of the immune system is well established . 
However , the mol - ( 41,42 ) ecular mechanisms involved in the colostrum regulation of intestinal inﬂammation caused by pathogenic invasion remain poorly understood . 
The results of the present study showed that bovine colostrum whey treatment speciﬁcally decreased the expression of inﬂammatory genes and the activation of the NF-kB signalling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to pathogenic bacteria . 
Although the release of pro-inﬂammatory chemokines and cytokines by intestinal epithelial cells during infections is crucial because it triggers the recruitment of neutrophils , macro-phages and dendritic cells to the site of infection , which in turn initiate innate and adaptive immune responses , it leads to an increase in neutrophil extravasation and vascular permeability , eventually leading to tissue damage and ﬂuid loss in the ( 2 -- 4 ) intestinal lumen . 
In fact , the induction of inﬂammatory gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells after stimulation with ETEC or Salmonella , as well as a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance associated with increased paracellular ( 5,6,12,13,43 -- 49 ) permeability , has been described in many studies . 
Indeed , the results of the microarray analysis carried out in the present study showed that the expression of many genes involved in the regulation of cell death , including CCL5 , CD40 , IL19 , IL6 , IRF1 , signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A ( STAT5A ) , nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor , a ( NFKBIA ) , and S100 calcium-binding proteins A8 and A9 ( S100A8 and S100A9 ) , in IPEC-J2 was rapidly induced after stimulation with HK bacteria and colostrum whey treatment decreased the induction of their expression . 
Together , these results suggest that colostrum whey might act by limiting the inﬂammatory processes in cells and preventing destructive processes induced by pathogens . 
Indeed , studies carried out in premature infants have shown that lactoferrin , as well as other speciﬁc nutrients , preserve the integrity of mucosal barrier by modulating host defence mechanisms and bacterial translocation . 
( 50 ) Previous studies have shown that milk components inhibit bacterial activity by preventing bacterial growth and cell binding . 
Therefore , colostrum whey may indirectly ( 30,51 -- 54 ) inhibit the inﬂammatory responses of intestinal epithelial cells by blocking the interaction between bacterial components and epithelial cell membrane receptors . 
In fact , the antiinﬂammatory effect exerted by colostrum whey required the simultaneous presence of bacterial components , as preincubation of cells with colostrum whey failed to block the activation of NF-kB induced by further stimulation with bacteria , unless colostrum whey remained in the medium during bacterial stimulation ( data not shown ) . 
In addition , the activation of NF-kB-luc was not decreased when colos-trum whey was added 4 h after stimulation with HK bacteria .

Recent results obtained in our laboratory have shown that colostrum whey also exerts beneﬁcial effects directly on intestinal epithelial cells by promoting proliferation and wound-healing processes . 
Indeed , the exposure of intesti - ( 55 ) nal epithelial cells to colostrum whey alone rapidly induces the expression of a number of genes , including colony-stimulating factor 2 ( CSF2 ) , cytochrome P450 1A1 ( CYP1A1 ) , cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer , 61 ( CYR61 ) , growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible , a ( GADD45A ) , hyaluronan synthase 3 ( HAS3 ) , IL8 , plasminogen activator , urokinase ( PLAU ) and TCDD-inducible poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( TIPARP ) , which are also implicated in the cellular response to bacterial components as observed in the present study . 
Other studies have shown that bovine colostrum exerts protective effects against necrotising enterocolitis and formula-induced inﬂammation in preterm pigs and promotes ( 29,39 ) tissue recovery following intestinal damage in mice . 
( 40 ) In addition , a study performed in weaned pigs has shown that intestinal weight and villus height are affected by bovine colostrum . 
Thus , the protective role of colostrum whey in ( 56 ) the intestinal epithelium is likely to go beyond preventing the attachment of pathogens to the epithelium , but also promotes directly health and integrity of intestinal epithelium by regulating cellular processes . 
Interestingly , cheese whey and other components obtained from bovine milk , including lactoferrin and caseinomacropeptide , failed to decrease the induction of NF-kB-luc activity . 
This was also observed in our recent study , in which colos-trum was found to promote the migration of intestinal epi-thelial cells , while cheese whey at a similar concentration failed to do so . 
Therefore , a unique component of colos - ( 55 ) trum whey or the precise composition and proportion of colostrum whey components seem to be critical for the responses of intestinal epithelial cells to pathogens . 
Indeed , immune and antibacterial components found speciﬁcally in colostrum whey might be required to attenuate immune and inﬂammatory activation through the NF-kB signalling pathway . 
In addition , the proportion of these beneﬁcial molecules is important as a dose-dependent decrease in HK bacteria-induced NF-kB-luc activity was observed in the colostrum whey-treated Caco-2 / 15 cells .

Conclusion
Colostrum contains a wide variety of immunoregulatory molecules that could counteract numerous intestinal diseases , including bacterial or viral gastroenteritis and inﬂammatory bowel disease . 
The results of the present study indicate that colostrum treatment decreases inﬂammatory responses and inﬂammatory gene expression induced by ETEC and Salmonella components in the intestinal epithelial cells . 
This colostrum whey-dependent reduction of inﬂammatory gene expression is associated with a reduction of NF-kB activation . 
The results also indicate that colostrum can control inﬂammatory processes in intestinal epithelial cells in the presence of pathogens by decreasing the ability of bacteria to bind to epi-thelial cells and/or by acting directly on intestinal epithelial cells , promoting the growth and integrity of the epithelium while moderating inﬂammatory signalling pathways . 
Therefore , colostrum whey holds great potential as a feed additive for preventing gastrointestinal infections .
