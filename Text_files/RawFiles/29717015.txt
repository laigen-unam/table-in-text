ABSTRACT Flagellum-driven motility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium facilitates host colonization . 
However , the large extracellular ﬂagellum is also a prime target for the immune system . 
As consequence , expression of ﬂagella is bistable within a population of Salmonella , resulting in ﬂagellated and nonﬂagellated subpopulations . 
This allows the bacteria to maximize ﬁtness in hostile environments . 
The degenerate EAL domain protein RﬂP ( formerly YdiV ) is responsible for the bi-stable expression of ﬂagella by directing the ﬂagellar master regulatory complex FlhD4C2 with respect to proteolytic degradation . 
Information concerning the environmental cues controlling expression of rﬂP and thus about the bistable ﬂagellar biosynthesis remains ambiguous . 
Here , we demonstrated that RﬂP responds to cell envelope stress and alterations of outer membrane integrity . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) truncation mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium exhibited increasing motility defects due to downregulation of ﬂagellar gene expression . 
Transposon mutagenesis and genetic proﬁling revealed that 24 ( RpoE ) and Rcs phosphorelay-dependent cell envelope stress response systems sense modiﬁcations of the lipopolysaccaride , low pH , and activity of the complement system . 
This subsequently results in activation of RﬂP expression and degradation of FlhD4C2 via ClpXP . 
We speculate that the presence of diverse hostile environments inside the host might result in cell envelope damage and would thus trigger the repression of resource-costly and immunogenic ﬂagellum biosynthesis via activation of the cell envelope stress response .

IMPORTANCE Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella Typhimurium sense and adapt to a multitude of changing and stressful environments during host infection . 
At the initial stage of gastrointestinal colonization , Salmonella uses ﬂagellum-mediated motility to reach preferred sites of infection . 
However , the ﬂagellum also constitutes a prime target for the host 's immune response . 
Accordingly , the pathogen needs to determine the spatiotemporal stage of infection and control ﬂagellar biosynthesis in a robust manner . 
We found that Salmonella uses signals from cell envelope stress-sensing systems to turn off production of ﬂagella . 
We speculate that downregulation of ﬂagellum synthesis after cell envelope damage in hostile environments aids survival of Salmonella during late stages of infection and provides a means to escape recognition by the immune system . 
The enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is able to move in a directed manner using ﬂagellum-mediated propulsion in a process known as chemotaxis ( 1 ) . 
The bacterial ﬂagellum is a complex macromolecular machine and made via self-assembly of dozens of different proteins ( 2 , 3 ) . 
A mature external ﬁlament consists of ~ 20,000 ﬂagellin subunits ; thus , de novo production of ﬂagella constitutes a high metabolic burden ( 4 ) . 
Accordingly , ﬂagellar biosynthesis is tightly controlled at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels . 
At the transcriptional level , ﬂagellar gene expression is hierarchically organized . 
The ﬂhDC master regulatory operon is under the control of a class 1 promoter and is activated in response to a plethora of environmental signals ( 5 ) . 
The master regulatory complex FlhD4C2 activates gene expression from class 2 promoters . 
Its gene products build the basal body and the hook of the ﬂagellum . 
Once the hook-basal-body ( HBB ) complex is completed , expression of genes under the control of class 3 promoters , including genes coding for the ﬁlament , motor-force generators , and chemosensory system , is derepressed ( 3 , 6 ) . 
Transcriptional regulation of the ﬂagellar master regulator is a complex process and is controlled by numerous global transcriptional regulators ( e.g. , RcsB , RﬂM , HilD , and LrhA ) , which act on the level of the class 1 promoter of ﬂhDC ( 7 -- 10 ) . 
Posttranslational regulation of FlhD4C2 is dependent on the activity of degenerate EAL domain-containing protein RﬂP ( regulator of FlhDC proteolysis ; formerly known as YdiV [ 11 ] ) . 
It targets FlhD4C2 protein complexes with respect to proteolytic degradation by the ClpXP protease ( 12 ) . 
In S. Typhimurium , the concentration of nutrients tunes the fractions of motile and nonmo-tile bacteria . 
RﬂP was shown to be responsible for the observed nutrient-dependent phenotypic heterogeneity of ﬂagellar gene expression ( 13 -- 15 ) . 
The ability to move is an important virulence trait of Salmonella . 
However , the ﬂagellar ﬁlament is also highly immunogenic . 
Thus , ﬂagellum synthesis is suppressed at the primary site of infection to avoid immune recognition by either Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR-5 ) or the NRLC4/NAIP5/6 inﬂammasome ( 16 , 17 ) . 
Further , S. Typhimurium appears to exploit the above-mentioned heterogeneous regulation of ﬂagellum production during the early stages of infection in addition to population-wide repression of ﬂagellar gene expression during systemic infection . 
The bistable regulation of ﬂagellum synthesis may prime subpopulations of Salmonella to both evade the immune system in deeper organs and survive in the small intestine , where motility might be advantageous ( 18 , 19 ) . 
However , knowledge concerning the signals controlling the expression of the bistable switch protein RﬂP remained elusive . 
S. Typhimurium employs sophisticated sensory signal transduction systems to sense and adapt to its environment . 
Throughout host infection , Salmonella encounters various stress conditions , including temperature and oxidative/nitrosative or cell envelope stress , within a short period of time . 
These diverse environments require important lifestyle decisions by the bacteria . 
In order to sense external stresses , Salmonella relies on several sensory systems . 
This allows the bacteria to respond to various environments and to ﬁne-tune its gene expression proﬁle . 
In particular , the Psp , Bae , Cpx , and Rcs systems as well as the Rse - 24 system are known to sense and drive gene expression in response to cell envelope stress ( 20 , 21 ) . 
Signals that trigger the 24 response include misfolded proteins located in the periplasm . 
However , the 24 regulon also comprises proteins connected to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) synthesis ( 21 ) . 
In addition , a drastic reduction of the LPS moieties results in perturbations of the outer membrane ( OM ) ( 22 ) . 
Recently , we characterized novel factors affecting motility of S. Typhimurium ( 23 ) . 
We observed strongly reduced motility of a deep rough LPS mutant ( ΔrfaG ) deﬁcient in outer core and O-antigen synthesis . 
Similar ﬁndings were also reported for mutant ΔrfaD , another deep rough LPS mutant of Salmonella , which is also unable to synthesize the inner core ( 22 , 24 ) , as well as for several Escherichia coli LPS mutants ( 25 ) . 
In E. coli , LPS truncation mutants were shown to display reduced ﬂagellin levels due to a defect in ﬂhDC transcription ( 25 , 26 ) . 
The motility phenotype was rescued by deletion of rcsB , rcsD , or rcsF . 
Activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system has been shown to repress ﬂhDC expression ( 27 , 28 ) , suggesting that repression of motility occurs via the Rcs signaling pathway in E. coli mutants defective in LPS synthesis . 
In the present study , we aimed to characterize the regulatory link between LPS truncations and abrogated motility in S. Typhimurium . 
To address this issue , we characterized Salmonella LPS mutants rfaL , rfaG , and ΔrfaD and observed that decreases in ﬂagellum expression were dependent on the length of the LPS structure ; i.e. , increasing truncations of the LPS resulted in stronger repression of ﬂagellar synthesis . 
A Tn5-based transposon mutagenesis approach and transcriptional proﬁling revealed that activation of cell envelope stress sensing systems , including stress sigma factor 24 and the Rcs system , results in repression of ﬂagellar motility via the action of RﬂP . 
Expression of rﬂP was induced in response to various forms of cell envelope stress , including truncations of the LPS structure , EDTA , acidic pH , or serum ( i.e. , the complement system ) . 
We thus propose that Salmonella senses alterations in cell envelope integrity in response to host defense mechanisms and subsequently downregulates ﬂagellar synthesis to maximize its ﬁtness in hostile environments inside the host .

RESULTS Sequential truncation of the LPS results in stepwise downregulation of ﬂagel-
lum synthesis . 
Motility is impaired in deep rough LPS truncation mutants ΔrfaG and ΔrfaD ( 23 , 24 ) . 
We thus analyzed the motility phenotype of another rough LPS Salmo-nella mutant deﬁcient for rfaL . 
The rfaL mutant lacks the O-antigen , while the rfaG mutant lacks the outer core and the O-antigen . 
The rfaD mutant retains only the KDO segment of the outer LPS structure ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Increasing truncations of the LPS structure resulted in decreasing motility ( Fig. 1B ) , which conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings in E. coli ( 25 ) . 
Scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type ( Wt ) Salmonella bacteria were fully ﬂagellated . 
Similarly , the rfaL-deﬁcient strain was ﬂagellated . 
Its reduced motility may arise from strong aggregation of bacterial cell bodies ( Fig. 1C ) . 
In contrast , the ΔrfaG mutant expressed signiﬁcantly lower levels of ﬂagella , which explains the strongly reduced motility . 
Finally , complete removal of the LPS core structure ( ΔrfaD ) entirely abrogated ﬂagellation and motility ( Fig. 1B and C ; see also Fig . 
S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
This was further conﬁrmed by the absence of ﬂagellin ( FliC ) production and secretion ( Fig. 1D ) . 
We next investigated whether the loss of ﬂagella was caused by alterations of the membrane due to the LPS truncations or was due to regulatory effects on ﬂagellar gene expression as previously suggested for E. coli ( 25 ) . 
Therefore , we tested gene expression from the three ﬂagellar promoter classes in the Wt , ΔrfaG , and ΔrfaD strains using transcriptional lacZ reporter fusions ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Flagellar gene expression from class 2 ( ﬂiL ) and class 3 ( motA and ﬂjB ) promoters was strongly reduced in the LPS truncation mutants . 
Gene expression from the class 1 promoter ( ﬂhC ) , however , was affected only slightly ( Fig. 2B ) . 
The pronounced downregulation of ﬂagellar transcripts expressed from class 2 and class 3 promoters was conﬁrmed by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR ( RT-qPCR ) ( Fig . 
S2 ) . 
These ﬁndings suggested the occurrence of primarily posttranscriptional regulation at the level of the FlhD4C2 master regulatory complex . 
The FlhD4C2 protein complex is known to be subject to proteolytic degradation ( 12 ) . 
Accordingly , we tested the stability of epitope-tagged FlhC protein after arrest of de novo protein synthesis and found that the FlhC protein was degraded substantially faster in the ΔrfaG LPS truncation mutant than in the Wt strain ( Fig. 2C ) . 
These results show that the reduced motility of the LPS truncation mutants was due to posttranscriptional regulation at the level of the ﬂagellar master regulatory complex , FlhD4C2 . 
Induction of cell envelope stress using EDTA mimics an LPS truncation phenotype . 
Modiﬁcations of the LPS moiety result in perturbations of the outer membrane ( OM ) ( 22 ) . 
We thus hypothesized that the observed reduction of ﬂagellar gene expression in the LPS truncation mutants was indirect , since perturbations of the outer membrane might result in general cell envelope stress . 
To test this hypothesis , we measured destabilization of the OM in LPS mutants using the established 1-N-phenylnaphtylamine ( NPN ) uptake assay ( 29 , 30 ) . 
NPN is an environment-sensitive dye that emits ﬂuorescence when integrated into membranes but not in solution . 
When the OM is compromised , the dye is able to enter and integrate into the inner membrane . 
In line with our hypothesis , the levels of ﬂuorescence intensity of the ΔrfaG and ΔrfaD LPS mutants were increased by 1.6-fold and 4.3-fold compared to the Wt , respectively ( Fig. 3A ) . 
We next used EDTA to mimic cell envelope stress independently of truncations of the LPS as described before ( 31 ) . 
Wt Salmonella incubated with 1 mM EDTA exhibited a phenotype in terms of ﬂagellation and motility similar to that seen with an rfaG-deﬁcient strain ( Fig. 3B to D ) . 
This observation was consistent with our hypothesis that ﬂagellum synthesis is downregulated by an apparent cell envelope stress induced by either LPS truncations or perturbations of the outer membrane after addition of EDTA . 
RﬂP is a key regulator that controls ﬂagellum expression during envelope stress . 
To elucidate the regulatory circuit underlying the observed motility and ﬂagellum biosynthesis defect ( Fig. 4A ) , we performed an unbiased random Tn5 transposon mutagenesis screen . 
We generated a ΔrfaG Salmonella strain that harbored a ﬂiL-lacZ transcriptional fusion to report ﬂagellar gene expression from a class 2 promoter . 
On lactose ( Lac ) indicator media , a ΔrfaG mutant displayed a Lac-negative ( Lac ) phenotype , whereas the Wt strain was Lac . 
This reporter strain allowed us to screen a pool of Tn5 insertion mutants for restored ﬂagellar class 2 gene expression in the ΔrfaG mutant . 
A nonsaturating screen of approximately 9,000 Tn5 insertions identiﬁed seven transposon insertions that displayed a Lac phenotype . 
Four Lac transposon insertions were found in close proximity to the rﬂP and clpX loci ( Fig. 4B ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . 
RﬂP and ClpXP are known factors involved in posttranscriptional regulation of FlhD4C2 ( 12 , 13 ) . 
From these results , we hypothesized that a signal reporting cell envelope stress would activate RﬂP and would thereby cause proteolytic degradation of FlhD4C2 . 
We therefore deleted the rﬂP gene to conﬁrm the role of RﬂP as the key regulator responsible for downregulation of ﬂagellar class 2 gene expression under cell envelope stress conditions . 
Consistent with our hypothesis , motility , ﬂagellum synthesis , and expression of the ﬂagellin FliC were partially restored in the double deletion mutant ΔrfaG ΔrﬂP ( Fig. 4C to E ) . 
In accordance with our hypothesis , the stability of epitope-tagged FlhC protein after arrest of de novo protein synthesis was increased in a ΔrfaG ΔrﬂP double mutant compared to the ΔrfaG single mutant ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Importantly , motility was restored to a similar extent in a ΔrfaG ΔclpX double mutant ( Fig .

B ) . 
An increase in ﬂagellum synthesis was also observed for double mutant ΔrfaL ΔrﬂP . 
However , aggregation of bacterial cell bodies prevented a quantitative analysis of the motility phenotype ( Fig . 
S3C and D ) . 
As mentioned above , we speculated that cell envelope perturbations result in activation of rﬂP gene expression . 
Thus , we determined the transcript levels of rﬂP in the LPS truncation mutants using RT-qPCR . 
As expected , we detected increased rﬂP gene expression in the LPS truncation mutants which correlated with increased levels of cell envelope stress ( Fig. 5A ; see also Fig . 
S3E ) . 
Complementation of ΔrfaG or ΔrfaD mutants reduced rﬂP expression to Wt levels ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Addition of 1 mM EDTA also increased transcriptional activation of rﬂP 4-fold to 5-fold compared to the untreated control results , and the level of activation resembled that of rﬂP expression in the ΔrfaG mutant ( Fig. 5C ) . 
EDTA and EGTA are known magnesium ( Mg2 ) and calcium ( Ca2 ) chelators , and depletion of Mg2 induces Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI-2 ) virulence gene expression in Salmonella via the PhoP-PhoQ two-component system ( TCS ) ( 32 ) . 
To test if enhanced virulence gene expression in response to low Mg2 levels contributes to the observed upregulation of rﬂP upon addition of chelators , we tested rﬂP gene expression in mutants that lacked major Salmonella pathogenicity islands SPI-1 and SPI-2 . 
When challenged with EDTA , rﬂP was upregulated in all tested strains to an extent similar to that determined for the Wt . 
From this , we concluded that activation of the PhoP-PhoQ system does not contribute to the observed motility defect under conditions of outer membrane perturbation ( Fig. 5D ) . 
A variety of chemical and biological agents may induce cell envelope stress . 
Therefore , we challenged Wt Salmonella with cell envelope-acting compounds . 
These included EGTA , acidic pH , antimicrobials such as polymyxin B or ampicillin , detergents ( Triton-X and SDS ) , and the ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone ( CCCP ) . 
In addition , the effects of the complement system in human serum as part of the innate immune system were tested . 
Addition of EGTA , the complement system , and pH 4 , but not addition of detergents , polymyxin B , ampicillin , and pH 5 , affected rﬂP expression . 
This suggested that the activation of rﬂP expression responded to speciﬁc cell envelope stress pathways ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Transcriptome analysis revealed the involvement of 24 in activation of rﬂP expression . 
We next analyzed the transcriptome of ΔrfaL , ΔrfaG , and ΔrfaD LPS truncation mutants to elucidate the regulatory link between RﬂP and cell envelope stress . 
Principal-component analysis indicated that the gene expression proﬁles of the ΔrfaG and ΔrfaD mutants were distinct from those of the ΔrfaL mutant and Wt Salmonella ( Fig. 7A ; see also Fig . 
S4 ) . 
Differential gene expression analysis revealed 217 differentially regulated genes in the ΔrfaL mutant ( 136 upregulated and 81 downregulated ) , 716 in the ΔrfaG mutant ( 232 upregulated and 484 downregulated ) , and 619 in the ΔrfaD mutant ( 201 upregulated and 418 downregulated ) in comparison to the Wt ( Fig. 7B ; see also Table S2 ) . 
KEGG pathway analysis conﬁrmed the downregulation of ﬂagellar , chemotaxis , and ﬁmbrial genes in the ΔrfaG and ΔrfaD mutants . 
Interestingly , the virulence-associated injectisome systems and effector proteins encoded on SPI-1 and SPI-2 were also strongly downregulated in rfaG-deﬁcient and rfaD-deﬁcient bacteria ( Fig . 
S5 ) . 
Further , analysis of differentially regulated genes showed downregulation of metabolic genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle and upregulation of tRNA synthesis genes . 
An operon encoding a putative signal transduction system ( S. Typhimurium 4310 [ STM4310 ] to STM4315 ) was strongly downregulated in the ΔrfaD and ΔrfaG mutants . 
Also , the sdiA quorum sensing regulator gene was profoundly downregulated ( for mutant ΔrfaG , log2 fold change [ log2FC ] 3.04 ; for mutant ΔrfaD , log2FC 3.87 ) . 
Components of the FOF1 ATPase , such as atpA , were downregulated in the LPS truncation mutants ( for mutant ΔrfaG , log2FC 1 ; for mutant ΔrfaD , log2FC 1.9 ) ( Fig. 7C ) . 
The idea of possible involvement of expression of the ATP synthase in cell envelope stress-mediated downregulation of ﬂagella was supported by our Tn5 mutagenesis results . 
Two Lac insertions were found disrupting atpD , the - subunit of the FOF1 ATPase . 
However , how production of the ATPase affects ﬂagellar gene expression under cell envelope stress conditions remains to be elucidated ( Fig. 4B ; see also Table S2 ) . 
Corroborating our previous results , clpX and rﬂP were upregulated in the LPS truncation mutants . 
Interestingly , nlpC transcription was also slightly enhanced in the mutants ( for mutant ΔrfaD , log2FC 1.7 ; for mutant ΔrfaG , log2FC 1.9 ) . 
The thus-far-uncharacterized NlpC lipoprotein is encoded directly upstream of rﬂP , and we isolated Lac insertions in nlpC in our Tn5 transposon screen . 
Insertions in nlpC were previously found in another transposon screen , where RﬂP was shown to be upregulated under starvation conditions ( 13 ) . 
These ﬁndings suggested a potential regulatory connection between NlpC and RﬂP . 
We further found that RstA , the response regulator of the Rst two-component system ( TCS ) , was upregulated in the LPS truncation mutants ( for mutant ΔrfaD , log2FC 1.91 ; for mutant ΔrfaG , log2FC 1.64 ) . 
Overexpression of RstA induces degradation of 38 ( RpoS ) and alters bioﬁlm formation , and the Rst TCS promotes expression of an iron transport protein , FeoB , under iron-replete conditions ( 33 , 34 ) . 
However , we found that feoAB and ﬁmbriae , as important bioﬁlm-associated factors , were downregulated in the transcriptome of the LPS truncation mutants . 
We next analyzed the transcriptome with respect to known cell envelope stress sensing systems . 
The phage-shock-protein ( Psp ) response system is a regulatory system which senses cell envelope perturbations . 
The Psp system is activated by alterations of the proton motif force ( pmf ) , which result in upregulation of the pspABCDE operon and pspG in a 54-dependent manner ( 20 , 21 ) . 
However , our transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of the phage-shock response components pspABC in the LPS truncation mutants ( e.g. , for pspA , ΔrfaD mutant log2FC 1.74 and ΔrfaG mutant log2FC 2.08 ) indicating that this pathway is not relevant in that context . 
Consistently , disruption of the pmf using the CCCP uncoupler did not increase rﬂP expression ( Fig. 6A ) . 
Another TCS that senses and responds to cell envelope stress is CpxRA . 
The Cpx response is activated by adhesion ; pH stress ; or aggregated , misfolded periplasmic proteins . 
Under stress conditions , the CpxR-P phosphorylated response regulator negatively regulates genes coding for the stress - factor 24 ( rpoE ) and the related cell envelope TCS ( rseABC ) . 
It positively regulates genes cpxP and degP coding for the negative regulator ( 20 ) . 
DegP has been shown to degrade misfolded periplasmic proteins , and its transcription is positively inﬂuenced by the stress - factor 24 ( 35 ) . 
We did not ﬁnd any upregulation of cpxRA , but transcription of negative regulator gene cpxP ( ΔrfaD mutant log2FC 2.76 ; ΔrfaG mutant log2FC 1.79 ) and periplasmic endoprotease gene degP ( ΔrfaD mutant log2FC 2.48 ) was enhanced . 
Notably , we found signiﬁcant upregulation of the well-known Rse / 24 pathway ( for rpoE , ΔrfaD mutant log2FC 2.46 and ΔrfaG mutant log2FC 1.87 ) . 
The 24 cell envelope stress response is primarily activated by misfolded outer membrane proteins in the periplasm ( 20 ) . 
When these proteins are present , inner membrane-bound RseA is cleaved , resulting in release of 24 into the cytosol . 
24 then induces expression of the downstream genes , including rpoE , rseABC , and degP . 
The Rcs phosphorelay system is also known to respond to envelope stress ( 21 , 36 , 37 ) . 
It was reported recently that RcsF monitors lateral interactions between LPS molecules . 
Upon disruption by cationic antimicrobial peptides such as polymyxin B resulting from loss of negatively charged phosphate groups on the LPS , the Rcs system activates the cell envelope stress response ( 30 , 38 ) . 
However , no Rcs-regulated genes were found to be differentially expressed in the transcriptome of the analyzed LPS mutants . 
Furthermore , polymyxin B had no effect on the upregulation of rﬂP ( Fig. 6B ) . 
EDTA-mediated cell envelope stress is transmitted via 24 and the Rcs phosphorelay to upregulate rﬂP expression . 
The transcriptome analyses suggested that the Cpx cell envelope stress sensing system , as well as other factors or cell envelope stress sensing systems , may be involved in transcriptional activation of rﬂP . 
Thus , we next determined rﬂP expression levels upon addition of EDTA in various deletion mutants with respect to regulatory pathways putatively involved in rﬂP regulation . 
Growth of the TCS deletion mutants was not affected compared to that seen with the Wt ( Fig . 
S5 ) . 
Notably , rﬂP levels increased only slightly in the rpoE mutant under EDTA stress conditions , indicating that 24 is involved in induction of rﬂP under cell envelope stress conditions . 
However , none of the tested regulatory pathways mutants displayed rﬂP expression levels comparable to those seen under the nonstimulated Wt conditions ( Fig. 7D ) . 
As stated above , the Rcs phosphorelay system has been shown to be involved in downregulation of motility upon disruption of the LPS in E. coli . 
Consistent with the previous ﬁndings in E. coli , the motility defect of a ΔrfaG mutant was rescued by additional deletion of rcsD or rcsDBC ( Fig. 8A ) . 
To test whether the Rcs system is also involved in general upregulation of rﬂP expression under conditions of EDTA-mediated envelope stress , we determined rﬂP expression levels in a ΔrcsDBC mutant . 
Similarly to the phenotype of the rpoE mutant , rﬂP levels were enhanced only slightly under cell envelope stress conditions ( Fig. 7D ) . 
The RcsB response regulator is phosphorylated upon activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system . 
We thus monitored rﬂP gene expression in a RcsB mutant that mimics phosphorylation ( RcsBD56E ) and in a mutant that prevents phosphorylation ( RcsBD56N ) ( 39 ) . 
The RcsBD56N ( RcsBOFF ) mutant failed to upregulate rﬂP expression under EDTA stress conditions compared to the Wt or the RcsBD56E ( RcsBON ) mutant ( Fig. 8B ) .

FIG 9 Model of envelope stress-mediated downregulation of ﬂagellar gene expression . 
Cell envelope stress signals are sensed in the LPS mutant background by various sensory systems located in the membrane . 
The signal may be transmitted ( i ) directly via the alternative cell envelope stress sigma factor 24 , which is encoded by the rpoE gene , ( ii ) indirectly by enhancing transcription of rpoE , ( iii ) via the Rcs signaling pathway by phosphorylating RcsB , or ( iv ) via an unknown sensor and signaling pathway . 
RﬂP expression is then increased directly by 24 via the activity of a 24 binding sequence in the promoter region of rﬂP , by direct or indirect induction by RcsB-P , or by other factors . 
Increased levels of RﬂP protein led to degradation of the ﬂagellar master regulator protein complex FlhD4C2 via ClpXP protease and subsequent downregulation of ﬂagellar synthesis . 
Genes are indicated by gray boxes , and gene names are in italics . 
Notably , a double mutant with mutations of both the Rcs system and stress sigma factor 24 ( ΔrcsDBC ΔrpoE ) did not activate rﬂP transcription under EDTA stress conditions ( Fig. 8B ) . 
These results suggest that activation of both the Rcs phosphorelay system and the Rse / 24 pathway is needed for full activation of rﬂP expression . 
We thus conclude that several redundant cell envelope sensing systems transmit and integrate signals corresponding to alterations of the cell envelope at the level of rﬂP expression , ultimately resulting in repression of ﬂagellum production ( Fig. 9 ) . 
DISCUSSION
During host infection , Salmonella survives and replicates in vastly different anatomical compartments , such as in the gastrointestinal lumen or inside acidic host cell vacuoles , termed Salmonella-containing vacuoles ( SCV ) . 
Accordingly , the bacteria employ a variety of sophisticated sensory systems and complex regulatory mechanisms to identify the spatiotemporal stage of infection and adapt to the various stressful environments . 
In particular , ﬂagellum-mediated motility allows directed movement in the intestinal lumen but might be detrimental in later stages of infection or during intracellular survival . 
Biosynthesis of the large extracellular ﬂagellar ﬁlament represents a serious metabolic burden and , in addition , constitutes a prime target for the immune system . 
Thus , bacteria tightly regulate ﬂagellar biosynthesis in response to a plethora of environmental signals ( 5 ) . 
Here , we demonstrated that Salmonella senses various types of cell envelope stress , which subsequently trigger downregulation of motility and ﬂagellar synthesis . 
Perturbations of the LPS structure exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the expression of ﬂagellar genes from class 2 and class 3 promoters and a weak effect on the class 1 promoter that drives expression of the master regulatory operon , ﬂhDC . 
Importantly , we found that ﬂagellar gene expression was downregulated in the LPS truncation mutants primarily due to posttranscriptional regulation at the level of the FlhD4C2 complex . 
Using an unbiased transposon mutagenesis approach , we identiﬁed the previously described anti-FlhD4C2 factor RﬂP as a key regulatory protein involved in downregulation of ﬂagellar gene expression in the LPS truncation mutants . 
Importantly , we also found the ClpXP protease to be involved in this process . 
RﬂP-ClpXP-mediated regulation of FlhD4C2 is well established ; RﬂP binds to the FlhD subunit and directs the master regulator FlhD4C2 with respect to ClpXP-dependent proteolytic degradation ( 12 , 15 ) . 
Thus , mutations in rﬂP or clpXP stabilize the FlhD4C2 protein complex and allow ﬂagellar gene expression from class 2 promoters . 
One of the major functions of the LPS layer is to control the stability of the outer membrane . 
Depletion of the LPS results in perturbations of the OM , which ultimately leads to leakage of periplasmic content into the extracellular space ( 22 ) . 
Moreover , the composition of the OM is altered in LPS truncation mutants ( 22 ) . 
In agreement with an earlier study ( 25 ) , we argued that neither the altered LPS structure per se nor the mutated genes for LPS biosynthesis are directly responsible for the observed motility defect . 
Rather , we presumed that the alteration of LPS moieties caused general perturbations of the OM , which induced a general cell envelope stress response . 
For E. coli , it has been shown that the Rcs phosphorelay system , which senses outer membrane perturbations , is involved in the downregulation of ﬂagella in LPS-defective mutants ( 25 ) . 
Consistently , we found that the Rcs pathway upregulates rﬂP expression under EDTA envelope stress conditions and that this process depends on the phosphorylation state of the RcsB response regulator ( Fig. 8B ) . 
We further analyzed the induction of cell envelope sensory systems in more detail using transcriptome sequencing ( RNA-seq ) - based analysis and found signiﬁcant upregulation of the Rse / 24 pathway . 
The 24 cell envelope stress response is primarily activated by the activity of misfolded outer membrane proteins in the periplasm ( 20 ) . 
Activation of this pathway in the LPS mutants can be explained by the fact that the LPS subunits are synthesized but are not cross-linked and thus may accumulate in the periplasm . 
Interestingly , an rpoE deletion mutant was unable to upregulate rﬂP under conditions that perturbed the OM integrity using EDTA ( Fig. 6 ) . 
This result further conﬁrmed the involvement of the 24-dependent cell envelope stress response in downregulation of motility . 
We also found that additional pathways besides ﬂagellar motility and chemotaxis were downregulated in the LPS truncation mutants , in particular , pathways involving SPI-1 - and SPI-2-associated genes , type I ﬁmbriae , and the TCA cycle . 
In contrast , positively regulated genes were mapped to regulatory cascades and metabolic pathways . 
Interestingly , similar drastic changes in the gene expression patterns of ﬂagella and chemotaxis genes were observed in E. coli when LPS synthesis was disrupted ( 40 ) . 
This indicated that the existence of a nonmotile phenotype under envelope stress conditions is not restricted to Salmonella Typhimurium but might be a more general principle in gammaproteobacteria ( 40 ) . 
Downregulation of the virulence-associated SPI-1 injectisome system might be connected to downregulation of the ﬂagellar gene encoding FliZ . 
FliZ is needed for activation of the SPI-1-encoded injectisome in that it stabilizes the HilD SPI-1 master regulator ( 41 ) . 
As mentioned , Salmonella encounters various types of cell envelope stress during the course of infection . 
Upon Salmonella ingestion , antimicrobial peptides challenge the bacteria in the saliva . 
The bacteria travel through the digestive tract and encounter acidic pH in the stomach and bile salts before Salmonella reaches the intestine . 
In the intestine , antimicrobial peptides and the host microbiota and their products challenge the invading pathogen . 
Once Salmonella has breached the intestinal epithelial border , serum complement , as part of the immune system , attacks the bacteria . 
In the deeper organs , besides phagocytic cells , antimicrobial peptides and an acidic pH are found ( 42 , 43 ) . 
We thus tested ﬂagellation and upregulation of rﬂP upon addition of EDTA , acidic pH , or serum complement as alternative means to induce cell envelope stress . 
EDTA is a chelator of positive metal ions such as Mg2 and disrupts the OM ( 38 ) , while pore formation mediated by the complement system might also induce the cell envelope stress response by perforation of the inner membrane ( 44 ) . 
Expression of rﬂP was signiﬁcantly upregulated by addition of EDTA and the complement but not by anti-microbials or detergents . 
In summary , our results indicate that Salmonella responds to different types of envelope stress and might use these stresses as cues to determine the spatiotemporal stage of infection . 
At certain stages of the infection , it might be beneﬁcial for Salmo-nella to downregulate ﬂagellar synthesis in order to escape recognition by the immune system . 
In this respect , it appears possible that rﬂP is upregulated within the Salmonella-containing vacuole in response to cell envelope stress and limited nutrient levels . 
Consistently , upregulation of rﬂP under conditions that mimic spi-2 induction , as well as under starvation conditions , was reported before ( 13 , 45 ) . 
The various cell envelope stress signals would then result in activation of 24 and the Rcs phosphorelay system , which in turn would increase expression of RﬂP . 
In support of that idea , a bioinformatics analysis of the rﬂP promoter region in E. coli suggested the presence of a putative 24 binding sequence in the intergenic region between nlpC and rﬂP ( 46 ) . 
After 24-dependent activation of rﬂP gene expression , the RﬂP protein would subsequently target the ﬂagellar master regulatory complex FlhD4C2 to ClpXP-mediated proteolysis and thereby downregulate ﬂagellar synthesis ( Fig. 8 ) .
