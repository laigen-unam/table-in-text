ABSTRACT : Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 catabolizes propionate through the 2-methylcitric acid cycle , but the identity of the enzymes catalyzing the conversion of 2-methylcitrate into 2-methyl-isocitrate is unclear . 
This work shows that the prpD gene of the prpBCDE operon of this bacterium encodes a protein with 2-methylcitrate dehydratase enzyme activity . 
Homogeneous PrpD enzyme did not contain an iron-sulfur center , displayed no requirements for metal cations or reducing agents for activity , and did not catalyze the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate to 2-methylisocitrate . 
It was concluded that the gene encoding the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase enzyme is encoded outside the prpBCDE operon . 
Computer analysis of bacterial genome databases identified the presence of orthologues of the acnA gene ( encodes aconitase A ) in a number of putative prp operons . 
Homogeneous AcnA protein of S. enterica had strong aconitase activity and catalyzed the hydration of the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate to yield 2-methylisocitrate . 
The purification of this enzyme allows the complete reconstitution of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle in vitro using homogeneous preparations of the PrpE , PrpC , PrpD , AcnA , and PrpB enzymes . 
However , inactivation of the acnA gene did not block growth of S. enterica on propionate as carbon and energy source . 
The existence of a redundant aconitase activity ( encoded by acnB ) was postulated to be responsible for the lack of a phenotype in acnA mutant strains . 
Consistent with this hypothesis , homogeneous AcnB protein of S. enterica also had strong aconitase activity and catalyzed the conversion of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate into 2-methylisocitrate . 
To address the involvement of AcnB in propionate catabolism , an acnA and acnB double mutant was constructed , and this mutant strain can not grow on propionate even when supplemented with glutamate . 
The phenotype of this double mutant indicates that the aconitase enzymes are required for the 2-methylcitric acid cycle during propionate catabolism . 
In Salmonella enterica , propionate is oxidized to pyruvate via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle ( Figure 1 ) . 
In this bacterium , functions encoded by the prpBCDE operon are required to catalyze the reactions in this pathway ( 1 , 2 ) . 
The first two steps of the pathway convert propionate to 2-methylcitrate by the sequential action of the propionyl-CoA synthetase ( PrpE ) 1 and 2-methylcitrate synthase ( PrpC ) enzymes ( 2 , 3 ) . 
The last step of the methylcitric acid cycle , i.e. , the cleavage of 2-methylisocitrate into pyruvate and succinate , is catalyzed by the 2-methylisocitrate lyase ( PrpB ) enzyme ( T. L. Grimek

The work reported herein was undertaken because the enzyme ( s ) responsible for the conversion of 2-methylcitrate to 2-meth-ylisocitrate and the role of the PrpD protein in this pathway were unknown . 
Previous studies showed that 2-methylcitrate accumulated in prpD mutant strains of S. enterica during growth on propionate ( 2 ) , suggesting the involvement of the PrpD protein in the conversion of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methylisocitrate . 
This reaction is reminiscent of the citrate to isocitrate conversion catalyzed by aconitase . 
Interestingly , the PrpD protein shows no homology to proteins of known function ( 1 ) including aconitases , suggesting that PrpD is either a novel aconitase , or it is a new enzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate , or the hydration of the latter to 2-methylisocitrate . 
If PrpD catalyzed only one of the steps in the conversion of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methylisocitrate , one would have to conclude that the enzyme catalyzing the remaining hydration step would be encoded by a gene outside of the prpBCDE operon . 
In this report , results of in vitro experiments addressing the role of the PrpD protein in propionate catabolism are presented . 
These experiments were performed with homogeneous preparations of PrpB , PrpC , PrpD , and PrpE enzymes , and the breakdown of [ 2-13C ] propionate was monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy . 
The data showed that the PrpD protein dehydrated 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate but did not convert the latter to 2-methylisoci-trate , i.e. , PrpD did not have aconitase-like activity . 
On the basis of information obtained by computer analysis of genome databases , it was hypothesized that the aconitase A ( AcnA ) enzyme was responsible for the hydration of 2-meth-yl-cis-aconitate to 2-methylisocitrate . 
This idea was further supported by previous reports of this activity being associated with eucaryotic aconitases ( 4 , 5 ) . 
Experiments with homogeneous preparations of enzymes established that both the AcnA and the AcnB proteins from S. enterica had 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity . 
It is clear that in S. enterica the conversion of 2-methyl-citrate to 2-methylisocitrate is performed by two separate enzymes . 
Genetic studies suggest that AcnB is the primary enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate during growth of the cell on propionate . 
The existence of a 2-methyl-cis-aconitate-specific hydratase in this bacterium is currently being explored .

For overexpression , 20 mL of an LB-grown overnight culture of JE4744 was used to inoculate 2 L of LB broth with Ap . 
The culture was grown with shaking at 30 °C to an absorbance of 0.5-0 .6 at 600 nm , isopropyl-â-D-thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM , and the culture was incubated 3 h with shaking at 30 °C . 
Cells were harvested in 250-mL Nalgene polypro-pylene copolymer bottles ( Fisher Scientific ) bottles by centrifugation for 10 min at 10500g , 4 °C with a SS34 rotor in a RC-5B refrigerated centrifuge ( DuPont , Wilmington , DE ) .

Plasmid pACN11 was introduced into E. coli strain ER2566 by transformation , and the resulting strain , JE5253 , was used to overexpress and purify AcnA . 
During this purification , the manufacturer 's instructions were modified due to poor solubility of H6AcnA and its low affinity for the His ‚ Bind resin . 
For overexpression , 5 mL of an overnight culture of JE5253 was used to inoculate 0.25 L of LB broth with Ap . 
The culture was grown at 20 °C with shaking , to an absorbance of 0.5-0 .6 at 600 nm . 
IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM , and the culture was incubated another 15 h with shaking at 20 °C . 
Cells were harvested as described above and washed with 200 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer , pH 8.0 , with 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM imidazole . 
Cells were broken immediately with a French press , and insoluble material removed as described for H6PrpD . 
Cellfree extracts were treated with EDTA and potassium ferricyanide to remove all metal ions as described ( 24 ) . 
The treated extract was immediately dialyzed at 4 °C into 2 L of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer , pH 8.0 , with 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM imidazole . 
The buffer was changed at 2 h , and dialysis was continued overnight . 
The dialyzed extract was mixed with a 20-mL suspension of His ‚ Bind resin ( 5 mL of resin ) equilibrated in dialysis buffer .

To confirm the identity of the 13C NMR peaks , proton-coupled spectra were obtained in all experiments described below . 
Although these spectra are not shown , they are available upon request . 
Glycerol was present in all protein samples and was observed in the spectra due to natural abundance 13C NMR .

RESULTS
PrpD Has 2-Methylcitrate Dehydratase ActiVity . 
It was previously observed that [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate accumulated in prpD missense mutant strains during growth of S. enterica on [ 2-13C ] propionate ( 2 ) . 
This finding suggested that 2-methylcitrate is the substrate for the PrpD enzyme . 
Previous results indicated that 2-methylcitrate was further catabolized in S. enterica to 2-methylisocitrate via a 2-meth-yl-cis-aconitate intermediate . 
It was concluded that the PrpD protein was required for the conversion of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methylisocitrate , but it was unclear which of the two reactions needed for this conversion was catalyzed by PrpD ( 2 ) . 
To address these questions , the prpD gene was overexpressed and its gene product was isolated with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag to facilitate its purification by nickel affinity chromatography ( Figure 2 , lane 3 ) . 
13 To test the activity of H6PrpD , we synthesized [ 2 - C ] - methylcitrate using pure preparations of the PrpE and 13 H6PrpC enzymes and monitored the reactions with C NMR ( Figure 3 ) . 
Initially , PrpE was used to convert [ 2-13C ] -13 propionate ( 30.8 ppm ) to [ 2 - C ] propionyl-CoA ( 37.2 ppm ) . 
Since CoA was limiting , complete conversion to propionylCoA was not observed . 
An unknown peak at 28.9 ppm was observed ( Figure 3 , panel A ) , and it was tentatively identified as propionyl-AMP , a proposed intermediate of the reaction catalyzed by PrpE , the propionyl-CoA synthetase . 
H6PrpC 13 and oxaloacetate were added to convert [ 2 - C ] propionyl-13 CoA ( 37.2 ppm ) to [ 2 - C ] methylcitrate ( 47.5 ppm ) . 
After the reaction was completed , H6PrpD was added to the sample 13 and activity was monitored again by C NMR . 
Approximately 50 % of the [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate was converted to 13 [ 2 - C ] methyl-cis-aconitate ( 141.5 ppm ) during a 30 min incubation at 37 °C ( Figure 3 , panel C ) . 
Proton-coupled 13 spectra verified the labeled carbon [ 2 - C ] methyl-cis-aconi-tate had no attached hydrogens as expected ( data not shown ) . 
This observation provided the first evidence that PrpD had 2-methylcitrate dehydratase activity . 
The [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate / [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate ratio for the PrpD reaction was also obtained under quantitative 13C NMR conditions . 
[ 2-13C ] Methylcitrate was synthesized with PrpE and H PrpC protein at pH 7.5 as described under 6 Experimental Procedures . 
H6PrpD protein was added to the mixture , and the reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 15 h at room temperature . 
13C NMR spectra were obtained without nuclear overhauser enhancement ( NOE ) to allow accurate peak integration . 
The [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate / [ 2-13C ] - methyl-cis-aconitate ratio was 1:1.08 , indicating 52 % of the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate was present at equilibrium under these reaction conditions . 
The chemical shifts of 47.5 ppm for [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate and 141.5 ppm for [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate were slightly different than the 48.8 and 140.5 ppm values previously reported ( 2 ) . 
The difference was due to the presence of excess Mg2 + in the samples for the propionylCoA synthetase reaction . 
Tricarboxylic acids are known to chelate Mg2 + ions , resulting in altered chemical shifts in the 13C NMR spectrum . 
The chemical shifts previously observed were readily obtained after the addition of EDTA to remove the Mg2 + ions ( data not shown ) . 
Does PrpD Catalyze the Hydration of 2-Methyl-cis-aconitate ? 
Although PrpD did not synthesize 2-methylisoci-trate during our initial 13C NMR experiments , it was possible that the conditions used were unfavorable for PrpD t the four 2-methylcitrate stereoisomers present in the mixture or if any of the stereoisomers inhibits enzyme activity . 
Structurally similar substrates such as citrate were tested with H6PrpD . 
Citrate was a poor substrate ( specific activity of 0.2 µmol min-1 mg-1 ) , and isocitrate was not a substrate for H6PrpD . 
However , H6PrpD hydrated cis-aconitate at a rate of 2.6 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 , a specific activity that compared well to the value measured with 2-methylci-trate . 
H6PrpD showed no requirement for reducing agents or divalent metal cations . 
Taken together , these results led to the conclusion that H6PrpD had 2-methylcitrate dehydratase activity , and this enzyme did not require an ironsulfur center for activity . 
What Enzyme Catalyzes the Hydration of 2-Methyl-cis-aconitate ? 
If PrpD did not hydrate 2-methyl-cis-aconitate , a gene outside of the prp operon in S. enterica must encode the missing hydratase enzyme . 
Aconitases from mammals and the fungi Yarrowia ( formerly Saccharomycopis ) lipolytica have been shown to catalyze the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate , which suggested the S. enterica aconitase ( s ) may do the same ( 4 , 5 , 33 ) . 
E. coli has two aconitase genes , acnA and acnB ( 34 , 35 ) , and sequence comparisons to the partial genome database of S. enterica identified homologues for both genes ( see Experimental Procedures ) . 
There is no evidence in E. coli or S. enterica to suggest these enzymes play a role in propionate catabolism . 
However , sequence analysis of other procaryotic genomes suggested the acnA function might be involved in propionate breakdown . 
This gene was found in operons of prp gene homologues in B. pertussis , N. meningitidis , P. aeruginosa , P. putida , and V. cholerae ( Figure 4 ) . 
The acnA homologue found in the pr operons of these procaryotes was named acnD because B. pertussis , P. aeruginosa , and P. putida have additional acnA homologues elsewhere in their genomes . 
The S. enterica aconitase A protein is only 17 % identical to aconitase B ( acnB ) , a fact that allows the acnA homologues to be distinguished from acnB homologues ( 34 ) . 
The Prp proteins and AcnA of these bacteria were at least 70 % identical to the S. enterica enzymes , suggesting that they catalyze the same reactions . 
This finding strongly suggested the AcnA protein of S. enterica was involved in propionate breakdown . 
To address this question , the aconitase A protein of S. enterica was biochemically and genetically characterized . 
H6AcnA Has 2-Methyl-cis-aconitate Hydratase ActiVity . 
S. enterica H6AcnA protein was purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography ( see Experimental Procedures , Figure 2 , lane 5 ) . 
The protein was isolated in its apo form to > 95 % homogeneity . 
Before use , apo-H6AcnA was reactivated anoxically . 
The specific activity of reactivated H6AcnA was very reproducible and ranged from 57 to 63 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 . 
The specific activity of the S. enterica H6AcnA was very similar to the one reported for E. coli AcnA [ 59 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 ] ( 36 ) . 
This was interpreted to mean that the histidine tag had no deleterious effect on the activity of the enzyme . 
Results of 13C NMR experiments designed to test if H6AcnA had 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity are shown in Figure 5 , panel A. Under the conditions used , H6AcnA converted [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate ( 141.5 ppm ) into [ 2-13C ] methylisocitrate ( 76.8 ppm ) . 
Proton-coupled spectra verified the labeled carbon [ 2-13C ] methylisocitrate had no attached hydrogens as expected ( data not shown ) . 
Formation of 2-methylisocitrate was further verified by the addition of H6PrpB to the assay mixture ( Figure 5 , panel B ) . 
H6PrpB cleaved [ 2-13C ] methylisocitrate ( 76.8 ppm ) into [ 2-13C ] pyruvate ( 205.4 ppm ) and succinate as expected ( Grimek and Escalante-Semerena , unpublished results ) . 
Together , these experiments demonstrated that H6AcnA could catalyze the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate . 
Further , the demonstration that H6AcnA catalyzed this reaction allowed the reconstitution of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle in vitro , that is , [ 2-13C ] propionate was oxidized to [ 2-13C ] pyruvate using homogeneous preparations of the PrpE , H6PrpC , H6PrpD , H6AcnA , and H6PrpB enzymes . 
Quantitative 13C NMR experiments were performed with H6AcnA to determine the ratio of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate / 2-methylisocitrate at equilibrium . 
The data showed a ratio of 1:1.37 , i.e. , 58 % of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate was converted to 2-methylisocitrate . 
This result compared favorably to experiments with beef liver aconitase , where 57 % of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate was converted to 2-methylisocitrate at pH 7.5 ( 4 ) . 
In contrast , the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase of Y. lipolytica converted 92 % of the aconitate to 2-methylisoci-trate at pH 7.0 ( 28 ) . 
Surprisingly , we found that [ 2-13C ] methylcitrate produced by H6PrpC was a substrate , albeit a very poor one , for H6AcnA ( data not shown ) . 
This result was in contrast with previous findings with eucaryotic aconitases , for which 13 2-methylcitrate was not a substrate at all ( 4 , 5 ) . 
The [ 2 - C ] - methylisocitrate made by H6AcnA was readily converted into [ 2-13C ] pyruvate and succinate by H6PrpB ( data not shown ) . 
In ViVo Assessment of the Requirement for Aconitase A during Propionate Catabolism . 
To construct an acnA mutation , the gene was PCR amplified and cloned . 
The acnA gene was inactivated by inserting kanamycin and chloramphenicol cassettes into the BamHI and ClaI sites of acnA , removing 650 bp from the middle of the gene . 
The acnA1 : : kan + element was moved onto the chromosome using the gene-replacement vector pMAK705 ( 16 ) . 
The acnA2 : : cat + element was moved onto the chromosome using a temperaturesensitive DNA polymerase I mutant ( see Materials and Methods ) . 
Putative acnA1 : : kan + and acnA2 : : cat + mutant strains were identified by the increased size of the PCR-amplified product . 
Comparisons to the E. coli genome predicted that in S. enterica the acnA gene would be cotransducible with the cobA gene by phage P22 ( 15 ) . 
Indeed , the acnA1 : : kan + and acnA2 : : cat + elements were approximately 30 % co-transducible with cobA , confirming the presence of a chromosomal mutation . 
The location of the acnA1 : : kan + and acnA2 : : cat + elements were verified by determining the sequence flanking the chromosomal insertion . 
The bona fide acnA mutants were used to test the predicted involvement of the AcnA protein in propionate catabolism . 
The acnA mutant strains JE5216 and JE5991 were tested for growth deficiencies on propionate and other carbon sources including acetate , succinate , glycerol , and glucose . 
Under the growth conditions tested , no phenotypes were observed when compared to an acnA + strain ( TR6583 ) . 
This result indicated that either AcnA was not required for growth on propionate or that alternative aconitase activities ( e.g. , AcnB ) compensated for the lack of AcnA in the mutant . 
Growth behavior of the S. enterica acnA mutant strains on acetate and glucose was consistent with the one reported for E. coli acnA mutants ( 35 ) . 
H10AcnB Has 2-Methyl-cis-aconitate Hydratase ActiVity . 
The phenotype of an acnA mutation in S. enterica suggested that AcnB may also catalyze the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate . 
To address this question , the S. enterica H10AcnB protein was purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography ( see Experimental Procedures , Figure 2 ) . 
Before use , AcnB was reactivated anoxically . 
The specific activity of reactivated H10AcnB was reproducible and range on propionate even when supplemented with glutamate . 
This result indicated that both aconitases were required for aerobic growth on propionate . 
Further , the acnA acnB double mutant strain was unable to respire propionate under anaerobic growth conditions suggesting that oxygen did not play any role in the observed propionate phenotype . 
Growth behavior of the S. enterica acnB mutant and acnA acnB double mutant strains on acetate and glucose were consistent with those reported for the corresponding E. coli mutants ( 37 ) . 
To demonstrate the aconitase mutations did not affect flanking genes on the chromosome , complementing plasmids for acnA and acnB were constructed ( see Experimental Procedures ) . 
These plasmids complemented the aerobic phenotypes of an acnA acnB double mutant when induced with 1 mM L-arabinose ( data not shown ) . 
FIGURE 3 : The conversion of [ 2-13C ] propionate into [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate by PrpE , H6PrpC , and H6PrpD monitored by 13C NMR . 
The removed portion of the spectra ( 60-73 ppm ) contained only glycerol peaks present in the protein preparations at 62.8 and 72.3 ppm .

catalyze the reaction . 
To displace the equilibrium toward 2-methylisocitrate , homogeneous 2-methylisocitrate lyase , H6PrpB , was added to the reaction mixture . 
The addition of excess H6PrpB protein did not result in the conversion of [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate to [ 2-13C ] pyruvate ( data not shown ) . 
It was also considered that PrpD required an ironsulfur center for activity like an aconitase enzymes , although the PrpD amino acid sequence did not have an iron-sulfur center motif ( 1 ) . 
To test this idea , PrpD was treated with DTT and ( NH4 ) 2Fe ( SO4 ) 2 to reactivate the iron-sulfur center as described for aconitases ( 25 ) and tested for 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity using 13C NMR spectroscopy to monitor the reaction . 
Treated H6PrpD protein converted approximately 50 % of the 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate and no signal for 2-methylisocitrate was detected . 
The addition of H6PrpB to this reaction mixture had no effect on the spectrum ( data not shown ) . 
H6PrpD was also treated under conditions to reconstitute iron-sulfur centers of apo proteins ( 24 ) . 
Again , no change in the spectrum was observed when treated H6PrpD enzyme was used in the experiment ( data not shown ) . 
Further , UV/visible spectra of concentrated H6PrpD did not reveal the expected diagnostic of the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster ( 32 ) . 
H6PrpD enzyme was also tested for 2-methylcitrate dehydratase activity using an in vitro UV assay ( see Experimental Procedures ) . 
The assay used authentic 2-methylcitrate , and H6PrpD activity was monitored by the formation of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate at 240 nm . 
Using this assay , H6PrpD had a specific activity of 2.8 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 . 
This value may be an underestimate of the dehydration rate of the substrate if the enzyme uses as substrate only one of 
FIGURE 4 : A comparison of prp operons from a number of bacteria . 
The operons are grouped by similarities in gene organization , although minor differences exist between each operon in a group . 
ORFS were not drawn exactly to scale due to differences in gene sizes between each species . 
Predicted ORFs from S. typhi , B. pertussis , and P. putida KT2440 are all unfinished genomes and could be subject to change ( see Experimental Procedures ) . 
Sequence information from E. coli , N. meningitidis MC58 , P. aeruginosa PAO1 , and V. cholerae was obtained from published sources ( 15 , 19 , 21 , 22 ) . 
ORFs were named after the S. enterica gene designations except ybhH , yfcA , and ackA ( acetate kinase ) , which were named first in E. coli ( 15 ) . 
The putative ackA gene of N. meningitidis also shows sequence similarity to the propionate kinase tcdD of E. coli ( 15 ) . 
FIGURE 5 : The conversion of [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate to [ 2-13C ] pyruvate by H6AcnA and H6PrpB monitored by 13C NMR .

from 27 to 30 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 . 
This value is close to that reported for E. coli AcnB protein [ 38 µmol min-1 ( mg of protein ) -1 ] ( 34 ) . 
This result was interpreted to mean that the histidine tag had little , if any , deleterious effect on the activity of the enzyme . 
The H10AcnB was tested as a 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase using the same method as H6AcnA ( see Experimental Procedures ) . 
H10AcnB was added to a mixture containing [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate , and the course of the reaction was monitored by 13C NMR . 
After 1 h of incubation , a fraction of the [ 2-13C ] methyl-cis-aconitate was converted to [ 2-13C ] methylisocitrate ( data not shown ) . 
As expected , the addition of H6PrpB to the mixture cleaved [ 2-13C ] methyl-isocitrate into [ 2-13C ] pyruvate and succinate ( data not shown ) . 
These results demonstrated that H10AcnB had 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity and can substitute for AcnA in the 2-methylcitric acid cycle of S. enterica . 
In ViVo Assessment of the Requirement for Aconitase A and B during Propionate Catabolism . 
Since AcnB protein can hydrate 2-methyl-cis-aconitate , the requirements of AcnB during growth on propionate were tested . 
For these experiments , an acnB single mutant and an acnA acnB double mutant were constructed . 
To construct an acnB mutation , the gene was PCR amplified and cloned . 
The acnB gene was inactivated by inserting a kanamycin cassette into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of acnB , removing 2.2 kb from the middle of the gene . 
The acnB3 : : kan + element was moved onto the chromosome as described ( 3 , 16 ) . 
The location of the acnB3 : : kan + element was verified by PCR and sequencing . 
To test the involvement of the aconitases in propionate catabolism , the growth phenotypes of the acnB single mutant ( JE5992 ) and the acnA acnB double mutant ( JE5993 ) strains were tested . 
The acnB mutant strain did not grow on propionate unless glutamate was added to the medium , and the addition of glutamate did not restore growth to the level of an acnB + strain ( TR6583 ) . 
This result indicated that AcnB was the primary aconitase for growth on propionate . 
In addition , the acnB mutant strain did not grow on acetate and citrate and only slight improvements were observed when glutamate was added . 
The acnA acnB double mutant strain did not grow 
DISCUSSION
The 2-methylcitric acid cycle responsible for the conversion of propionate to pyruvate in S. enterica was reconstituted using homogeneous preparations of five enzymes . 
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of the complete reconstitution of this pathway . 
Results from experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the PrpD protein has 2-methylcitrate dehydratase activity . 
It is also shown that the aconitase A and B enzymes can catalyze the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate . 
PrpD Characterization . 
It was not surprising to find out that PrpD could only catalyze one of the two reactions typic-ally catalyzed by aconitases , because PrpD ( 54 kDa ) is significantly smaller than aconitases ( ∼ 100 kDa ) . 
The fact that PrpD could only dehydrate 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate was consistent with the enzymology of the 2-meth-ylcitric acid cycle in Y. lipolytica , a fungus in which separate enzymes catalyze the dehydration and hydration steps of this pathway ( 28 , 33 ) . 
Many properties of the 2-methyl-citrate dehydratase identified in Y. lipolytica are consistent with those of PrpD ( 33 ) . 
For example , isocitrate was not a substrate for PrpD or the enzyme from Y. lipolytica , and neither enzyme demonstrated requirements for metal cations o reducing agents ( 33 ) . 
Unlike the Y. lipolytica 2-methylcitrate dehydratase , PrpD used citrate or cis-aconitate as substrate ( 33 ) . 
Surprisingly , neither the fungal or bacterial enzymes were iron-sulfur proteins , even though most enzymes of the hydro-lyase family do have iron-sulfur centers ( 38 ) . 
The PrpD reaction mechanism may be similar to the fumarase reaction catalyzed by E. coli FumC or other class II fumarases ( 39 , 40 ) . 
These enzymes catalyze the reversible hydration of fumarate to L-malate and display no requirements for metal cations or reducing agents . 
In contrast , the class I fumarases are labile , iron-sulfur proteins ( 38 , 40 ) . 
The related enzyme properties of PrpD and class II fumarases suggests PrpD may proceed through a similar reaction mechanism , although these two different enzymes share no apparent sequence similarity . 
Further characterization of the PrpD enzyme is necessary to clarify this issue . 
Significance of the prpD Sequence . 
The DNA sequence of the prpD gene and the predicted amino acid sequence of its gene product show no similarity to known genes or their encoded proteins . 
This observation is surprising considering the large number of dehydratases with substrates similar to 2-methylcitrate . 
One explanation may be that many dehydratases contain iron-sulfur centers ( 38 ) , although there are dehydratases such as D - ( - ) - tartrate dehydratase from Rhodo-bacter ( formerly Rhodopseudomonas ) sphaeroides and fumarase C from E. coli that are not iron-sulfur enzymes ( 39 , 41 ) . 
PrpD shows striking sequence similarity to a number of hypothetical proteins such as YqiQ from Bacillus subtilis ( GenBank accession 1709059 ) , PDH1 from Saccharomyces cereVisiae ( GenBank accession 6325258 ) , and others ( 1 ) . 
Among the organisms with prpD homologues , only E. coli and S. cereVisiae have been shown to catabolize propionate via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle ( 42-44 ) . 
The uniqueness of the PrpD sequence could be used to search for the 2-meth-ylcitric acid cycle in genomes of organisms , although some procaryotes with prp operons do not have the prpD gene ( Figure 4 ) . 
All of the other enzymes in this pathway show sequence similarity to enzymes that catalyze related reactions . 
Requirements for Aconitase during Growth on Propionate . 
It is intriguing that in several procaryotes , but not in S. enterica , a homologue of the acnA gene ( herein referred to as acnD , Figure 4 ) is found within putative prp operons . 
The absence of the acnA gene in the prpBCDE operon of S. enterica suggests AcnA may have other functions in this bacterium , and thus their syntheses can not be restricted to growth conditions where propionate is available in the environment . 
Additional functions of AcnA are currently unknown . 
Surprisingly , the acnB gene , or a homologue of it , has not been found in any putative prp operon , although it is next to the prp operon in P. putida . 
In studies with E. coli aconitases , AcnA was more oxygen-stable than AcnB ( 32 ) . 
The presence of the acnA homologues , but not acnB , in putative prp operons may reflect a general requirement for propionate catabolism during oxygen stress . 
Further Support for the InVolVement of Aconitase or Another Iron-Sulfur Center-Containing Hydratase . 
Glutathione ( GSH ) is required for the synthesis of active aconitase ( 45 ) . 
In S. enterica , gshA mutants grow poorly on propionate as a sole carbon and energy source ( 46 ) . 
This effect of the lack of GSH on propionate catabolism is consistent with the proposed involvement of aconitases in the breakdown of propionate . 
It is also possible , however , that the lack of GSH affects the activity of an as-yet-unidentified 2-methyl-cis-aconitate specific hydratase . 
Does S. enterica have a specific 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase enzyme ? 
The apparent similarities between the 2-methylcitric acid cycles of S. enterica and Y. lipolytica suggests that like Y. lipolytica , S. enterica may have a specific 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase ( 28 ) . 
However , the growth phentoypes of a S. enterica acnA acnB double mutant indicate aconitases are essential for growth on propionate . 
Considering this result , it seems unlikely that a specific 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase exists in S. enterica . 
It is possible that the pleotrophic growth phenotypes of the S. enterica acnA acnB double mutant is masking the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity . 
Similar pleotrophic phenotypes were observed for E. coli aconitase double mutants ( 37 ) . 
We suspect that genetic approaches for the identification of the gene encoding this putative hydratase would be unsuccessful given the documented activity of AcnA and AcnB and the phenotypes of aconitase mutants . 
Different approaches are needed to investigate the existence of this enzyme in S. enterica . 
Function of the PutatiVe YbhH Enzyme . 
Also of interest is the ybhH gene ( Figure 4 ) found in acnD-containing prp operons . 
It is possible that the YbhH protein has unknown 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity . 
Although it seems redundant to have AcnD in addition to a specific 2-meth-yl-cis-aconitate hydratase in the same operon , there may be advantages to this redundancy . 
For example , sequence analysis suggests that YbhH may not have an iron-sulfur center , which could allow propionate breakdown in iron limiting or highly oxidizing environments . 
This situation would be similar to the presence of three fumarases in E. coli ( 47 ) . 
FumA and FumB are labile , iron-sulfur proteins expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions , respectively ( 40 ) , while FumC lacks an iron-sulfur center and is induced by oxygen stress ( 39 , 48 ) . 
It was surprising that the sequence analysis in S. enterica , S. typhi , and S. paratyphi failed to identify a YbhH homologue . 
If this putative enzyme were the 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase , the lack of this activity would suggest S. enterica catalyzes the reaction solely through AcnA and AcnB . 
It was surprising that , in E. coli , ybhH was located in a three-gene operon with ybhJ , which is predicted to encode a third aconitase ( AcnC ) activity ( 15 , 32 ) . 
The ybhJ gene is also missing in S. enterica .
