Introduction 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes a variety of diseases in humans and animals , ranging from gastroenteritis to systemic infection . 
In humans , gastroenteritis symptoms include fever , nausea , abdominal cramps and diarrhoea . 
The pathophysiology of such localized enteritis is largely characterized by movement of electrolytes and water , as well as to the inﬁltration of large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , which migrate into the intestinal mucosa and lumen from the underlying microvasculature . 
The ability of S. typhimurium to cause disease in humans is related to its acquisition of virulence genes termed pathogenicity islands . 
Encoded on the 40 kb segment of the bacterial chromosome termed Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -1 are 25 virulence genes , which encode structural components and secreted substrates of a type III protein translocation system ( Hueck , 1998 ; Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
Numerous secreted virulence factors , including SopE/E2 , SptP and SopB/SigD , are translocated through the host membrane where they collectively cause actin polymerization , membrane ruffling and Salmonella invasion ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ) . 
In addition , three SPI-1-secreted proteins , SipB , SipC and SipD , facilitate the translocation of secreted effector proteins into the cytosol of mammalian cells ( Hueck et al. , 1995 ; Galyov et al. , 1997 ; Collazo and Galan , 1997 ; Fu and Galan , 1998 ) . 
Interestingly , one of these effector proteins , Salmonella invasion protein A ( SipA ) , is not only responsible for promoting actin polymerization , which facilitates bacterial entry into epithelial cells , but also plays a role in the induction of PMN migration across the intestinal epithelium ( Bourdet-Sicard and Tran Van Nhieu , 1999 ; Zhou et al. , 1999a ; Lee et al. , 2000 ) . 
Early reports describing a function for SipA found that this effector forms a complex with T-plastin and F-actin ( Zhou et al. , 1999b ; Galkin et al. , 2002 ) . 
As a result of this interaction , SipA increases 
Summary 
In human intestinal disease induced by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) transepithelial migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) rapidly follows attachment of the bacteria to the epithelial apical membrane . 
Previously , we have shown that the S. typhimurium effector protein , SipA , plays a pivotal role in signalling epithelial cell responses that lead to the transepithelial migration of PMNs . 
Thus , the objective of this study was to determine the functional domain of SipA that regulates this signalling event . 
SipA was divided into two fragments : the SipAb C-terminal fragment426-684 ( 259 AA ) , which binds actin , and the SipAa frag-ment2-425 ( 424 AA ) , which a role has yet to be described . 
In both in vitro and in vivo models of S. typhimurium-induced intestinal inﬂammation the SipAa fragment exhibited a profound ability to induce PMN transmigration , whereas the SipAb actin-binding domain failed to induce PMN transmigration . 
Subsequent mapping of the SipAa domain identiﬁed a 131-amino-acid region ( SipAa3294-424 ) responsible for modulating PMN tran-sepithelial migration . 
Interestingly , neither intracellular translocation nor actin association of SipA was necessary for its ability to induce PMN transepithelial migration . 
As these results indicate SipA has at least two separate functional domains , we speculate that during infection S. typhimurium requires delivery of

the actin-bundling activity of T-plastin suggesting that this effector protein enhances bacterial invasion by stabilizing actin ﬁlaments in S. typhimurium-induced membrane ruffles . 
More recently , it was shown that SipA acts as a molecular staple linking adjacent actin ﬁlaments together under the cell surface resulting in the formation of projections that surround and engulf Salmonella allowing its entry ( Higashide et al. , 2002 ) . 
This function of Salmonella was localized to a C-terminal fragment of the protein that consisted of two actin-binding arms around a central globular domain ( Higashide et al. , 2002 ; Lilic et al. , 2003 ) . 
In addition to its actin-binding role , we have also shown SipA to be both necessary and sufficient to initiate the cellular events that lead to PMN transepithelial migration during acute states of active intestinal inﬂammation ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Criss et al. , 2001 ; Silva et al. , 2004 ) . 
Interestingly , the interaction of SipA at the apical surface of intes-tinal epithelial cells is sufficient to initiate the cellular events that lead to such PMN transepithelial migration . 
To date , the molecular mechanism underlying these cellular events has revealed that SipA activates a novel ADP-ribosylation factor ( ARF ) 6 - and phospholipase D ( PLD ) - dependent lipid-signalling cascade ( Criss et al. , 2001 ) that in turn activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) - a ( Silva et al. , 2004 ) , which ultimately leads to the apical secretion of the potent PMN chemoattractant , hepoxilin A3 ( Mrsny et al. , 2004 ) . 
Neutrophil transit across the intestinal epi-thelium to the luminal surface is directed by this apically released eicosanoid as a result of a chemotactic gradient that is formed across the epithelial tight junctional complex . 
Furthermore , the central role that SipA plays in inducing epithelial responses resulting in the transepithelial migration of PMN has subsequently been validated in two distinct in vivo models of Salmonella-induced enteritis ( Zhang et al. , 2002 ; Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
The recognized bifunctional features of the S. typhimu-rium SipA effector protein have prompted us to consider whether one functional motif or distinct motifs of the SipA molecule account for each reported function . 
Prior truncation analysis of SipA has shown that the C-terminal fragment , termed SipAb426-684 , is responsible for the binding of SipA to the host cytoskeletal protein , actin ( Zhou et al. , 1999b ; Higashide et al. , 2002 ; Lilic et al. , 2003 ) . 
However , the function of the N-terminal domain of SipA , termed SipAa2-425 , has yet to be fully elucidated . 
To date , the only reported function of the N-terminal fragment has been its involvement in type III secretion with the binding of the chaperone , InvB ( between the ﬁrst 158 and 264 residues ) ( Bronstein et al. , 2000 ; Lilic et al. , 2006 ) . 
Collectively , these observations led us to hypothesize that the N-terminal SipAa2-425 fragment of the SipA effector protein harbours the functional domain for inducing the cellular events leading to Salmonella-elicited gastroenteritis . 
Consistent with our hypothesis , the results presented herein reveal that the S. typhimurium N-terminal ( SipAa2-425 ) domain , speciﬁcally a 131-amino-acid region we have termed SipAa3294-424 , plays an essential and direct role in activating the epithelial signalling pathways that promote PMN transepithelial migration . 
Thus , we speculate that during infection with S. typhimurium , SipA requires delivery to both extracellular ( SipAa2-425 ) and intracellular ( SipAb426-684 ) epithelial domains in order to optimally manipulate pro-inﬂammatory responses and subsequent mechanisms of bacterial invasion , both of which are fundamental aspects of its pathogenesis . 
Results
SipA and SipAa caused PMN transmigration whereas SipAb did not
In our model of SipA as a bifunctional molecule we suggest that this protein has at least two separate domains : one for interacting with actin , and one for its role in inﬂammation . 
It has previously been shown and we also noted the ability of the SipAb426-684 fragment to bind actin ( Fig. 1C ) , whereas the N-terminal fragment , SipAa2-425 , did not ( Lilic et al. , 2003 ) . 
We reasoned therefore that the functional motif responsible for eliciting the cellular events , which lead to PMN transepithelial migration , might be associated with the N-terminal SipAa2-425 fragment . 
To test this notion , SipA from S. typhimurium wild-type strain SL1344 was divided into individual SipAa2-425 and SipAb426-684 fragments ( Experimental procedures ) , and each fragment was expressed and secreted by Escheri-chia coli F-18 ( Fig. 1B ) , a commensal strain isolated from a healthy human ( Cohen et al. , 1983 ) . 
This E. coli strain has the ability to secrete proteins through its ﬂagellar basal body ( FBB ) , a structure on the cell surface which can secrete proteins in a similar fashion to a type III secretion system ( TTSS ) , but it can not translocate them to a host cell ( data not shown ) . 
Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that proteins were being secreted ( Fig. 1B ) and not released due to lysis of the bacterial cells ( data not shown ) . 
Initially , we chose to individually express S. typhimurium wild-type strain SL1344 SipA , and its SipAa2-425 and SipAb426-684 fragments in the E. coli F-18 commensal strain so that we could directly assess the ability of these fragments to drive PMN transepithelial migration in the absence of other S. typhimurium virulence determinants . 
As shown in Fig. 2A we found that the S. typhimurium SipAa2-425 fragment , which fails to bind actin , induced a vigorous PMN migration response resulting in nearly 30 % more PMN transepithelial migration as compared with monolayers stimulated with the full-length SipA protein . 
In contrast , the actin-binding , SipAb426-684 , fragment was dramatically reduced ( > 80 % ) in its capacity to induce PMN transepithelial migration as compared with the full-length SipA molecule . 
These results not only indicate that the SipAa2-425 fragment is the key functional domain that underlies the induction of epithelial responses that lead to PMN transepithelial migration but further suggest that distinct functional motifs of the SipA molecule account for the promotion of PMN transcellular signals ( SipAa2-425 ) and the binding to actin ( SipAb426-684 ) . 
As our data indicate that the SipAa2-425 fragment is involved in the activation of a signalling cascade that results in the directed movement of PMN across the intes-tinal epithelium , it was important to determine if this fragment could also induce the secretion of IL-8 . 
IL-8 is the prototypical pro-inﬂammatory chemokine and during active states of intestinal inﬂammation this PMN chemoattractant is released from the basolateral surface of intes-tinal epithelial cells where it guides PMN recruitment to the lamina propria and subepithelium but does not recruit PMNs across the intestinal epithelium ( McCormick et al. , 1993 ; 1995a , b ; Mrsny et al. , 2004 ; Kucharzik et al. , 2005 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 2B , exposure of the apical surface of polarized T84 cell monolayers with either E. coli F-18 strain expressing SipA , SipAa2-425 or SipAb426-684 only induced modest levels of IL-8 secretion ( < 150 pg ) as compared with wild-type S. typhimurium SL1344 and the phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) - positive control , both of which induced large amounts of basolateral IL-8 secretion ( 1600 pg and > 1150 pg respectively ) . 
These data indicate that the SipAa2-425 fragment , in the absence of other S. typhimurium virulence determinants , does not trigger a signal transduction pathway leading to the epithelial secretion of IL-8 . 
This result is not unexpected given the fact that the primary means by which epithelial cells activate IL-8 expression in response to S. typhimurium is by the activation of epithelial toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) via S. typhimurium ﬂagellin monomers ( Gewirtz et al. , 2001 ; Zeng et al. , 2003 ) . 
SipA and SipAa2-425 histopathology indicated severe inﬂammation
Given that the results from our in vitro model of intestinal inﬂammation suggest that the SipAa2-425 fragment of SipA is responsible for eliciting PMN transepithelial migration , we next sought to verify this observation in vivo by employing a murine model of Salmonella-induced enteritis ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
In these in vivo experiments we used a Salmonella dublin sipA mutant strain to express the S. typhimurium SL1344 SipAa2-425 and the SipAb426-684 fragments rather than using the SL1344 background strain as although the SipAa2-425 and SipAb426-684 fragments could be cloned in SL1344 , unlike S. dublin they were not secreted constitutively . 
The ability of S. dublin to constitutively produce proteins from the pBH plasmid was previously observed ( Cherayil et al. , 2000 ) and it allowed expression of the proteins of interest in animal infections without the need for induction by IPTG . 
Groups of ﬁve mice were streptomycin treated before oral administration of S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) expressing SipA , SipAa2-425 or SipAb426-684 along with a positive enteritis control ( S. typhimurium SL1344 ) and two negative controls [ S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) and physiologic buffer HBSS + ] . 
After 72 h of infection the mice were sacriﬁced and the caeca were grossly examined . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , it is evident that only the caeca from the mice infected with the S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) expressing either SL1344 SipA or SipAa2-425 exhibited an inﬂammatory phenotype remarkably similar to the SL1344-positive control . 
Such caeca appeared inﬂamed as demonstrated by their shrivelled and translucent/pale appearance and to the touch were hard and compressed as compared with the negative controls . 
In contrast , the caeca from the SipAb426-684-infected mice displayed gross morphological features that were consistent with the S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) and HBSS + - negative controls . 
For example , the SipAb426-684-infected caeca were of normal size , brown in appearance and did not display a rigid architecture . 
Thus , these results indicate that the greatest amount of inﬂammation occurred in mice infected with the full-length SipA and SipAa2-425-expressing bacteria , but not in mice infected with SipAb426-684-expressing bacteria . 
Next , the level of intes-tinal inﬂammation was quantiﬁed histologically in a blinded fashion by a trained pathologist ( Fig. 4A ) . 
Haemotoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining of the proximal colon revealed that mice infected with SL1344 and S. dublin A1 -- 2-425 ( SipA ) expressing SipA or SipAa exhibited inﬂamed colons with clear signs of oedema , PMN inﬁltration in the lamina propria , epithelial erosion and crypt elongation ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In contrast , and perhaps expected from the gross pathology results , no signs of pronounced inﬂammation were observed with the S. dublin A1 strain expressing 426-684 SipAb ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Each of the strains used in this mouse model of enteritis all colonized the caecum and large colon to the same extent so that the differences noted in the severity of intestinal pathology are not due to differences in bacterial tissue burden ( data not shown ) . 
Fluorescent staining using an antibody speciﬁc for a PMN surface marker ( reacts with a common epitope on Ly-6G and Ly-6C ) provided a more detailed picture as to the degree of the PMN inﬁltration induced by SL1344 , SipA and SipAa2-425 as compared with SipAb426-684 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In mice infected with the positive control strain SL1344 or S. dublin A1 expressing SipA , and SipAa2-425 , PMNs could be detected at the tips of the villi and often in large quantities in the lumen . 
However , in animals infected with S. dublin A1 expressing SipAb426-684 , PMNs were occasionally noted and the few that were present failed to congregate at the tips of villi . 
This observation is consistent with both negative controls . 
As a large amount of PMN inﬁltration was observed with S. dublin A1 expressing SipA and SipAa2-425 but not with S. dublin A1 SipAb426-684 , we quantiﬁed the level of inﬁltration by performing an ELISA for the PMN enzyme myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) ( Fig. 4B ) . 
As expected , S. dublin A1 expressing SipAb426-684 caused very little PMN inﬁltration into the proximal colon ( 161 ng per gram of tissue ) . 
Indeed , such levels of MPO activity were consistent with those exhibited by the HBSS + - infected negative control ( 207 ng per gram of tissue ) . 
The greatest levels of MPO activity were observed with SipAa2-425-expressing bacteria and these results mirrored what was seen in the PMN in vitro assays ( Fig. 2A ) , as the SipAa2-425 fragment ( 2543 ng per gram of tissue ) was more efficient at inducing PMN transmigration than either the full-length SipA protein ( 637 ng per gram of tissue ) or the SL1344 wild-type control ( 2097 ng per gram of tissue ) . 
These in vivo results therefore further substantiate the important role that SipA , and in particular SipAa2-425 , play in inducing epithelial cell responses that lead to PMN transepithelial migration . 
In fact , the truncated SipAa2-425 fragment appears much more efficient at inducing this response as compared with the full-length SipA molecule .

A. SipA from S. typhimurium SL1344 was divided into the N-terminal fragment ( SipAa2-425 ) and the C-terminal fragment ( SipAb426-684 ) and the respective fragments were cloned into the pBH HA-tag expression vector as described under Experimental procedures . 
The cloned fragments were then expressed in the commensal organism E. coli F-18 and used in the in vitro model of intestinal inﬂammation to study PMN recruitment .

E. coli F-18 , a non-pathogen isolated from the human colon , attaches to the apical surface but is non-invasive .

Negative controls consisted of the pBH empty vector control along with a buffer ( HBSS + ) control . 
In contrast to the negative controls , SipAa2-425 elicited > 130 % of the full-length SipA transmigration response , whereas the actin-binding fragment , SipAb426-684 , elicited < 10 % .

T84 intestinal monolayers were colonized with E. coli F-18 expressing full-length SipA , SipAa2-425 and SipAb426-684 and subsequently assessed for secretion of IL-8 via ELISA assay ( see Experimental procedures ) .

Shown here is the quantity of IL-8 secreted ( pg ml-1 ) into the basolateral aspect of T84 polarized monolayers . 
As we failed to detect IL-8 secretion from any of the SipA fragments , including SipA , itself , we conﬁrmed that polarized T84 monolayers could secrete IL-8 in response to wild-type S. typhimurium SL1344 . 
Data represent the mean and SD of triplicate samples .

Identiﬁcation of the SipAa2-425 fragment responsible for inducing PMN migration
* 
In order to map the region of SipA responsible for causing PMN migration the SipAa2-425 fragment was further divided into three smaller fragments : SipAa12-149 , SipAa2152-290 and SipAa3294-424 . 
Based on our earlier work we knew that SipA monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) could block the ability of S. typhimurium SipA to drive PMN transepithelial migration . 
Thus , we used this information as an initial screening strategy employing Western blot analysis to determine which of the SipAa2-425 truncation fragments could bind the SipA mAb . 
As shown in Fig. 5A we found that the SipA mAb only bound to the truncation region designated SipAa3294-424 . 
The possibility that the region responsible for induction of PMN migration is in the SipAa3294-424 fragment agrees with previous observations 2-425 that towards the N-terminal , SipAa contains the functional regions for chaperone binding and secretion ( Bronstein et al. , 2000 ; Lilic et al. , 2006 ) . 
2-425 Therefore , based on this information , SipAa was divided into two fragments termed SipAa122-290 and SipAa3294-424 and evaluated for their ability to induce tran-sepithelial migration of PMN in both in vitro and in vivo models . 
First , in vitro PMN transmigration assays revealed that the fragment bound by the SipA mAb , SipAa3294-424 , and not the SipAa122-290 fragment was responsible for PMN migration ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Levels of PMN migration induced by the SipAa3294-424 fragment were consistent with both wild-type strains ( S. typhimurium and S. dublin ) , and were ﬁve times higher than those induced by both the SipAa122-290 and S. dublin SipA -- strains .

Disease score of colonic inﬂammation is shown . 
The scores are assessed by determination of inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells ( range from 0 to 4 ) , together with the evaluation of colon tissue damage ( also a range of 0 -- 4 ) , with 0 scored normal and a score of 4 showing the most signiﬁcant level of disease pathology . 
The data shown are measurements of individual mice ( n = 6 -- 8 per group , 3 for PBS control ) pooled from three independent experiments . 
B. PMN inﬁltration into the proximal colon quantiﬁed by MPO . 
Tissue MPO was quantiﬁed in the proximal colon sections in mice after a 72 h infection with S. dublin SipA -- strains expressing either full-length SipA , SipAa2-425 or SipAb426-684 . 
The positive MPO control is shown for infection with wild-type S. typhimurium SL1344 , and the negative control represents oral gavage with only the buffer PBS . 
Data are expressed as the mean and SD and represent groups of four mice per each data set . 
Experiments were performed at least three times . 
* P < 0.01 when the data set for a given infection was compared with the amount of MPO in response to the negative PBS control ; NS , not signiﬁcantly different from MPO activity present in the negative control . 
These observations were further tested in the in vivo streptomycin mouse model where S. dublin strains expressing the various fragments were used . 
Again , based on results of the histopathological analysis as well as in the quantiﬁcation PMNs within the tissue ( Figs 6 and 7 ) , the SipAa3294-424-secreting S. dublin caused dramatically more intestinal inﬂammation . 
HE staining of the proximal colon sections also revealed inﬁltration of PMNs into both the submucosa and the mucosa of mice infected with the wild-type and SipAa3294-424-expressing S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) ( Fig. 6 ) . 
This was in contrast to the negative controls [ S. dublin A1 ( SipA -- ) and PBS ] and the S. dublin expressing SipAa122-290 . 
Fluorescent staining for PMN markers conﬁrmed the inﬂammation was more pronounced in both the wild-type and SipAa3294-424 strains ( Fig. 6 ) with large numbers of PMNs being seen in the crypt . 
Furthermore , the quantiﬁcation of tissue PMNs via MPO analysis was consistent with these ﬁndings as the SipAa3294-424 fragment ( 2392 ng per gram of MPO ) induced similar levels of tissue MPO as compared with wild-type S. dublin ( 2733 ng g-1 ) whereas the 
SipAa122-290 ( 438 ng g-1 ) results mirrored those of the SipA mutant strain ( 396 ng g-1 ; Fig. 7 ) . 
DsipB and DsipC mutants showed SipA did not need to be translocated to have an effect on PMN transepithelial migration 
Our previous results demonstrated that puriﬁed S. typhimurium SipA protein could trigger the PMN migration response in the absence of the type III secretion and translocation factors , such as SipB and SipC , suggesting that this effector may not need to be translocated into the cytosol to initiate the events that lead to PMN transepi-thelial migration ( Lee et al. , 2000 ) . 
To validate this observation we took a genetic approach to determine whether intracellular translocation or actin association of SipA is necessary for its ability to induce PMN transepithelial migration . 
Thus , two S. typhimurium non-polar deletion mutants , DsipB ( JD14 ) and DsipC ( JD15 ) , were constructed . 
These strains express native SipA from the chromosomal sipA locus and are capable of secreting effector proteins , but can not translocate them into the host cell cytosol ( Fig. 8A ) . 
Thus , without the SipB and SipC translocases , SPI-1 effector proteins are merely secreted into the extracellular milieu where they can come into contact with the extracellular environment of the host cell . 
The secretion proﬁle of SipA from the non-polar deletion strains , DsipB ( JD14 ) and DsipC ( JD15 ) , was quantiﬁed and the results conﬁrmed that both of these strains secrete identical amounts of SipA compared with the parent wild-type S. typhimurium strain ( SL1344 ) ( Fig. 8B ) . 
We next examined the abilities of both the DsipB ( JD14 ) and DsipC ( JD15 ) S. typhimurium strains to induce PMN transmigration . 
As shown in Fig. 8C , both DsipB ( JD14 ) and DsipC ( JD15 ) successfully induced PMN transepithelial migration > 80 % and 70 % , respectively , when compared with the E. coli F-18-negative control ( < 10 % ) . 
Although the response induced by the DsipC ( JD15 ) strain was slightly less than the response induced by the DsipB ( JD14 ) strain ( Fig. 8C ) , SipB and SipC have been shown to possess effector activities , which may affect the ability of SipA to stimulate PMN transmigration ( McGhie et al. , 2001 ) . 
Furthermore , the bacteria used in these assays were grown such that their ability to secrete SipA and induce PMN transmigration was dependent on the SPI-1 secretion system , not on the SPI-2 secretion system ( data not shown ; Bajaj et al. , 1996 ) . 
Thus , these observations provide important genetic-based evidence to further substantiate our contention that SipA does not need to be translocated into the epithelial cell cytosol to stimulate pro-inﬂammatory signal transduction pathways .

Discussion
To understand how the S. typhimurium effector protein SipA induces inﬂammatory responses in the intestinal mucosa , the SipA protein was divided into ( i ) the N-terminal fragment ( SipAa2-425 ) , the function of which , apart from containing the signal sequence and binding the chaperone , InvB , is largely unknown , and ( ii ) the C-terminal ( SipAb426-684 ) fragment , which has been shown to bind actin and facilitate bacterial entry . 
Our results demonstrate that the SipAa2-425 fragment , and more spe-ciﬁcally the SipAa3294-424 region , is the key functional domain that underlies the induction of epithelial responses that lead to PMN transepithelial migration , suggesting that distinct functional motifs of the SipA molecule account for the promotion of PMN transcellular signals ( SipAa2-425 ) and the binding to actin ( SipAb426-684 ) . 
In addition , we found that neither intracellular translocation nor actin association of SipA was necessary for its ability to induce PMN transepithelial migration . 
This observation is consistent with the fact that secretion of type III effector proteins in Salmonella occurs without coupled translocation ( Collazo and Galan , 1997 ) . 
Thus , we speculate that during infection with S. typhimurium , SipA requires deliv-2-425 ery to both extracellular ( SipAa ) and intracellular ( SipAb426-684 ) epithelial domains in order to optimally manipulate pro-inﬂammatory responses and subsequent mechanisms of bacterial invasion . 
Type III secretion systems play a central role in virulence , directing the secretion and translocation of several bacterial effector proteins into the host cytoplasm ( Hueck , 1998 ) . 
As SipA is a type III secreted protein it was surprising that extracellular SipA , and in particular the SipAa2-425 fragment , could induce PMN transmigration . 
Although this appears to deviate from the paradigm of the location of action of type III effectors , it should not be over-looked that original studies investigating Salmonella type III effectors reported that 80 -- 90 % of secreted effector proteins from Salmonella were found either associated with non-adherent bacteria or in the infection media , whereas only about 10 % were actually translocated into the host cell ( Collazo and Galan , 1997 ) . 
Consequently , our ﬁndings raise the interesting possibility that SipA may target two separate epithelial domains , as host cellular translocation was not necessary for SipA to cause inﬂammation . 
This notion is supported by evidence dem-onstrating that although two translocation mutants of SL1344 , DsipB and DsipC , could secrete but not deliver

SipA into the host cell , PMN transepithelial migration still occurred . 
Although we have previously shown that interaction of the SipA protein with the epithelial cells is sufficient to induce epithelial cell responses that elicit PMN transmigration , here we have taken a genetic approach to validate these earlier ﬁndings ( Lee et al. , 2000 ) . 
Therefore , on the balance of these observations we propose a model to suggest that during infection with S. typhimurium , SipA might exhibit a dual function requiring delivery to both extracellular ( SipAa2-425 ) and intracellular spaces ( SipAb426-684 ) based on how SipA is secreted from the bacteria ( Fig. 9 ) . 
For example , in this model the invasion ability of SipA would be mediated by the type III protein secretion and translocation system encoded by SPI-1 , whereas the PMN transmigration inducing ability of SipA would be independent of SPI-1 . 
Given the observation that SipA can be secreted through the FBB of S. typhimurium ( R.A. Murray and B.A. McCormick , unpubl . 
obs . ) 
it is possible that the secretion of SipA via the FBB system would not translocate SipA into the cytosol , and thus would not affect actin polymerization . 
This model would be consistent with the recent ﬁndings of Higashide and Zhou ( 2006 ) showing that the SopA effector protein is not translocated into host cells following the ﬂagellar export of SopA . 
Further investigation will be required to validate this model . 
The fact that SipA exhibits bifunctional activities is not without precedent as other type III secreted effectors can exhibit dual functions . 
For example , although the S. typhimurium translocases SipB and SipC play crucial roles in protein translocation , these secreted proteins also act as effector proteins once they enter the host cell . 
In particular , once SipB enters the host cell it activates the enzyme caspase-1 ( Collazo and Galan , 1997 ) while SipC possesses functional domains for translocation and actin nucleation ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Chang et al. , 2005 ) . 
Furthermore , the Pseudomonas aeruginosa effector proteins , ExoS and ExoT , are examples of bifunctional secreted effectors with two independent enzyme activities that exhibit two different functions interfacing with eukaryotic cells ; a Rho-Gap domain is encoded within the N-terminus and causes actin reorganization , while the C-terminus encodes the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain ( Sun and Barbieri , 2003 ) . 
Moreover , our results have further identiﬁed the functional motif of the SipAa2-425 domain responsible for eliciting the cellular events leading to PMN transepithelial migration , and this has not been previously recognized . 
PMN transmigration assays and infections using the streptomycin mouse model both detected the SipAa3294-424 fragment of SipA as being responsible for induction of PMN transmigration and subsequent inﬂammation . 
This result is consistent with previous observations that the N-terminal section of SipA , SipAa122-290 , contains the signal sequence for secretion and also the region bound by the SipA chaperone protein InvB ( Bronstein et al. , 2000 ; Lilic et al. , 2006 ) . 
Furthermore , the SipAa2-425 fragment was also found to cause more inﬂammation in the in vivo model of Salmonella-induced enteritis when compared with the full-length SipA protein . 
One explanation that may account for this observation is that the parent SipA protein ( 87 kDa ) breaks down to a prominent 51 kDa degradation product ( Hueck et al. , 1995 ) , which harbours the SipAa2-425 domain ( D.M. Wall and B.A. McCormick , unpubl . 
obs . ) . 
Thus , this smaller fragment may be in a conformation that potentially makes the interaction of the SipAa2-425 domain with the cell surface more efficient and correlates with the increased intestinal inﬂammation . 
It was also noted that the efficiency of this interaction was more pronounced in the mouse infection model but this is most likely do to saturating concentrations of proteins achieved under in vitro conditions . 
Thus , while the SipAa2-425 fragment is observed to be more efficient in causing inﬂammation in vivo this effect is probably masked in vitro by the high concentration of protein being secreted by the bacteria as PMN migration proceeds at its maximum level . 
These hypotheses remain to be tested . 
Based on these observations , however , it is tempting to speculate that the SipAa2-425 fragment interacts with a receptor on the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium . 
Strengthening this speculation , in part , is our ﬁnding that SipA localizes to the membrane insoluble fraction following apical exposure to either SipA episomally expressed in E. coli F-18 or puriﬁed SipA ( W.J. Nadeau and B.A. McCormick , unpubl . 
data ) . 
Indeed , other bacterial effector proteins have been shown to affect signal transduction pathways by acting at the cell membrane . 
As an example , YpkA , a Yersinia-secreted Yop effector , localizes to the inner surface of the eukaryotic cell membrane , where it is thought to interfere with a signal transduction pathway ( Cornelis and Wolf-Watz , 1997 ) . 
However , in contrast to our ﬁndings with SipA , extensive studies conﬁrm that puri-ﬁed Yops do not modulate biological activity if added directly to eukaryotic cells , although they are capable of inducing cytoxicity if artiﬁcially introduced into these cells ( Cornelis and Wolf-Watz , 1997 ) . 
Comparisons between SipA and the Shigella ﬂexneri-secreted protein IpaA also emphasize the unique properties of SipA . 
IpaA shares approximately 20 % homology with S. typhimurium SipA . 
Although IpaA has also been found to affect actin polymerization , it appears to do so by rapidly associating with vinculin , a protein involved in linking actin ﬁlaments to the plasma membrane . 
In addition , ipaA mutants do not exhibit the same phenotype as sipA mutants in our inﬂammatory model system as we found that ipaA mutants are capable of inducing PMN transmigration as efficiently as wild-type S. ﬂexneri ( A.T. Maurelli and B.A. McCormick , unpubl . 
obs . ) . 
Of course , it is also possible SipAa2-425 may be able to bind and cross the epithelial cell membrane , entering the host cell cytosol by a process that does not require the type III translocation system . 
In the cytosol , SipA may interact with one or more host cell components to stimulate ARF-6 , which ultimately leads to the production of hepoxilin A3 as well as alter the actin cytoskeleton . 
In summary , this work further underscores the important role of the effector protein SipA as a coordinator of an immune inﬂammatory response resulting in PMN inﬂux . 
By identifying the functional domain of SipAa ( SipAa3294-424 ) that triggers host transcellular signals leading to the directed movement PMN across the intes-tinal mucosa , we can start to pinpoint a potential target for therapeutic intervention of this inﬂammatory disease and perhaps of other diseases at mucosal surfaces ( e.g.

Experimental procedures
Tissue culture
T84 intestinal epithelial cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) ( Passages 50 -- 70 ) were grown in a mixture of Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagles medium and Ham 's F12 Nutrient mixture supplemented with 14 mM NaHCO3 , 15 mM Hepes buffer ( pH 7.5 ) , 40 mg l-1 penicillin , 8 mg l-1 ampicillin , 90 mg l-1 streptomycin and 5 % fetal bovine serum . 
T84 cell monolayers were grown and maintained on inverted 0.33 cm2 ring-supported , collagen-coated polycarbonate ﬁlters ( cell culture inserts ) ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) as previously described ( Dharmsathaphorn and Madara , 1990 ) with modiﬁcations ( Madara et al. , 1992 ) . 
Steady-state transepithelial resistance ( TER ) was measured using Millipore Millicell-TERS with ` chopstick ' electrodes ( World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL ) . 
A conﬂuent monolayer corresponded to 400 -- 1500 cells cm-2 , consistent with measurements by Dharmsathaphorn and Madara ( 1990 ) . 
Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
Salmonella and E. coli strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
All S. typhimurium strains are derivatives of SL1344 , a wild-type strain that is invasive in T84 cells . 
F-18 is a normal human faecal isolate of E. coli , which is non-invasive and avirulent but has the ability to secrete proteins through its FBB . 
All bacterial strains were constructed ( Murray and Lee , 2000 ) and cultured in LB as previously described ( Lee and Falkow , 1990 ) . 
Strains carrying pBH ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) or its derivatives -1 were cultured in media containing 50 mg ml ampicillin and protein expression was induced where appropriate with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . 
These growth conditions preferentially induce the expression of the SPI-1 TTSS and repress expression of the SPI-2 system ( Bajaj et al. , 1996 ) . 
Construction of DsipB and DsipC strains
Non-polar mutant deletions in sipB and sipC designed to delete the codons for amino acids 1 -- 351 and 1 -- 251 of sipB and sipC , respectively , were constructed by the PCR-ligation-PCR method ( Ali and Steinkasserer , 1995 ) and were cloned into the temperature-sensitive suicide vector , pMAK705 ( Hamilton et al. , 1989 ) , generating pMAK-sipB and pMAK-sipC . 
Oligonucleotides used to construct pMAK-sipB ( 5 ′ - TTTTCTAGAAGTCGTT AAGTTCTACAAAGT-3 ′ , 5 ′ - TTTAAGCTTAATTATTCCTTTTCTT GTTCA-3 ′ , 5 ′ - TTTAAGCTTGTGGCCGATGAAATTGTGAAG-3 ′ and 5 ′ - TTTGGTACCATTTTTCTCCCTTTATTTTGG-3 ′ ) and pMAK-sipC ( 5 ′ - TTTAAGCTTGTGGCCGATGAAATTGTGAAG-3 ′ , 5 ′ - TTTGGTACCATTTTTCTCCCTTTATTTTGG-3 ′ , 5 ′ - ACCG GTACCGATGCGACGAAAAAT-3 ′ and 5 ′ - TTTGGATCCATATC CCCAGTTCGCCATCAG-3 ′ ) were obtained from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . 
A 1.3 kb XbaI -- KpnI fragment carrying the deletion in sipB was inserted into the XbaI -- KpnI-digested pMAK705 generating plasmid pMAK-sipB . 
A 1.3 kb HindIII -- BamHI fragment carrying the deletion in sipC was inserted into the BamHI -- HindIII-digested pMAK705 generating pMAK-sipC . 
These plasmids were introduced into S. typhimurium strain SL1344 by electroporation , and recipient bacteria that had integrated the plasmids into the chromosome by homologous recombination were selected for by their resistance to chloramphenicol at 42 °C . 
After passage under non-selective conditions , clones that had resolved the co-integrate by excision of the vector sequences were selected for by their sensitivity to chloramphenicol . 
Chloramphenicol-sensitive resolvants were screened for the correct deletion by PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion . 
S. typhimurium strain JD14 contained the correct deletion in sipB . 
S. typhimurium strain JD15 contained the correct deletion in sipC . 
Construction of plasmids
The vector pBH ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) was used to clone and add a haemaglutinin ( HA ) tag to SipA and the truncated SipA fragments SipAa2-425 , SipAb426-684 , SipAa12-149 , SipAa2132-290 , SipAa122-290 and SipAa3294-424 . 
Genomic DNA from S. typhimu-rium SL1344 was used as a template in PCR reactions . 
Forward primers were designed with a HindIII site and reverse primers with an EcoRI site for cloning in frame into the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) of pBH . 
Whole sipA was ampliﬁed using HindIIISipA2 ( 5 ′ - GATATTAAGCTTAGTTACAAGTGTAA GGACTC-3 ′ ) and SipAEcoRI ( 5 ′ - GCTTGCACATGCAGCGG AATTCGC-3 ′ ) primers . 
The sipAa2-425 ( 1 -- 1275 bp ) fragment was ampliﬁed using the HindIIISipA2 and 1275EcoRI ( 5 ′ - GG TTGGAATTCCCGTAGTGCCCTTTTCTG-3 ′ ) primers . 
The sipAb426-684 ( 1276-2052 bp ) fragment was ampliﬁed using the 1275HindIII ( 5 ′ - AGGGCAAAGCTTGTGAAACAACCTCTT-3 ′ ) and SipAEcoRI primers . 
The sipAa12-149 ( 1 -- 447 bp ) was ampliﬁed using the HindIIISipA2 and SipAa1EcoRI ( 5 ′ - TCCA GCGAATTCTCCGCTTTCTTTGTTTCTGGC-3 ′ ) primers . 
The sipAa2152-290 ( 453 -- 870 bp ) was ampliﬁed using the SipAa2HindIII ( 5 ′ - GCGGAAAGCTTGCTGGAAAACCTGGAA-3 ′ ) and SipAa2EcoRI primers . 
The sipAa122-290 ( 4 -- 870 bp ) fragment was ampliﬁed using the HindIIISipA2 and SipAa2EcoRI ( 5 ′ - TTAATATTGGAATTCATACCCGTAGGTTCTGCTT-3 ′ ) primers . 
The sipAa3294-424 ( 882 -- 1272 bp ) was ampliﬁed using the SipAa3HindIII ( 5 ′ - CAGAACCTACGGGTATAAGCTTCAATATTAA TAT-3 ′ ) and SipAa3EcoRI ( 5 ′ - CAAAAGAGGTTGAATTCCC CGTAGTGCCCTT-3 ′ ) primers . 
Cloning of the sipA , sipAa2-425 , sipAb426-684 , sipAa122-290 and sipAa3294-424 fragments into pBH yielded the plasmids pSipA , pSipAa , pSipAb , pSipAa12 and pSipAa3 respectively . 
Clones were transformed into E. coli DH5a to ensure expression of the truncated proteins before being transformed into E. coli F-18 ( Fig. 1 ) for use in infection studies ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . 
Clones were introduced into Salmonella by electroporation ( O'Callaghan and Charbit , 1990 ) . 
Expression of SipA fragments and preparation of extracellular proteins
Approximately 30 ml of bacteria was grown overnight according to standard conditions . 
Protein production in E. coli F-18 was induced by addition of IPTG and the culture grown with shaking for 4 h . 
The bacterial culture was pelleted and the supernatant was ﬁltered through an Acrodisc 0.2 mm syringe ﬁlter ( Pall Gelman Laboratory , Ann Arbor , MI ) . 
Proteins were precipitated with 15 % trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h , collected via centrifugation at 15 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C , and washed with 100 % acetone . 
After centrifugation for a further 5 min at 15 000 r.p.m. , the pellet was dried for 5 min at room temperature and dissolved in SDS sample buffer and used immediately or stored at -80 °C for later use . 
SipAb-Actin co-sedimentation assay
Co-sedimentation assays were performed according to the method of Lilic et al. ( 2003 ) . 
Brieﬂy , assays were performed by mixing 20 mg of rabbit muscle G-actin ( Sigma ) and 50 mg of E. coli lysate containing overexpressed HA-tagged SipAb ; these were incubated for 8 h at 4 °C . 
Samples were centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4 °C and supernatants and pellets were analysed by SDS-PAGE . 
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Samples were separated through an 8 -- 16 % gradient Tris-HCl Ready Gel ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) by polyacrylamide electro-phoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and transferred to nitrocellulose . 
Immuno-blots were performed using a 1:5000 dilution of murine anti-HA mAb ( Covance , Richmond , CA ) . 
Goat anti-mouse IgG labelled with horseradish peroxidase ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) diluted 1:2000 was used to detect the bands , which were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Super Signal ECL kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . 
Samples were also electrophoresed on separate gels and Coomassie was stained to conﬁrm equal protein loading between samples .

PMN transepithelial migration assay
The physiologically directed ( basolateral to apical ) PMN transepi-thelial migration in response to bacterial stimulus has been previously described in detail ( McCormick et al. , 1993 ) . 
Brieﬂy , human peripheral PMNs were isolated from anticoagulated human whole blood by a gelatin sedimentation technique as previously described ( Parkos et al. , 1991 ) . 
T84 cells were stimulated at the apical surface with S. typhimurium , S. dublin or E. coli F-18 at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 375 for 1 h. Formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , a neutrophil chemoattractant , was used as a positive control in all assays . 
Following extensive washing , neutrophils ( 1 ¥ 106 ) were added to the basolateral surface and allowed to transmigrate through the monolayer for 2 h. PMN transmigration was quantiﬁed by assaying for the PMN-speciﬁc azurophilic granule marker MPO as previously described ( Parkos et al. , 1991 ) . 
PMN cell equivalents were estimated from daily PMN standards as the number of PMN that had completely traversed the monolayer into the apical chamber . 
The use of human volunteers in this study was in accordance with appropriate guidelines and was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital 's Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects ( approval # 977392 ) . 
IL-8 secretion assay
Transwells coated with T84 cells in the inverted fashion were washed with HBSS + and left for 20 min at 37 °C . 
Transwells were inverted in a moist chamber at 37 °C and infected with bacteria at an moi of 350 . 
The positive control was incubated with 1 mg ml-1 PMA in HBSS + . 
Incubation was carried out for 1 h after which all transwells were washed three times in warm HBSS + . 
Wells were then placed in a new plate and incubated in HBSS + for 5 h . 
One hundred microlitres from top reservoir ( basolateral ) was removed and IL-8 secretion was measured using the Human IL-8 Elisa Kit ( Pierce Endogen , Rockford , IL ) . 
Mice infections
Six - to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were infected using a modiﬁed version of the streptomycin pre-treatment model ( Barthel et al. , 2003 ) . 
Water and food were withdrawn 4 h prior to treatment with 3.75 mg of streptomycin intragastrically . 
The following day , water and food were again withdrawn for 4 h before the mice were infected with 5 ¥ 107 colony-forming units ( cfu ) of S. typhimurium SL1344 or S. dublin ( 500 ml of a suspension in PBS intragastrically by gavage ) . 
S. dublin were not induced with IPTG as S. dublin produced the proteins constitutively . 
Mice were left for 72 h before sacriﬁce and removal of the colon and caecum for examination . 
Histological procedures
Proximal colon samples were placed in optimal cutting temperature compound ( OCT ) ( Sakura , Torrance , CA ) and snap was frozen in liquid nitrogen . 
Cryosections ( 5 mm ) were mounted on glass slides before either HE or ﬂuorescent staining . 
HE staining was carried out according to the method of Chang et al. ( 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , ﬂuorescent staining was carried as follows . 
Slides were ﬁxed in acetone on ice for 10 min before submerging in a 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution . 
Slides were blocked by adding ﬁrst an avidin solution in 1 % BSA for 15 min , washing , and then biotin in 1 % BSA for a further 15 min ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . 
Sections were stained using a ﬂuorescein-iso-thiocyanate ( FITC ) - labelled anti-mouse Ly-6G and Ly-6C ( Gr-1 ) antibody ( BD Biosciences Pharmingen , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) for neutrophils for 90 min . 
After washing , DNA was stained and mounted using the 4 ′ 6 ′ - diamidino-2-phenylindol ( DAPI ) containing solution Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . 
Myeloperoxidase assay
Myeloperoxidase activity was measured using the Mouse MPO Elisa test kit from Cell Sciences ( Canton , MA ) . 
Brieﬂy , sections were taken from the proximal colon and snap was frozen in liquid nitrogen until testing . 
Upon thawing sections were weighed and then homogenized in lysis buffer as speciﬁed by the manufacturer . 
ELISA was carried out as per manufacturer 's instructions and the amount of MPO per section was expressed as nanogram of MPO per gram of tissue . 
Statistics
Neutrophil isolation was limited to repetitive donations by ﬁve different donors over the course of these experiments . 
Due to variations in both neutrophils and transepithelial resistance between monolayers ( baseline resistance between 400 and 2 1500 W cm ) , data were analysed within an individual experiment and not between experiments . 
However , the overall trends associated with these data are reproducible between experiments . 
All results are expressed as the mean standard deviation of an individual experiment performed in triplicate . 
P-values were calculated according to Student 's t-test , and values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant .
