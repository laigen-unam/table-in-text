Abstract 
A live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium vaccine candidate , LVR01 , was constructed by introducing a null deletion into the aroC gene of the parental canine S. typhimurium isolate , P228067 . 
LVR01 was used to orally deliver to the canine immune system a fatty acid binding protein ( FABP ) from Echinococcus granulosus ( EgDf1 ) , as a fusion protein with fragment C ( TetC ) of tetanus toxin . 
Immunization studies demonstrated that live LVR01 is well tolerated by orally vaccinated dogs . 
There was no detectable shedding of the vaccine strain in the faeces 2 days after immunization . 
Humoral antibody responses were observed 
against Salmonella , TetC and EgDf1 . 
Cellular responses were consistently detected against Salmonella and TetC . 
A cellular response against EgDf1 was also seen in a proportion of the LVR01 vaccinated dogs . 
We propose S. typhimurium LVR01 as a carrier for recombinant antigens and a vector for the construction of multivalent oral vaccines for dogs .

1. Introduction
Live , attenuated Salmonella have been proposed as vectors for the delivery of heterologous antigens to the mammalian immune system because of their potent immunogenicity and ability to deliver antigens via mucosal surfaces [ 1,2 ] . 
Signi ® cantly , most work on Sal-monella vectors has focused on laboratory animals , particularly mice , and relatively little is known about their behavior in humans or veterinary species . 
In humans , several attenuated Salmonella typhi derivatives are currently under evaluation as live oral typhoid vaccines [ 3 ± 12 ] . 
Some of these derivatives have been analyzed in volunteers as vectors for heter-ologous antigens , including hepatitis B core antigen 
either low or undetectable .

[ 13 ] , circumsporozoite surface antigen from Plasmo-dium falciparum [ 14 ] , and foreign lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) [ 10,15 ] . 
However , the immune responses to the carried foreign antigens reported to date have been 
Limited studies using dierent S. enterica serovar
vectors have been undertaken in cattle . 
Cattle orally or subcutaneously immunized with a S. typhimurium aro vaccine expressing fragment C of tetanus toxin ( TetC ) did not develop signi ® cant anti-TetC systemic antibodies or T cell responses [ 16 ] . 
In a separate report S. typhimurium aroA was used to deliver the antigens Tams1-1 and Tams1-2 from Theileria annulata to cattle . 
Two out of three animals , inoculated twice subcutaneously , but none of the three orally inoculated with the vaccine , elicited antibodies to the T. annulata antigens [ 17 ] . 
An S. dublin aroA strain was used to deliver the p67 of Theileria parva , and although antibodies to p67 were detected , the cattle had to be immunized several times [ 18 ] . 
Vaccines derived from host-adapted or host-virulent Salmonella could form the basis of more immunogenic vaccines in speci ® c veterinary hosts [ 18 ± 21 ] . 
For example , out of several attenuated S. typhimurium strains evaluated as salmonella vaccines in calves , only one , derived from a calf-virulent isolate , was e $ ective suggesting that selection of the Salmonella isolate on which to base the vaccine strain may be critical [ 20 ] . 
A Salmonella delivery system suitable for use in dogs could be useful as these animals are an important source of zoonotic infectious agents such as Echinococcus granulosus , the cause of hydatid disease in man . 
E. granulosus requires two mammalian hosts for lifecycle completion . 
The parasite initially develops in the gut of dogs into adult tapeworms . 
A wide variety of herbivorous and omnivorous animals can act as intermediate hosts , becoming infected via contact with eggs in canine faeces . 
Following entry into the intermediate host , the released oncospheres develop into hydatid cysts containing larval worms or protoscoleces that are ingested by dogs to close the cycle [ 22 ] . 
Although humans are an accidental host of this parasite , usually becoming infected through contact with infected dogs , in endemic areas the disease can be a signi ® cant public health problem [ 22 ] . 
Abdominal ecography studies have detected in some areas of Uruguay , infection rates in humans of up to 5 % of the total population [ 23 ] . 
Vaccination of dogs would be a cost-e $ ective measure to control hydatid disease , since it would break the cycle of transmission and avoid the production of infectious eggs . 
Attempts to vaccinate dogs with various protoscoleces-derived immunogens have met with limited success [ 24 ] . 
Salmonella vaccines could provide a potential route to the development of an E. granulosus vaccine for use in dogs , since they could target both mucosal and systemic immunity . 
Surveys have shown that isolation of salmonellae from dogs is not uncommon , with over 20 % of animals in a population being infected . 
Infection is usually asymptomatic , but severe fatal disease may also occur [ 25 ] . 
S. typhimurium is among the most frequently isolated , but other serotypes are also found [ 26 ] . 
Here , we describe a system for the rapid construction of attenuated aro mutant-derivatives of a dog-isolated S. typhi-murium and demonstrate the use of one derivative to deliver heterologous antigens from E. granulosus to the immune system of dogs . 
The antigen selected for study was EgDF1 , a cloned fatty acid binding protein from E. granulosus [ 27 ] . 
Fatty acid binding proteins from other worms have been found to be protective in experimental models and are candidate vaccine antigens [ 28 ] . 
We have previously shown that EgDF1 is immunogenic for mice when delivered by a live attenuated salmonella vaccine [ 29 ] ; this paper describes the development of this system for dogs , the target species .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids
Escherichia coli BRD049 is an aroC mutant [ 4 ] . 
SY327 and SY327 ( pGP704 ) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Mekalanos , Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , Harvard Medical School [ 30 ] . 
E. coli SY327 ( l pir ) expresses the Pir protein required for replication of the R6K origin and was used to maintain the suicide plasmid pGP704 . 
S. typhimurium P228067 was isolated from a dog and was obtained from the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens , at the Central Public Health Laboratory , London , UK . 
pTECH ± EgDf1 is a recombinant plasmid that drives the expression from the nir promoter of a fusion of TetC with the E. granulosus antigen EgDf1 [ 29 ] . 
Cosmid pTMC164 , encoding the aroC gene of S. typhi , was provided by Derek Pickard , Imperial College , London , UK . 
E. coli and S. typhimurium strains were routinely grown in LB broth or in LB agar [ 31 ] , supplemented with 50 mg/ml ampicillin as required . 
Minimal medium ( MM ) was prepared as described [ 31 ] and for MM agar , 2 % of noble agar ( Difco , Detroit ) was added . 
When required , media was supplemented with phenyl-alanine , tryptophan and tyrosine at a ® nal concentration of 40 mg/ml , and p-aminobenzoic acid and 2,3-dihydroxibenzoic acid at a ® nal concentration of 10 mg/ml ( aro mix ) . 
Bacteria to be used for immunization were grown statically overnight in LB broth , washed once in PBS and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 1010 bacteria/ml . 
The number of viable bacteria in the inoculum was evaluated by dilution counting on Tryptic Soy agar as previously described [ 32 ] . 
2.2. Molecular techniques
Puri ® cation of chromosomal and plasmid DNA , Southern blotting , enzyme incubations and electro-phoration of competent cells , were performed as described [ 31 ] . 
DNA probes were labeled using a Random Primed DNA labeling Kit ( Boehringer Mannheim BCL , Lewes , UK ) . 
Two sets of primers were used to facilitate the construction of aroC deletions in S. typhi-murium . 
One pair of primers , SK forward ( 5 ' - CAC-GACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3 ' ) and SK reverse ( 5 ' - CACACAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-CATG-3 ' ) correspond to regions ¯ anking the multiple cloning site of pBluescript SK . 
The other pair 
DaroC81 ( 5 ' - AATTCTAGACCTAGGAA-TACTGGTGCCGGTCGTCACGCC-3 ' ) and DaroC282 ( 5 ' - AATTCTAGACCTAGGAGTGGG-CAACACATTGTGGCGC-3 ' ) , were based on the sequence of aroC from S. typhi [ 33 ] , and correspond to regions within the S. typhimurium aroC that are 600 bp apart . 
Primers DaroC81 and DaroC282 were tailored at their 5 ' - end with restriction sites for XbaI and BlnI , and were used in conjunction with SK forward and SK reverse , respectively . 
PCR for screening of colonies for mutated aroC genes was conducted using forward ( 5 ' - ATGTTGACCGAAAGCGC-3 ' ) and reverse ( 5 ' - GCGCGAATCCCCACACA - 3 ' ) primers . 
2.3. Construction of S. typhimurium LVR01
Genomic DNA from S. typhimurium strain P228067 was prepared as described [ 31 ] . 
A 5.8 kb ( HindIII ) DNA fragment encoding the complete aroC gene of S. typhimurium P228067 was identi ® ed by Southern blotting using an aroC encoding DNA probe prepared from cosmid pTMC164 . 
The DNA fragment encoding the S. typhimurium aroC was selected using complementation of the aroC mutation of E. coli BRD049 . 
Two DNA primers based on the published Salmonella aroC gene were designed to facilitate the introduction of a 600 bp deletion into the aroC open reading frame . 
In a ® rst PCR , a DNA fragment was obtained that corresponded to the sequence from primer SK forward to the codon coding for amino acid 81 of aroC . 
This PCR product was cleaved with SalI and XbaI and ligated into pUC18 previously digested with the same two enzymes to obtain plasmid pUCaroC81 . 
A second PCR product , corresponding to the sequence from codon 282 of aroC to primer SK reverse , was cleaved with XbaI and EcoRI and cloned into pUCaroC81 cleaved with XbaI/EcoRI to obtain plasmid pUCDaroC . 
This 5.2 kb DNA fragment was cleaved from pUCDaroC with SalI and EcoRI , puri ® ed and ligated into the pGP704 suicide plasmid to obtain plasmid pLVRty . 
pLVRty was electroporated into P228067 and several colonies were recovered from LB agar plates containing ampicillin . 
Bacteria from these colo-nies were propagated overnight in broth supplemented with aromatic compounds but lacking ampicillin and several thousand colonies were screened for loss of ampicillin resistance , potentially associated with a second recombination event in which the wild type aroC gene is replaced by the mutant aroC gene . 
Colonies that had lost their ampicillin resistance were assessed for their ability to grow in minimal medium and the presence of the mutated aroC gene was con ® rmed by performing a PCR on whole bacterial cells . 
One of these mutated bacteria , which was ampicillin sensitive and dependent on aromatic compounds for growth , was named LVR01 and selected for further work . 
2.4. Animals and immunization protocols
Dogs were purchased from local breeders in Uru-guay at 3 months of age and kept in approved facilities for 3 months before being used . 
For each experiment , littermates of unspeci ® ed lineage weighing approximately 7 kg were used . 
Similar dogs were used in both experiments . 
For oral immunization , dogs were denied feed for 12 h before being allowed to drink 5 1010 bacteria in 2 ml of PBS , or PBS alone , and followed for at least 10 days after immunization , for symptoms of enteritis or bacterial shedding in faeces . 
Dogs were inspected daily . 
Rectal temperature was taken once a day . 
Faeces were inspected for signs of diarrhoea . 
Samples of faeces were cultured daily for the presence of salmonellae by standard techniques ( SS agar followed by biochemical analysis of suspicious colonies con ® rmed by slide agglutination ) , and if salmonellae were isolated , colony PCR of the aroC gene was performed in order to con ® rm the identity of the vaccine strain . 
Bacterial shedding was monitored in the ® rst experiment only . 
Dogs were bled weekly after immunization and sera were stored individually at ÿ208C . 
All work with dogs was conducted following international guidelines for use of animals for experimentation . 
2.5. Measurement of antibody responses
Antibody responses against TetC , EgDf1 and LPS were assessed in sera or saliva by ELISA as described [ 29 ] . 
Brie ¯ y , 96 well microtiter plates ( Nunc , Maxi-sorp ) were coated overnight at 48C with 0.1 mg/well of TetC ( Boehringer Mannheim , Lewes , Sussex , UK ) , 2 mg/well of recombinant EgDf1 ( rEgDf1 ) diluted in 0.1 M carbonate bu $ er pH 9.6 , or 0.2 mg/well of S. typhi-murium lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Sigma , Swanage , UK ) diluted in Reggiardo 's bu $ er . 
The cloning , production and puri ® cation of recombinant EgDf1 has been previously described [ 29 ] . 
Individual sera or saliva was diluted in PBS-1 % BSA , added to the wells and incubated for 90 min , at 378C . 
Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies speci ® c to dog immunoglobulins IgG , IgG1 , IgG2 , or IgA ( Bethyl Laboratories Inc. , Montgomery , USA ) were added at appropiate dilutions and the plates incubated for 1 h at 378C . 
Plates were developed with orthophenylene diamine ( OPD , Sigma ) prepared as per the manufacturer 's instructions for 15 min at 378C and the reaction stopped with 2 M H2SO4 before readings were taken at 490 nm . 
For antibody titration , serial two-fold dilutions of the sera were assessed by ELISA as above . 
Titers were expressed as the inverse of the maximal dilution giving a three-fold higher absorbance than that of the pre-immune sera for each dog 
Proliferative responses were assessed in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated with di $ erent antigens . 
For preparation of PBMC , blood samples were collected into heparin , centrifuged and the bu $ y coat collected , diluted in medium and overlayed on Histopaque 1077 ( Sigma ) . 
Samples were centrifuged and the interface with the PBMC harvested , and diluted into RPMI 1640 ( Sigma , Hepes modi ® cation ) . 
Cells were then washed twice before being resuspended in complete RPMI ( CRPMI : RPMI 1640 with 10 % heat inactivated new born calf serum ( NBCS ) , 0.1 % of 0.05 M 2-mercaptoethanol , 2 % 0.2 M glutamine , 10 mg/ml streptomycin , 100 U/ml penicillin ) and counted . 
Cell cultures were set up in round bottomed 96 well plates ( Corning , NY , USA ) at 5 105 cells/culture in 200 ml , and antigens or concanava-lin A were added in triplicate in volumes ranging between 5 ± 20 ml . 
Cultures were incubated at 378C in 95 % humidity , 5 % CO . 
After 6 days in culture 1 mCi 2 of 3H ] thymidine was added to each well and the plates were incubated for a further 18 h before being harvested on ® lters and incorporation of radioactive label determined . 
Values are expressed as the mean of the stimulation index obtained for each of the triplicates ( value of a speci ® c antigen divided by mean value of the three negative control ) and the standard deviation . 
2.7. Antigens used for T cell assays
TetC and rEgDf1 antigens were the same as those used for antibody determinations and used diluted in RPMI at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg per culture , respectively . 
For salmonella antigens a detoxi ® ed whole cell extract designated C5NaOH was prepared as described [ 34 ] . 
Brie ¯ y , a 50 ml overnight , stationary culture of S. typhimurium C5 was harvested by centrifugation , washed , resuspended in a small volume of PBS , and disrupted by sonication . 
The suspension was then clari ® ed by centrifugation , ® ltered through a 0.22 mm membrane and the protein concentration determined using the BCA method [ Pierce , IL , USA ] . 
Detoxi ® cation of the extract was carried out by addition of NaOH to a ® nal concentration of 0.25 M and incubated at 378C for 3 h , before neutralization with HCl . 
The extract was ® ltered through a 0.22 mm membrane and stored at ÿ208C . 
For in vitro stimulation , C5NaOH was used and diluted in RPMI at concentrations of 12 mg per culture .

Proliferation assays 
3.1. Construction of S. typhimurium aroC LVR01(pTECH±EgDf1) expressing E. granulosus antigen EgDf1
S. typhimurium P228067 was originally isolated from a dog . 
A deletion was introduced into the S. typhimur-ium P228067 aroC gene as described in Section 2 . 
This resultant strain , LVR01 , was ampicillin sensitive but dependent for growth on aromatic compounds . 
pTECH ± EgDf1 is a plasmid capable of driving the expression of a TetC ± EgDf1 fusion protein in S. typhi-murium vaccine strains from the nirB promoter [ 29 ] . 
S. typhimurium SL3261 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) is immunogenic in mice , inducing potent anti-EgDf1 and anti-TetC responses following oral immunization [ 29 ] . 
pTECH ± EgDf1 was transferred to LVR01 to obtain the recombinant S. typhimurium strain LVR01 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) . 
Western blot analysis of bacterial lysates showed that the TetC-fusion protein was expressed in LVR01 at a level similar to those detected in SL3261 ( result not shown ) . 
3.2. Oral immunization of dogs with S. typhimurium aroC LVR01(pTECH±EgDf1)
Six month old dogs were allowed to drink 5 1010 bacteria in 2 ml of PBS , or PBS alone , and followed daily for symptoms of enteritis or bacterial shedding in faeces . 
All dogs immunized with LVR01 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) tolerated the vaccine well , showing total absence of symptoms . 
The vaccine strain was isolated from faeces of only one dog in the ® rst 2 days after immunization but was undetectable afterwards . 
In an initial experiment , four dogs were vaccinated with 5 1010 LVR01 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) in PBS ; two others received PBS alone and were kept as controls . 
Sera were taken weekly and tested by ELISA for antibodies against S. typhimurium LPS , TetC or rEgDf1 .

Anti-LPS IgG antibody titers
Dog Week 4 Week 6 Week 9 b munization sera were negative for all three antigens in all dogs . 
Of two unimmunized dogs , one was consist-ently negative for all antigens , whereas the other was positive for anti-LPS antibodies in serum Ð but not in saliva Ð by week 4 of the experiment . 
For the dogs immunised with LVR01 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) , although all animals developed high titers of IgG anti-LPS antibodies in serum by week 4 after a single dose of the recombinant bacteria ( Table 1 ) , none developed antibodies against TetC or EgDf1 . 
Dogs received a second and a third dose at week 6 and week 7 after priming . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , three out of four immunized dogs developed an IgG antibody response against both TetC and EgDf1 on week 7 , a week after the ® rst booster . 
Dog number 2 , which did not show an anti-TetC response , is the same animal which failed to develop an anti-EgDf1 response , and this lack of responsiveness was still observed at week 9 , two weeks after the second booster ( Fig. 1 ) . 
IgA responses in serum were detected against LPS , but not against any of the two recombinant antigens ( results not shown ) . 
Further , ELISA determination of speci ® c IgA in saliva showed that all immunized dogs developed an anti ¬

LPS IgA response in saliva , although in dog number 2 this was only detectable on week 9 , after the animals received a second booster ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In a second experiment , three dogs were immunized with 5 1010 LVR01 ( pTECH ± EgDf1 ) and boosted with the same dose at weeks 3 and 4 after priming . 
Vaccination did not induce fever or diarrhoea in any of the dogs . 
Two littermates were again kept as controls ; serum samples from these unimmunized controls remained negative for all three antigens throughout the experiment . 
Again , all immunized dogs developed strong IgG and IgA anti-LPS responses in serum and saliva , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Further , analysis of the IgG antibody responses to the heterologous antigens showed that all immunized dogs developed an anti-TetC IgG response in serum by week 4 , after the ® rst booster , and that two out of three dogs showed also IgG anti-EgDf1 antibodies in serum ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The IgG1/IgG2 pro ® le of the serum antibody responses against LPS , TetC and EgDf1 was evaluated . 
IgG2 responses were elicited against all three antigens , whereas the IgG1 responses in all cases were almost undetect-able ( Fig. 5 ) . 
As in the ® rst experiment , no IgA responses against the recombinant antigens were found in serum or saliva . 
Given the small number of animals in these experiments , no statistical analysis was performed . 
3.3. T cell responses
The T cell responses elicited by the recombinant sal-monella vaccines were evaluated in dogs from the second experiment three weeks after the last immunization . 
Blood samples were taken and PBMC prepared and cultured in the presence of the di $ erent antigens , using Concanavalin A as a positive control and cultures without antigen as negative controls .

following stimulation with the di $ erent antigens were evaluated . 
Clear antigen speci ® c proliferation could be detected in all immunized dogs when cells were stimulated with either salmonella antigens or TetC , but only one out of three dogs developed speci ® c proliferation upon stimulation with EgDf1 ( Table 2 ) . 
4. Discussion
Live recombinant Salmonella that express heter-ologous antigens from other pathogens could have a broad application in veterinary medicine as oral multivalent vaccines . 
Although Salmonella-based delivery systems have been evaluated in combination with numerous antigens in mice , little work has been conducted in veterinary or domestic animals . 
Antigen delivery systems optimized in laboratory animals may show signi ® cant di $ erences in outbred populations . 
In particular , very little is known about how the speci - ® city of the relationship between vector and host might in ¯ uence cellular and humoral immunity to a recombinant antigen delivered by the vector . 
There are few reports on the use of salmonella vectors for vaccination of large animals but some general trends have emerged from the few published studies . 
In general , Salmonella strains that work well in mice may not necessarily reproduce the same immunogeni-city when used in large animals . 
Studies in calves have shown that attenuated vaccines , based on S. typhimur-ium or S. dublin calf isolates , are capable of eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses locally and at systemic level to Salmonella and heterologous antigens [ 16 ± 19 ] . 
Such Salmonella strains can confer partial protection against the pathogen from which the heter-ologous antigen was derived [ 19 ] . 
Attempts to use the mouse adapted S. typhimurium SL3261 expressing antigens from Theileria annulata to vaccinate calves resulted in poor immunogenicity to the T. annulata antigen and no protection [ 17 ] . 
Interestingly , both antigens were completely protective in calves , when admi-nistered as recombinant proteins in ISCOMs or as naked DNA vaccines [ 17 ] . 
The use of S. typhimurium SR-11 based vaccines to deliver a recombinant protein from Brucella abortus to the porcine immune system , resulted in the generation of weak antibody responses and a lack of cellular responses [ 35 ] . 
The vaccine strain colonized the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes of pigs but was not detected in liver and spleen . 
The authors postulated that the use of strains capable of invading to a systemic level in pigs , could be an advantage . 
In a later study using a more invasive , attenuated S. cholerasuis strain to vaccine pigs a cell-mediated response was detected against the same antigen [ 21 ] . 
A single report on immunization of cats , using SL3261 to express a fusion of the Gag protein of feline immunode ® ciency virus ( FIV ) , showed that two intra-peritoneal immunizations were required to elicit a weak responses to Gag [ 36 ] . 
No anti-Gag responses could be detected using the oral route of immunization and no protection was a $ orded against a FIV challenge using either route [ 36 ] . 
Using a galE strain of S. typhimurium LT2 expressing an antigen from E. multi locularis for oral and subcutaneous immunization of dogs , Gottstein et al. found that only weak antibody responses and no cellular responses could be detected against either salmonella antigens or the recombinant antigen by either route [ 37 ] . 
This work presented preliminary results using only one dog per group . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the use of strains that are adapted to infect particular host species should be considered for the construction of e $ ective salmonella vaccine vectors . 
We have developed a system that allows the rapid attenuation of strains of S. typhimurium from di $ erent origins , and this approach could be used for the preparation of species-speci ® c live salmonella vectors . 
Further , the ease of construction of di $ erent mutants should prove useful when searching for an optimum delivery vehicle for a particular species . 
S. typhimurium strains with di $ erent genetic backgrounds , harboring the same attenuating mutation and expressing a recombinant antigen at the same level , can di $ er signi ® cantly in their capacity to elicit immune responses towards a heterologous antigen [ 38 ] . 
Here , we demonstrate that an attenuated strain prepared from a dog isolate can e $ ectively present heter-ologous antigens to the dog 's immune system via the oral route , eliciting both humoral and cellular responses . 
Two oral doses were su cient to elicit antibody as well as cellular responses to at least one of the recombinant antigens carried by the bacteria . 
Plasmid pTECH ± EgDf1 directs the expression of EgDf1 as a fusion protein with TetC . 
Although clear T cell responses were obtained against the TetC part of the fusion , only one out of three dogs showed speci ® c proliferation upon in vitro stimulation with EgDf1 . 
In contrast , when testing this vaccine in mice , strong T cell responses , measured as cytokine release , could be readily detected against both components of the fusion [ 29 ] . 
It may be that the immunogenicity of EgDf1 differs between dogs and mice or alternatively the recombinant Salmonella may be processed di $ erently by the canine immune system . 
In all cases , these results reinforce the concept that care has to be taken when extrapolating from results in mice . 
ELISA analysis of the IgG subclasses of the antigenspeci ® c antibody response , shows a clear polarization towards the IgG2 subclass for all antigens tested . 
Using the salmonella delivery system for studies conducted in mice , it has been shown that the immune responses elicited are biased to a Th1 pro ® le [ 39 ± 42 ] . 
It is not known if such distinct Th1/Th2 responses exist in dogs . 
However , a di $ erential IgG1/IgG2 production pro ® le in dogs against infection with Leishmania infantum has been described , with the production of IgG2 being associated with asymptomatic infections and IgG1 with disease [ 43,44 ] . 
Those results , together with the results presented here , could be taken to suggest that in dogs the IgG2 subclass would be associated with a Th1 response , whereas the production of IgG1 would be associated with a Th2 response . 
It should be interesting to correlate the IgG subclasses of the antibody responses to the recombinant antigens delivered by Salmonella , with the in vitro production of cyto-kines upon stimulation with those antigens . 
Work in that direction is currently under way in our laboratories . 
In summary , the results suggest that S. typhimurium LVR01 is avirulent in dogs and this strain may be considered as a carrier for recombinant antigens in the construction of oral multivalent vaccines for dogs . 
LVR01 expressing heterologous antigens can elicit humoral and cellular responses by the oral route , and could be the basis for the construction of an oral vaccine for dogs against E. granulosus . 
At present , we are focussing on the selection of new E. granulosus antigens to be delivered by LVR01 .
