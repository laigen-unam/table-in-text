Pathogenic bacteria modify the structure of the lipid A portion of their lipopolysaccharide in response to environmental changes . 
Some lipid A modifications are important for virulence and resistance to cationic anti-microbial peptides . 
The two-component system PhoP / PhoQ plays a central role in regulating lipid A modification . 
We now report the discovery of a PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene ( pagL ) in Salmonella typhimurium , encoding a deacylase that removes the R-3-hydroxymyr-istate moiety attached at position 3 of certain lipid A precursors . 
The deacylase gene ( pagL ) was identified by assaying for loss of deacylase activity in extracts of 14 random TnphoA : : pag insertion mutants . 
The pagL gene encodes a protein of 185 amino acid residues unique to S. typhimurium and closely related organisms such as Salmonella typhi . 
Heterologous expression of pagL in Escherichia coli on plasmid pWLP21 results in loss of the R-3-hydroxymyristate moiety at position 3 in ; 90 % of the lipid A molecules but does not inhibit cell growth . 
PagL is synthesized with a 20-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and is localized mainly in the outer membrane , as judged by assays of separated S. typhimurium membranes and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of membranes from E. coli cells that overexpress PagL . 
The function of PagL is unknown , given that S. typhimurium mutants lacking pagL display no obvious phenotypes , but PagL might nevertheless play a role in pathogenesis if it serves to modulate the cytokine response of an infected animal host . 
Pathogenic bacteria are capable of sensing microenvironments within the tissues of their animal hosts , leading to the expression of virulence genes necessary for bacterial survival and replication ( 1 , 2 ) . 
In Salmonella typhimurium and Salmo-nella typhi , some virulence genes are controlled by the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ ( 3 , 4 ) . 
At low levels of Mg21 , the PhoQ sensor protein phosphorylates and activates the transcriptional regulatory protein PhoP , which in turn either activates or represses over 40 different genetic loci ( 5 , 6 ) .

A second two-component regulatory system , PmrA/PmrB , is itself PhoP/PhoQ-activated ( 5 , 7 ) . 
PmrA is also activated directly by the PmrB kinase in the presence of ferric ions or indirectly at low pH ( 8 ) . 
Mutants altered in the PhoP/PhoQ system display greatly reduced virulence ( 9 , 10 ) . 
Homologues of both regulatory systems are present in other Gram-negative bacteria , including Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Yersinia pestis ( 4 , 11 ) . 
Among their many functions , the PhoP/PhoQ and the PmrA / PmrB systems regulate the expression of gene products involved in the covalent modification of lipid A ( 12 ) , the glycolipid 1 anchor of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
LPS is a major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria , and the lipid A portion of LPS is the bioactive component that is also known as endotoxin ( 13 -- 16 ) . 
During bacterial infections of animals , lipid A activates the innate immune system through interaction with Toll-like receptors , primarily TLR-4 ( 17 -- 20 ) . 
The host response to lipid A includes the production of cationic antimicrobial peptides , cytokines , tissue factor , and additional immunostimulatory molecules ( 19 -- 22 ) . 
In limited infections , the response to lipid A helps to clear the bacteria , but in overwhelming sepsis , high levels of circulating cytokines and procoagulant activity may damage the microvasculature and precipitate the syndrome of Gram-negative septic shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 23 , 24 ) . 
The structure of lipid A is relatively conserved among different pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 25 ) . 
Lipid A of E. coli and S. typhimurium is a b,19-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine , phosphorylated at the 1 - and 49-positions and acylated at the 2 - , 3 - , 29 - , and 39-positions with R-3-hydroxy-myristate ( Fig. 1 ) ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 25 ) . 
The OH groups of the R-3-hydroxymyristate chains that are attached at positions 29 and 39 are further acylated with laurate and myristate , respectively ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 25 ) . 
Lipid A is glycosylated at position 69 with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid ( Kdo ) moieties ( Fig. 1 ) ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 25 ) . 
Under certain circumstances , additional covalent modifications of lipid A are present , including 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose ( 4-aminoarabinose ) , phosphoethanolamine , palmitate , and/or 2-hydroxymyristate moieties ( Fig. 1 ) ( 12 , 26 -- 28 ) . 
In S. typhimurium , Miller and co-workers have shown that incorporation of palmitate and 2-OH myristate moieties ( 12 , 29 ) is controlled by PhoP/PhoQ , whereas the 4-aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine modifications require the activation of PmrA ( 27 , 30 ) . 
PhoP-PhoQ mutants are more sensitive to the action of certain cationic antimicrobial peptides , in part because of the loss of palmitoylation of lipid A in the absence of the function of the

PhoP-activated gene pagP ( 29 ) . 
We have recently shown that pagP is the structural gene for a novel acyltransferase ( 31 ) ( Fig. 2 ) that utilizes glycerophospholipids as palmitate donors ( 31 , 32 ) . 
PagP is the first example of a lipid A biosynthetic enzyme localized to the outer membrane ( 31 ) . 
In the course of characterizing lipid A modifications in extracts of different S. typhimurium mutants , we have discovered a novel 3-O-deacylase activity that is strongly regulated by PhoP/PhoQ ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In the present study , we demonstrate that the 3-O-deacylase , like the PagP acyltransferase , is found mainly in the outer membrane . 
By assaying for 3-O-deacylase activity in extracts of PhoP-constitutive S. typhimurium strains harboring insertion mutations in different PhoP-acti-vated ( pag ) genes ( 33 ) , the structural gene ( pagL ) encoding the deacylase was identified . 
The pagL gene was sequenced and shown to be unique to strains of Salmonella . 
When expressed in E. coli , PagL activity is localized in the outer membrane , and extensive lipid A 3-O-deacylation occurs without loss of cell viability . 
The function of pagL is unknown , since nonpolar deletions of S. typhimurium pagL display no obvious phenotypes . 
However , partial 3-O-deacylation of Salmonella lipid A could be advantageous under certain conditions , since it might modulate the cytokine response of the host during an infection . 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Chemicals and Other Materials -- [ g-32P ] ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences . 
Silica gel 60 ( 0.25-mm ) thin layer plates were purchased from EM Separation Technologies . 
Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco . 
Triton X-100 and bicinchoninic acid were from Pierce . 
All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt . 
Bacterial Strains -- The bacterial strains used in the present study are described in Table I. Typically , bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium , which consists of 10 g of NaCl , 10 g of tryptone , and 5 g of yeast extract per liter ( 34 ) . 
In experiments involving Mg21 limitation or pH changes , cells were grown in N-minimal medium ( 35 ) with varying concentrations of Mg21 at pH 7.7 in 100 mM Tris-HCl or at pH 5.8 in 100 mM bis-Tris buffer at 37 °C . 
Cells ( 10 ml ) were first grown overnight at pH 7.7 , harvested by centrifugation , washed twice with 5 ml of Nminimal medium at pH 7.7 , and diluted 1:100 into N-minimal medium at pH 5.8 or 7.7 , containing either low ( 10 mM ) or high ( 10 mM ) MgCl . 
2 Cells were then grown into late log phase at 37 °C and harvested at A600 ranging from 0.65 to 1.0 . 
When appropriate , cultures were supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin , 12 mg/ml tetracycline , 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol , or 30 mg/ml kanamycin . 
Preparation of Radiolabeled Substrates -- The substrate [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA was prepared using 100 mCi of [ g32-P ] ATP , tetraacyl-disaccharide 1-phosphate acceptor and membranes from E. coli that overexpress the 49-kinase , as previously described ( 36 ) , with the following minor changes . 
After the 49-kinase reaction was completed , the assay mixture was spotted onto a 10 3 20-cm TLC plate . 
The plate was dried under a cold air stream and developed in the solvent system chloroform/pyridine/88 % formic acid/water ( 50:50:16:5 , v/v/v / v ) . 
Following chromatography , the plate was dried again and exposed to x-ray film for 30 s to locate the [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA . 
The region of the silica plate containing the product was removed by scraping , transferred to a thick walled glass tube , and resuspended in 3 ml of an acidic single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture ( 37 ) , consisting of chloroform/methanol/0 .1 M HCl ( 1:2:0.8 , v/v / v ) . 
The suspension was vigorously mixed with the aid of a vortex and subjected to sonic irradiation for 30 s . 
The silica particles were removed with a clinical centrifuge set at top speed for 10 min . 
The supernatant containing the 32P labeled lipid was removed , and the extraction proc-ess was repeated . 
The extracted materials were pooled . 
The solution was then converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture ( 37 ) , consisting of chloroform/methanol/0 .1 M HCl ( 2:2:1.8 , v/v/v ) . 
The phases were separated in a clinical centrifuge , and the lower phase was removed to a separate tube . 
The resulting upper phase was extracted a second time by the addition of fresh preequilibrated lower phase . 
The lower phases were pooled and dried under a stream of N2 . 
Finally , the dried lipid was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , and stored at 220 °C . 
To prepare Kdo2 - [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA , the purified E. coli Kdo transferase was added to the system immediately after the 49-kinase , as previously described ( 36 ) . 
The Kdo - [ 49-32 2 P ] lipid IVA was isolated as described above with the exception that 50 mM ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 1.5 was used as the aqueous component instead of 0.1 M HCl in all Bligh/Dyer systems . 
The final yields of the desired radioactive lipid products ranged between 40 and 60 mCi from 100 mCi of [ g32-P ] ATP used as the starting material . 
Both lipid products were stored as aqueous dispersions at 280 °C and subjected to sonic irradiation for 1 min in a bath sonicator prior to use ( 36 ) . 
Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Membranes -- Typically , 100-ml cultures of bacteria were grown to an A600 of 1.0 at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 3 g for 15 min . 
All steps were carried out at 4 °C . 
Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , at a protein concentration of ; 3 -- 8 mg/ml and broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. . 
The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 7,000 3 g for 15 min . 
Membranes were prepared by two centrifugation steps at 149,000 3 g for 60 min with a wash of the crude membranes in 5 ml of 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , after the first centrifugation to ensure the removal of all cytosolic components . 
The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , at a protein concentration of ; 5 -- 10 mg/ml . 
Cytosol from the first 149,000 3 g centrifugation was subjected to a second centrifugation step for complete removal of small membrane fragments . 
All samples were stored in aliquots at 280 °C , and protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid ( 38 ) , with bovine serum albumin as the standard . 
3-O-Deacylase Assay -- The 3-O-deacylase activity was assayed under optimized conditions in a 10-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mM Hepes , pH 8.0 , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 M NaCl , and 10 mM [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA ( 50,000 cpm/nmol ) . 
Reaction tubes were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times . 
The assays were stopped by spotting 5-ml portions of the reaction mixtures onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate . 
For further characterization of the 3-O-deacylase activity , the PhoPC pagP - Salmonella mutant strain ( Table I ) was used as the enzyme source to avoid other further acylation of the [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA substrate by PagP ( 31 ) . 
Thin Layer Chromatography -- When [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA was employed as the substrate , the reaction products were separated using the solvent system chloroform/pyridine/88 % formic acid/water ( 50:50:16:5 , v/v/v / v ) . 
For reactions containing Kdo2 - [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA as the substrate , plates were developed in chloroform/pyridine/88 % formic acid/water ( 30:70:16 : 10 , v/v/v / v ) . 
Finally , reaction products from assays containing 32P-la-beled lipid X ( 39 , 40 ) as the substrate were separated using the solvent chloroform/methanol/water / acetic acid ( 25:15:4:2 , v/v/v / v ) . 
Reaction products were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software . 
The enzyme activity was calculated by determining the percentage of the substrate converted to product , and the specific activity was expressed as nmol/min/mg . 
Mild Alkaline Base Hydrolysis Using Triethylamine -- The 3-O-deac-ylated lipid IVA reaction product was generated in a 50-ml reaction mixture for 2 h , as described above , using membranes from the PhoPC pagP - S. typhimurium mutant strain . 
Mild base hydrolysis was carried out by the addition of triethylamine to a final concentration of 30 % , and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C ( 41 ) . 
At the indicated times , 3-ml portions of the reaction mixture were removed and mixed with 3 ml of water , after which 5 ml of the resulting mixture was spotted onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate and developed in chloroform/pyidine/88 % formic acid / water ( 50:50:16:10 , v/v/v / v ) . 
As a control , the [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA substrate was also subjected to triethylamine hydrolysis under the same conditions ( 41 ) . 
Separation of Inner and Outer Membranes -- Membranes from various strains of E. coli , S. typhimurium , or P. aeruginosa were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation . 
First , washed membranes were prepared as described above and were resuspended in 10 mM

Regulated modifications of the structure of Kdo2-lipid A in S. typhimurium . 
The phosphate residues and acyl chains of lipid A in S. typhimurium can be derivatized in a regulated fashion ( 12 ) . 
The phosphate moieties of lipid A can be substituted with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose and/or phosphoethanolamine groups , both of which are under PmrA/B control ( blue substituents ) ( 26 , 56 ) . 
Minor species are present in which the locations of the 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose and phosphoethanolamine groups are reversed ( 57 ) ( Z. Zhou and C. R. H. Raetz , manuscript in preparation ) or in which both phosphates are modified with the same substituent ( not shown ) . 
The addition of the palmitate chain is catalyzed by PagP , as indicated ( 31 ) , and formation of the 2-hydroxymyristate group ( X ) requires a novel hydroxylase homologue , designated LpxO ( 58 ) . 
The ester-linked b-hydroxymyristoyl chain at the 3-position may be removed by the outer membrane lipase PagL , as indicated . 
Substituents that are incorporated or removed in a PhoP/Q-dependent manner are shown in red .

Hepes , pH 7.0 , containing 0.05 mM EDTA at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml . 
Membranes were applied to a seven-step gradient , prepared as described by Guy-Caffey et al. ( 42 , 43 ) , and subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW40 .1 rotor for 19 h at 3 °C . 
The gradient was collected in ; 0.5-ml fractions . 
Each fraction was then assayed for NADH oxidase as the inner membrane marker and for phospholipase A as the outer membrane marker , as previously described ( 44 ) . 
The amount of protein in each fraction was determined using the bicincho-ninic acid assay ( 38 ) . 
Each fraction was also assayed for the 3-O-deacylase activity using the standard conditions described above . 
Recombinant DNA Techniques -- Plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen Spin Prep kit . 
DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit . 
T4 DNA ligase ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , restriction endonucleases ( New England BioLabs ) , and shrimp alkaline phosphatase ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Sequencing of pagL Gene -- Initial sequence of the pagL region was obtained by sequencing pBB04EL , a plasmid containing the pagL : : TnphoA 59 fusion junction ( 30 ) . 
Sequence was obtained in both directions using standard techniques with a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer equipped with Sequencher 3.0 software . 
The pagL sequence was subsequently verified from chromosomal DNA cloned into pBluescript ( pWLP21 ) as described below . 
Construction of a PhoPC pagL Deletion Mutant -- A nonpolar deletion of greater than 95 % of the coding sequence of pagL was created using PCR amplification of flanking DNA with Pfu ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The flanking DNA was subsequently cloned into the allelic exchange vector , pKAS32 ( 45 ) , resulting in the plasmid pWLP24 containing the DpagL construct . 
Allelic exchange was performed in strain CS401 , as has been described ( 46 ) . 
Resolution of the integrant resulted in a DpagL strain CS586 , which was verified using PCR and Southern blot analysis . 
To create a nonpolar DpagL in a background that constitutively expresses PhoP/PhoQ , P22HTint bacteriophage was grown on the CS401 pWLP24 integrant , and the integrated plasmid was transduced into the PhoPC streptomycin-resistant strain CS491 . 
Resolution of the C integrated plasmid resulted in a PhoP DpagL strain , CS584 . 
The successful deletion of pagL was verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis . 
Construction of pWLP21 and pWLP23 -- The pagL gene and its flanking sequences , including 79 base pairs upstream and 168 base pairs downstream , were amplified by PCR from S. typhimurium 14028 genomic DNA with Pfu Turbo ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The PCR product was cloned into both the high copy vector pBluescript KS II1 ( pWLP21 ) and the low copy vector pWKS30 ( pWLP23 ) ( Table II ) . 
Overexpression of PagL behind a T7 Promoter -- The pagL gene was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using S. typhimurium 14028 genomic DNA as the template . 
The PCR product was cloned into pET21a ( 1 ) under the control of the T7 promoter to overexpress the enzyme giving the construct , pPagL . 
The pagL construct was transformed into BLR ( DE3 ) / pLysS ( Novagen ) for overexpression of PagL . 
First , a single colony of E. coli BLR ( DE3 ) / pLysS containing pPagL was inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium and grown to an A600 5 0.8 . 
The culture was then used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LB medium , and at A600 of ; 0.6 , the cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Crude extracts , membrane-free cytosol , and washed membranes were prepared as described above . 
Protein Gel Electrophoresis -- Protein extracts were analyzed using the Bio-Rad Protean II XI apparatus . 
Samples containing 40 mg of protein were solubilized in 1⁄3 volume of 23 SDS buffer and heated for 5 min . 
Samples were applied to a 1.5-mm-thick 15 % polyacrylamide SDS gel with a 4 % stacking gel ( 22.2 3 20 cm ) and were subjected to electrophoresis at 100 V. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye ( 2.5 mg/ml ) in water/methanol/acetic acid ( 6:4:1 , v/v/v ) and were then destained with water/methanol/acetic acid ( 6:4:1 , v/v/v ) . 
Prestained low range standards from Bio-Rad were used to estimate molecular weight . 
Protein Microsequencing -- Protein from the outer membrane fraction of the E. coli expression strain BLR ( DE3 ) pLysS containing the T7 pagL construct ( pPagL ) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis as described above . 
The portion of the gel containing the PagL protein was excised , and the protein was transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore Corp. ) in 10 mM CAPS , pH 11 , in 10 % methanol at 15 V for 30 min using the Bio-Rad Semi-Dry Transfer apparatus . 
Transferred protein was stained with 0.1 % Ponceau S in 1 % acetic acid for 1 min and then destained with 1 % acetic acid for 10 min . 
The PagL protein band was excised , rinsed three times with distilled water , and subjected to high sensitivity protein microsequencing on ABI model 492A Procise Sequencer at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Core Laboratory for Protein Microsequencing and Mass Spectrometry ( Worcester , MA ) . 
Large Scale Isolation of Lipid A from E. coli Cells Expressing the Heterologous pagL Gene -- Cultures ( 100 ml ) of the E. coli strain XL-1 Blue were grown in LB medium at 37 °C containing either pBluescript ( Stratagene ) or pWLP21 . 
After A600 of ; 1.0 was reached , cells were harvested , resuspended in 80 ml of phosphate-buffered saline ( 47 ) , and frozen prior to lipid A isolation . 
Lipid A was released from cells and purified as previously described and stored frozen at 280 °C ( 28 , 48 ) . 
Mass Spectrometry of Lipid A Species -- Spectra were obtained in the negative linear mode using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight Bruker BiflexIII mass spectrometer ( Bruker Daltonics , Inc. , Billerica , MA ) . 
Each spectrum was the average of 100 shots . 
Lipid samples were dissolved in chloroform/methanol ( 4:1 , v/v ) before mixing with the matrix ( lipid/matrix ; 9:1 , v/v ) . 
The matrix consisted of saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50 % acetonitrile and 10 % ammonium sulfate . 
The mixtures were allowed to dry at room temperature on the sample plate prior to mass analysis .

A PhoP/PhoQ-dependent Deacylase in S. typhimurium Membranes -- As shown in Fig. 3A , membranes from a strain of S. typhimurium in which the PhoP transcriptional regulatory protein is constitutively active ( PhoPC ) ( 49 ) are capable of converting the lipid A precursor , [ 49-32P ] lipid IV , to a more hydro-A philic product ( lane 3 ) with an R of 0.28 . 
This product , denoted F as deacyl-IVA , is the same as that produced by the 3-O-deacy-lases of Rhizobium etli and of P. aeruginosa , previously characterized by Basu et al. ( 41 ) . 
The faster migrating species , lipid IVB , arises by the addition of a palmitate chain to the amide-linked b-hydroxymyristate residue at position 2 of lipid IVA ( 31 , 32 ) , catalyzed by the pagP gene product ( 31 ) ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The additional radioactive lipid shown in lane 3 ( designated deacyl-IVB ) results from both the addition of a palmitate chain and 3-O-deacylation of [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA ( Fig. 2 ) . 
When membranes from a PhoPC strain , also harboring a pagP mutation ( 31 ) , were used , both products containing palmitate were eliminated ( lane 5 ) . 
Membranes from wild-type S. typhimurium grown in LB broth ( Fig. 3 , lane 2 ) or in minimal medium ( pH 7.4 ) containing 10 mM Mg21 ( Fig. 3 , lane 8 ) , conditions under which the PhoP / PhoQ system is inactive , showed little or no deacylase activity . 
In membranes from cells grown in minimal medium ( pH 7.4 ) containing 10 mM Mg21 , however , the 3-O-deacylase was very active ( Fig. 3 , lane 9 ) , consistent with PhoP/PhoQ regulation ( 5 , 12 ) . 
The specific activity of the deacylase in membranes of either the PhoPC strain or of wild-type S. typhimurium cells grown in limiting Mg21 was ; 0.50 nmol/min/mg . 
Membranes from a PhoPC strain with a pagP deletion displayed even higher specific activity ( ; 1.35 nmol/min/mg ) . 
Since palmitoylation of lipid IVA by PagP represents a competing reaction in C 2 Salmonella membranes , a PhoP pagP strain was routinely used for further characterization of the deacylase . 
The PmrA/PmrB two-component system was previously implicated in the covalent modification of lipid A with phosphoethanolamine and 4-aminoarabinose ( 26 , 27 , 30 ) and was therefore tested as a regulator of the 3-O-deacylase . 
Membranes from an S. typhimurium strain in which the transcriptional regulatory protein PmrA is constitutively active ( PmrAC ) showed no deacylase activity ( Fig. 3 , lane 6 ) . 
Also , growth in minimal medium at a pH of 5.8 , a condition known to activate the PmrA/PmrB system ( 5 ) , failed to induce deacylase activity unless the Mg21 concentration was also limiting ( 10 mM ) ( data not shown ) . 
As previously demonstrated by Basu et al. ( 41 ) , E. coli membranes do not possess a deacylase when cells are grown in broth . 
Similarly , we found that growth in minimal medium containing 10 mM Mg21 at pH 7.4 or 5.8 was unable to induce deacylase activity in membranes of E. coli MC1061 or W3110 ( data not shown ) . 
Mild Alkaline Hydrolysis of the S. typhimurium 3-O-Deacyl-ase Reaction Product -- Hydrolysis of lipid A and its precursors with the mild base triethylamine at 30 °C results in the selective removal of the 3-O-linked b-hydroxymyristoyl group , followed by gradual removal of the 39-O-linked fatty acyl moiety ( 41 ) . 
The triethylamine deacylation products of [ 49-32P ] lipid IV are easily separated by TLC , are well characterized , and A can be used as standards ( 41 ) . 
The [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA substrate ( Fig. 4A ) and the 49-32P hydrophilic reaction product generated by PhoPC pagP - Salmonella membranes ( Fig. 4B ) were treated in parallel with triethylamine . 
As shown in Fig. 4A , treatment of [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA with triethylamine results in gradual removal of both ester-linked fatty acids , giving rise to the 3 - or 39-O-deacylated materials as intermediates and the doubly O-deacylated species as the final product . 
The hydrophilic species generated from [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA by PhoPC pagP - Salmonella membranes ( Fig. 4B ) migrates the same as the 3-O-deacylated [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA standard ( Fig. 4A ) . 
Further treatment of this product ( Fig. 4B ) with triethylamine results in formation of a compound migrating like doubly O-deacylated [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA . 
These results demonstrate that the hydrophilic material generated from [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA by PhoPC pagP - Salmonella membranes is probably a 3-O-deacylated species and does not contain some other hydrophilic unit that slows its migration during TLC analysis . 
Assay Conditions and Catalytic Properties of the PhoP / PhoQ-regulated 3-O-Deacylase -- The 3-O-deacylation of [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA is absolutely dependent upon the presence of the nonionic detergent , Triton X-100 , with optimal activity at 0.1 % . 
The pH optimum is 8.0 , but significant activity is observed from pH 5.5 to 9.0 . 
Divalent cations are not required . 
EDTA and EGTA have no effect . 
Increased activity is observed with higher ionic strength . 
Accordingly , 0.5 M NaCl is included in the assay system ( data not shown ) . 
The substrate specificity of the enzyme is relatively broad ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The deacylase does not require the Kdo moiety for activity , showing a slightly higher activity with 10 mM [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA than with 10 mM Kdo2 - [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA . 
The relative rate of deacylation is decreased ; 10-fold when the monosaccharide precursor , lipid X ( 40 , 50 ) , is used as the substrate ( Fig. 5 ) at 10 mM . 
Product formation by the deacylase with 10 mM [ 49-32P ] lipid IVA is linearly dependent upon both protein concentration ( data not shown ) and times less than 10 min ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Interestingly , we have so far been unable to demonstrate activity with hexa-acylated lipid A as the substrate ( data not shown ) , raising an interesting paradox in light of the subcellular localization of the enzyme ( see below ) . 
The assay conditions for the Rhizobium leguminosarum/etli 3-O-deacylase ( 41 ) differ from those for the S. typhimurium enzyme with regard to pH optimum , Triton X-100 dependence , and requirement for divalent cations . 
Optimal deacylation conditions for P. aeruginosa membranes resemble those for the Salmonella enzyme ( data not shown ) . 
However , the 3-O-deac-ylase of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 is present in membranes prepared from cultures grown in LB broth ( 41 ) . 
The deacylase activity of PAO1 is not increased in membranes prepared from cells grown in the presence of low Mg21 ( 10 mM ) ( data not shown ) . 
Last , PhoP null mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1 still make 3-O-deacylated lipid A species when grown in the presence of low Mg21 , whereas modifications with 4-aminoarabi-nose and palmitate are lost ( 11 ) . 
The combined data suggest that the 3-O-deacylase of PAO1 is regulated differently than the Salmonella enzyme . 
Outer Membrane Localization of the S. typhimurium 3-O-Deacylase -- The deacylase activity of S. typhimurium is localized in the particulate fraction ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Further separation by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation reveals that the enzyme is mainly an outer membrane protein ( Fig. 7 ) , although a small but significant fraction of the activity is also seen in the inner membrane . 
NADH oxidase serves as the inner membrane marker , whereas phospholipase A activity is used to locate outer membrane fragments ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Besides PagP ( 31 ) , the 3-O-deacylase of S. typhimurium is only the second example of an outer membrane protein involved in lipid A modification . 
The 3-O-deacylase of P. aeruginosa is also localized mainly in the outer membrane fraction ( data not shown ) . 
Identification of the Structural Gene ( pagL ) Encoding the 3-O-Deacylase of S. typhimurium -- Previously , several S. typhi-murium PhoP-activated ( pag ) genes were mutated using a TnphoA transposon in a PhoPC background ( 51 ) . 
Since the deacylase is greatly induced in the PhoPC background , loss of enzymatic activity in the membranes of a particular pag mutant could reveal the structural gene encoding the deacylase or , alternatively , additional regulatory protein ( s ) necessary for de-acylase expression . 
Membranes of strains containing single , distinct TnphoA mutations ( Table I ) were prepared and assayed for 3-O-deacylase activity . 
Out of 14 available pag mutants , only one ( CS328 ) showed a loss of deacylase activity ( Fig. 8 ) . 
CS328 contains an insertion in a previously unreported PhoP activated gene , designated pagL . 
The palmitoyltransferase ( PagP ) activity is still present in CS328 and all other pag mutant strains except for CS330 , which harbors a pagP insertion . 
Using the DNA sequence of the transposon as the starting point , the sequence of the inactivated pag gene ( pagL ) was determined . 
A novel open reading frame was identified ( Fig. 9 ) . 
Comparison of the predicted PagL amino acid sequence with putative proteins in the nonredundant and incomplete microbial data bases using the BLASTp or tBLASTn programs ( 52 , 53 ) revealed no obvious homologues of PagL except in other strains of Salmonella . 
Analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated the presence of a 15-amino acid type I signal peptide using the Signal-P Program ( 54 ) , supporting the view that the protein may be localized to the outer membrane fraction . 
The uncleaved protein has a predicted molecular mass of ; 20 kDa and a pI of ; 9.0 . 
A nonpolar deletion compromising greater than 95 % of the pagL coding sequence was generated in the S. typhimurium strain CS401 ( 46 ) , followed by transduction of the mutation into the PhoPC streptomycin-resistant strain , CS491 . 
Membranes of CS584 ( phoPCDpagL ) contained no deacylase , as shown in Fig. 10 , lane 2 , when assayed under optimal conditions at 0.01 mg/ml for 10 min or even at 2 mg/ml ( data not shown ) . 
To demonstrate that recovery of deacylase activity was dependent upon the pagL gene , pagL and its flanking 59 and 39 sequences were cloned into the low copy vector , pWKS30 , and the resulting plasmid was named pWLP23 . 
The 3-O-deacylase activity of CS584 was recovered upon transformation with pWLP23 ( Fig. 10 , lane 4 ) . 
Introduction of the vector control had no effect on deacylase activity ( Fig. 10 , lane 3 ) . 
Although these data are strongly suggestive , they do not unequivocally prove that pagL is the structural gene encoding the deacylase . 
Heterologous Expression of pagL in E. coli -- To obtain additional evidence that pagL is the structural gene for the 3-O-deacylase , a heterologous E. coli expression system was established . 
Both the control pBluescript vector and pWLP21 were transformed into E. coli strain XL-1 Blue , and the lipid A of each strain was isolated and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry . 
The lipid A of XL-1 Blue , containing the control vector , consisted primarily of the hexa-acylated bis-phosphate species that is typically seen in E. coli K12 strains ( 28 , 48 ) , with [ M 2 H ] 2 at m/z 1796.9 atomic mass units in the negative mode ( Fig. 11A ) . 
However , upon overexpression of pagL , the [ M 2 H ] 2 of the predominant lipid A species was detected at m/z 1570 atomic mass units in the negative mode , corresponding to the loss of one b-hydroxymyristate residue from the major species seen in the vector control ( Fig. 11B ) . 
The additional species at m/z 1490 atomic mass units corresponds to loss of the phosphate group from the 1-position of the 3-O-deacylated lipid A , most likely a fragment ion , since analysis of the sample by TLC followed by charring showed no such lipid . 
Based upon mass spectroscopy , it can be concluded that selective lipid A deacylation occurs in living cells of this heterologous construct at the 3-position . 
Loss of b-hydroxymyristate at the 39-position would also lead to the loss of the secondary myristate chain , yielding a tetra-acylated lipid A variant with a molecular weight of 1361.7 , a species not seen in Fig. 11 . 
Furthermore , heterologous expression of pagL in E. coli did not slow down cell growth ( data not shown ) . 
There are no homologues of the pagL gene in E. coli , consist-ent with the observation that there is no 3-O-deacylase activity in E. coli membranes , irrespective of growth or assay conditions . 
The above data further support the view that pagL of S. typhimurium is the structural gene for the 3-O-deacylase . 
T7 Promoter-driven Overexpression of PagL and Its Localization in the Outer Membrane -- Overproduction of PagL protein was achieved by cloning the PCR-amplified pagL gene behind a T7 promoter into the expression vector pET21a , giving the plasmid pPagL . 
Membranes isolated from the E. coli expression strain BLR ( DE3 ) pLysS containing either pET21a or pPagL were assayed for 3-O-deacylase activity . 
The specific activity of the deacylase in membranes of PhoPC S. typhi-murium was 0.50 nmol/min/mg versus 155 nmol/min/mg in the induced T7 overexpression system , a 300-fold increase in activity . 
Membranes from the BLR ( DE3 ) pLysS vector control strain were inactive . 
As in PhoPC S. typhimurium ( Fig. 7 ) , the overexpressed PagL in E. coli was located largely in the outer membrane ( Fig. 12 ) . 
Comparison of the outer membranes of BLR ( DE3 ) pLysS containing either the control vector or pPagL shows overproduction of a protein migrating with the predicted molecular mass of mature PagL ( 18 kDa ) ( Fig. 12 ) in the latter . 
To verify the presence of the signal peptide predicted by the Signal-P program and to determine the cleavage site , PagL protein from outer membranes of BLR ( DE3 ) pLysS/pPagL was electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to microsequencing . 
The sequence of the first 10 amino acid residues was NVFFGKGNKH , indicating that cleavage of the signal peptide occurs between amino acid resi-dues 20 and 21 ( AND-NVF ) of PagL rather than between amino acids 15 and 16 as predicted by Signal-P ( 54 ) ( Fig. 9 ) . 
Thermal Stability of PagL -- The outer membrane enzyme PagP resists thermal denaturation ( 31 ) , since it retains ; 65 % of its enzymatic activity after a 10-min preincubation at 100 °C ( 32 ) . 
PagL displays similar behavior ( data not shown ) . 
The unusual thermal stability of both enzymes may be due to their relatively low molecular weights .

DISCUSSION
Over the past 15 years , nine constitutive enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis have been identified in E. coli ( 13 , 14 , 55 ) . 
With few exceptions , single copies of the corresponding structural genes are present in all Gram-negative bacteria . 
However , the enzymes and genes responsible for the covalent modifications of lipid A ( Fig. 1 ) , which are associated with bacterial virulence and polymyxin resistance , are not yet fully characterized ( 4 , 26 , 27 , 56 , 57 ) . 
It has been demonstrated that these modifications are controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB two-compo-nent regulatory systems ( 4 , 26 , 27 , 56 , 57 ) and also can be induced with metavanadate in E. coli ( 28 ) . 
The enzymatic function of the PhoP-activated lipid A palmitoyltransferase , PagP , was recently established in our laboratories ( 31 ) . 
Furthermore , the biosynthesis of the PhoP/PhoQ-dependent S-2-hydroxymyristate moiety found in the lipids A of S. typhi-murium and certain other pathogenic bacteria was shown to depend upon a novel lipid A hydroxylase homologue , designated LpxO ( 58 ) . 
We now present the initial characterization , cloning , and overexpression of another lipid A-modifying enzyme , PagL , an unusual PhoP/PhoQ-activated lipase that selectively removes the ester-linked 3-O-hydroxyacyl chains of certain lipid A precursors . 
The S. typhimurium lipid A 3-O-deacylase activity is under the control of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system and was discovered using an in vitro assay with the 32 tetra-acylated lipid A precursor , [ 49 - P ] lipid IVA , as the subC strate ( Fig. 3 ) . 
By assaying extracts of individual PhoP S. typhimurium strains harboring insertion mutations in 14 separate pag loci , the gene coding for the 3-O-deacylase ( pagL ) was C found ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Complementation of a PhoP DpagL S. typhi-murium mutant with a low copy pagL plasmid restored deac-ylase activity . 
Heterologous expression of pagL in E. coli , an organism with no deacylase activity of its own and no pagL homologue in its genome , resulted in the appearance of robust deacylase activity in extracts and in loss of the R-3-hydroxy-myristate moiety at position 3 in 90 % of the lipid A molecules . 
There was no associated impairment of cell growth . 
These data , taken together with the sequencing of the overproduced PagL protein , demonstrate that pagL is the structural gene for the 3-O-deacylase . 
Like the palmitoyltransferase PagP ( 31 ) , the 3-O-deacylase PagL is a small , thermally stable enzyme , and it is associated with outer membrane enzyme as judged by the following observations . 
1 ) Deacylase catalytic activity was detected mostly in outer membrane fragments of a PhoPC strain of S. typhi-murium by assay with the substrate lipid IV . 
2 ) Separation of A membranes from an E. coli strain overexpressing pagL behind a T7 promoter showed that the recombinant protein was largely recovered in the outer membrane fractions , as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 12 ) . 
3 ) The overexpressed PagL protein was missing its type I signal peptide , as shown by N-terminal sequencing of the outer mem-brane-associated band . 
Because of their small sizes , both PagP ( ; 19 kDa ) and PagL ( ; 18 kDa ) may adopt the smallest possible b-barrel conformation that is characteristic of outer membrane proteins , consisting of only eight anti-parallel b-strands ( 59 ) . 
Analysis of the PagL amino acid sequence ( Fig. 9 ) with programs for predicting secondary structure reveals significant b-sheet domains . 
PagL is only one of four outer membrane enzymes characterized to date ( 31 , 60 ) . 
No homologues of the S. typhimurium 3-O-deacylase were found in the nonredundant or unfinished microbial data bases , except in S. typhi and S. paratyphi , although other Gramnegative bacteria are known to contain 3-O-deacylated lipid A species ( 61 , 62 ) . 
A related lipid A lipase activity was previously demonstrated to be present in membranes of the nitrogenfixing bacteria R. leguminosarum and R. etli ( 41 ) , which are known to contain 3-O-deacylated lipid A species ( 63 , 64 ) . 
However , the gene encoding the 3-O-deacylase activity of R. etli is unknown , and the R. etli/leguminosarum enzyme requires divalent cations for activity ( 41 ) , whereas PagL does not . 
Other Gram-negative bacteria that contain partially 3-O-deacylated lipid A include the pathogen P. aeruginosa ( 11 , 61 ) , which also possesses lipid A 3-O-deacylase activity ( 41 ) localized within its outer membrane .2 Structural characterization of the lipid A from Helicobacter pylori by mass spectroscopy ( 65 ) indicates partial deacylation of the 39-O-linked fatty acyl chain . 
Structural studies of lipid A from Porphyromonas gingivalis revealed that both the 3 - and 39-ester-linked fatty acids are partially removed ( 66 ) . 
One would therefore expect additional lipid A lipases to be present in these organisms , but no obvious homologues of PagL were detected by BLASTp or PSI-BLAST searches ( 53 ) in any of these bacteria , suggesting the existence of additional , structurally distinct 3-O-deacylases . 
The key remaining questions about PagL concern its biological function in Salmonella and the significance of its regulation during pathogenesis . 
A systematic study comparing the lipids A of diverse Salmonella strains by mass spectroscopy demonstrated partial absence of the R-3-hydroxymyristate substituent in many cases ( 62 ) . 
Furthermore , small amounts of 3-O-deacylated lipid A species are detected among the lipid A precursors that accumulate in Kdo-deficient , temperature-sen-sitive mutants of S. typhimurium .2 However , PhoP/PhoQ regulation of lipid A deacylation in Salmonella was not observed in previous studies comparing the lipid A structures of wild-type and phoP mutants ( 12 ) , possibly because optimal conditions for inducing the deacylase in cells were not used . 
Unless a low copy pagL-bearing plasmid is introduced into S. typhimurium one does not see significant 3-O-deacylation of lipid A in cells under standard PhoP/PhoQ-activating growth conditions .3 Perhaps additional as yet unknown signals are required for proper functioning of chromosomally encoded PagL . 
We propose that the 3-O-deacylation of lipid A by a bacte-rium that is in the process of infecting an animal might result in a lower or altered immunological response , possibly aiding the bacterium in establishing a prolonged infection . 
It is well known that the presence of the phosphate groups at positions 1 and 49 and the number and type of fatty acyl chains play a critical role in determining the immunological activity of lipid A ( 67 , 68 ) . 
As noted above , the lipid As of H. pylori and P. gingivalis are partially deacylated , and the lipids A of both organisms display significantly lower biological activities relative to other lipid A species ( 65 , 66 ) . 
The characterization of PagL mutants with respect to their pathogenesis and the analysis of various endotoxin-related activities of 3-O-deacylated lipid A species should help to clarify the functions of PagL .
