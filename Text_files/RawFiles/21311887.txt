Abstract Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) is the cause of typhoid fever , a food-borne disease that is pre-valent worldwide , most particularly in developing countries . 
RNA polymerase sigma factors RpoE ( rE ) and RpoS ( rS ) govern transcription initiation of two sets of genes in Esch-erichia and Salmonella . 
It was previously suggested that some genes might be coregulated by RpoE and RpoS in Salmonella under conditions of environmental stress , but experimental evidence has been lacking . 
We therefore constructed rpoS deletion ( DrpoS ) and double rpoE/rpoS deletion ( DrpoE/DrpoS ) mutants of S. Typhi and compared their growth properties with an rpoE mutant ( DrpoE ) and wildtype strains under conditions of hyperosmotic stress . 
We report that the DrpoE , DrpoS , and DrpoE/DrpoS strains grew more slowly under hyperosmotic stress conditions than the wild-type strain , and the DrpoE/DrpoS strain grew most slowly . 
The global transcriptional proﬁles of DrpoE , DrpoS , DrpoE/DrpoS after 30 min of hyperosmotic stress were investigated using a Salmonella genomic DNA microarray . 
The results of microarray indicated that the expression levels of 38 genes were markedly reduced during hyperosmotic stress in the double mutant DrpoE/DrpoS strain , but expression levels were not signiﬁcantly affected by single DrpoE or DrpoS mutations . 
This was conﬁrmed for several key genes by qRT-PCR . 
This study therefore indicated crosstalk between sigma factors RpoE and RpoS in S. Typhi under hyperosmotic conditions and provides new insights into the regulatory networks of S. Typhi . 
Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) is a gramnegative , enteroinvasive pathogen that causes typhoid fever . 
Infection is initiated when Salmonella from contaminated water or food enter the host gastrointestinal tract . 
The bacteria reach the distal ileum and enter the specialized intestinal epithelial M cells of Peyer 's patches . 
After intestinal invasion the pathogen migrates into the mesenteric lymph nodes and survive in macrophages , the bacteria reach the liver , spleen , and bone marrow through the blood and lymph systems , where they replicate to produce systemic infection [ 9 , 17 , 20 ] . 
In the lumen of the host intestine S. Typhi cells are exposed to a signiﬁcant increase in osmolarity : in contaminated water or food the external osmolarity is in the order of 50 mM NaCl , whereas Sal-monella encounter an osmolarity of * 300 mM NaCl in the small intestine [ 19 ] . 
Given the importance of S. Typhi as the causative agent of typhoid it is important to understand the regulation of gene expression in this organism in response to exposure to hyperosmotic environments . 
Hyperosmotic shock is known to activate the expression of both rE and rS-dependent genes in E. coli and S. Typhimurium [ 3 , 14 , 25 ] . 
However , little work has addressed potential overlapping regulation of gene expression by rE and rS in S. Typhi in response to hyperosmotic stress . 
RpoE , a sigma factor rE encoded by the gene rpoE , is an extracytoplasmic factor that initiates transcription of a series of genes and responds to envelope stress [ 27 ] . 
In unstressed conditions , RpoE is repressed by RseA , an antisigma RpoE-binding factor located on the inner membrane of the cell [ 11 ] ; inner-membrane proteases RseP and DegS liberate and activate RpoE by degrading RseA [ 1 , 2 , 28 ] . 
In Salmonella the rpoS gene encodes an alternative sigma factor ( rS/RpoS ) , the regulation of RpoS expression and activity is also complex and as a master regulator required for survival under extreme conditions and for virulence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 5 , 26 ] . 
In a previous genomic microarray analysis of gene expression in S. Typhi we found that rpoE expression was initially decreased following hyperosmotic stress but then increased markedly [ 19 ] . 
Conversely , rpoS expression was elevated immediately after exposure to hyperosmotic stress but expression levels then declined [ 19 ] . 
These results indicate that both RpoE and RpoS were likely to be involved in the regulation of gene expression in S. Typhi under conditions of hyperosmotic stress , there were compensation between RpoE and RpoS . 
The different responses of these two regulatory factors argue that the mechanisms underlying the bacterial response to stress are complex , but it remains unclear how these bacteria adapt to hyperosmotic conditions . 
Microarray analysis is an effective strategy for genome-wide screens of changes in bacterial gene expression , and this approach demonstrated that hyperosmotic stress leads to a marked alternation in the global pattern of gene expression [ 13 , 29 ] . 
However , no studies have so far addressed the possibility that some genes are coregulated by both RpoE and RpoS in S. Typhi under hyperosmotic stress conditions . 
To investigate this possibility we used genomic DNA microarray analysis to study changes in gene expression induced by 30 min exposure of rpoE and rpoS mutant strains to hyperosmotic stress .

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Conditions of Culture
A wild-type z66-antigen positive strain of S. Typhi , GIFU10007 , was used in this study ; the mutants employed in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Bacteria were cultured 37 C in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth with shaking ( 200 rpm ) . 
For low environmental osmolarity the growth medium contained a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mM NaCl . 
To induce hyperosmotic stress , NaCl was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 300 mM and incubation was continued for a further 30 min . 
Construction of the rpoS and rpoE/rpoS Double Deletion Mutant Stains
The rpoS gene deletion mutant ( DrpoS ) was prepared by homologous recombination according to a previously described method [ 8 ] with an rpoS-deletion suicide plasmid lacking 591 bp of the rpoS gene . 
The DrpoE/DrpoS double deletion mutant strain was prepared by electropor-ation of the DrpoS mutant strain with suicide plasmid pGMB151 carrying an rpoE-deletion fragment [ 8 ] . 
The mutant strain was selected by PCR as described previously [ 18 ] , veriﬁed by sequencing , and designated DrpoE/DrpoS . 
Measurement of Bacterial Growth Under Hyperosmotic Stress Conditions
Bacteria from a single colony were inoculated into 1 ml of LB broth containing 50 mM NaCl and cultured overnight at 37 C. Aliquots ( 300 ll ) of this culture were transferred to 30 ml of prewarmed ( 37 C ) fresh LB broth containing 300 mM NaCl . 
Cultures were incubated with shaking ( 200 rpm ) at 37 C for 24 h ; growth was measured using a BioPhotometer ( Eppendorf ) . 
The experiment was repeated three times . 
Wild-type and mutant strains were cultured overnight with shaking at 37 C in LB broth ( pH 7.0 ) containing 50 mM NaCl ( low osmolarity ) . 
After dilution into fresh medium cultures were incubated to exponential growth ( OD 0.5 at 600 nm ) . 
To induce hyperosmotic stress , NaCl was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 300 mM and bacteria were incubated with shaking for a further 30 min at 37 C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit ( mini-column , Qiagen , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and analysis with a ND-1000 spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , USA ) . 
Extracted RNA was treated with 1 U of RNase-free DNase I ( TaKaRa ) at 37 C for 10 min to remove traces of DNA and then incubated at 85 C for 
15 min to inactivate the DNase . 
cDNA probes were synthesized using 20 lg of RNA . 
A genomic DNA microarray designed for S. Typhi was used in this study and ﬂuorescence labeling of cDNA probes , hybridization , and microarray scanning were performed as described previously [ 31 ] . 
Data Analysis
GENEPIX PRO 6.0 ( Molecular Devices ) was used for signal quantiﬁcation . 
The densitometric values of the spots with DNA sequences representing open reading frames ( ORFs ) were normalized to the average overall intensity of the slide in global normalization mode . 
Data were exported into an Excel ( Microsoft Corporation ) spreadsheet for subsequent analysis as described previously [ 31 ] with minor modiﬁcations . 
In brief , the two-channel ﬂuorescent intensity ratios were calculated for each individual spot on each slide ; the average intensity ratio of the same gene from different slides was taken as the mean change in gene expression level . 
This was expressed as log2 ( ratio ) and entered as one datapoint in the gene expression proﬁle plot view . 
Only genes that displayed at least eight valid values in 12 replicate analyses were subject to further analysis . 
Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Assay
Total RNA extracted after 30 min of hyperosmotic stress ( above ) was subjected to qRT-PCR as described previously [ 35 ] . 
The PCR primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 2 . 
Each experiment was performed with four RNA samples from four independent experiments . 
Results and Discussion
Bacterial cells in natural environments often face dramatic environmental changes and have evolved responses to adapt to such changes . 
In response to environmental challenge , enterobacteria such as E. coli or Salmonella can undergo a global programmed modiﬁcation of their patterns of gene expression , leading to increased resistance to stresses such as heat , oxidative agents , or hyperosmotic shock [ 14 , 24 , 34 ] . 
To address the roles of RpoE and RpoS in the regulation of gene expression changes in response to hyperosmotic stress we constructed an DrpoE/DrpoS double mutant strain of S. Typhi . 
When bacteria were grown in standard medium ( LB ) under high osmolarity ( 300 mM NaCl ) it was found that the DrpoE and DrpoS strains grew more slowly than the wild-type control strain , and growth of the double mutant DrpoE/DrpoS strain was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to either of the single mutant strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
However , despite extended lag phases and reduced growth rates , the mutant strains grew to a ﬁnal density comparable to the wild-type , although the density of the DrpoE/DrpoS strain at stationary phase was somewhat below that of the other strains ( Fig. 1 ) . 
While , the growth of mutant strains and the wild-type strain at low osmotic conditions had no such signiﬁcant difference ( data not shown ) . 
These results indicated that both RpoE and RpoS are important for the adaptation of S. Typhi to a hyperosmotic environment . 
The ﬁnding that the growth deﬁcit in the double mutant is greater than in either single mutant argues that RpoE and RpoS are likely to play overlapping roles . 
The osmolarity of the host gut is generally higher than that of food , and high osmolarity could act as a general cue to inform pathogens such as S. Typhi that they are within an appropriate host . 
Activation of RpoE and RpoS in response to high osmolarity is likely to enhance the virulence of S. Typhi by inducing the expression of genes required for bacterial colonization of entry into the host gut and survival within the host . 
Moreover , in a previous genomic microarray analysis of gene expression in S. Typhi under high osmotic stress , we found that the expression of rpoE gradually increases following exposure to stress , whereas rpoS showed the reverse pattern , with initial high levels declining on prolonged exposure [ 19 ] . 
These results indicated potential complementarity between the expression of RpoE and RpoS , raising the possibility that some genes might be coregulated by RpoE and RpoS in Salmonella under hyperosmotic stress . 
However , no genes have yet been identiﬁed that are regulated by both sigma factors under hyperosmotic stress conditions . 
We therefore used a genomic DNA microarray to analyze the global transcriptional proﬁles of the DrpoE , DrpoS , DrpoE/DrpoS and wild-type strains after 30 min of exposure to hyperosmotic stress . 
At this time point , expression levels of rpoS were increased by approximately twofold in the DrpoE mutant , while rpoE expression in the DrpoS mutant strain compared to the wild-type was increased about 1.8-fold . 
The analysis revealed 38 genes whose expression levels were markedly reduced in the DrpoE/DrpoS double mutant strain ( Table 3 ) . 
Importantly , the expression levels of all 38 genes were only weakly affected by either the DrpoE or DrpoS single mutations , suggesting that these genes are likely to be coregulated by RpoE and RpoS . 
To conﬁrm this result , the expression levels of six genes from different operons ( osmC , osmY , otsB , narU , ugpB , and dps ) were analyzed by qRT-PCR . 
This analysis dem-onstrated that the qRT-PCR results were highly consistent with the microarray results ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Both methods showed that the expression of all six genes was barely detectable in the DrpoE/DrpoS double mutant strain following exposure to hyperosmotic conditions , but in all cases there was no signiﬁcant change of expression levels in either the DrpoE or DrpoS single mutant strains . 
This demonstrates that , for all six genes , both RpoE or RpoS are alone sufﬁcient to induce their expression in response to hyperosmotic stress , but that expression is abolished in the absence of both sigma factors . 
To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstration of speciﬁc S. Typhi genes that are coregulated by both RpoE and RpoS during hyperosmotic stress . 
Among the 38 genes , four ( osmC , osmY , osmB , and otsBA ) were previously reported to be regulated by RpoS [ 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 37 ] . 
osmC encodes an envelope protein of unknown function and is a member of the regulon whose expression depends on osmotic pressure in E. coli [ 4 , 10 , 12 ] . 
osmY encodes a periplasmic protein of unknown function and is also known to be osmotically inducible [ 16 ] . 
osmB encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein and is expressed at high levels during osmotic stress and during stationary phase [ 21 ] . 
Genes otsBA encode enzymes that participate in the synthesis of trehalose from UDP glucose and glucose-6-phosphate and are required for osmoregulatory trehalose synthesis [ 6 , 15 , 22 ] ; we previously dem-onstrated that the expression of these genes is strongly increased in S. Typhi under hyperosmotic stress conditions [ 19 ] . 
Changes in these genes expression induced by a hyperosmotic environment are likely to be important to allow Salmonella to successfully invade the epithelium of the host small intestine , and both RpoE and Rpos are likely to contribute to this adaptation . 
In addition , a number of genes involved in cellular metabolism showed RpoE - and RpoS-dependent upregulation in response to hyperosmotic stress . 
These included narUZY , glnHPQ , and ugpBAECQ . 
The narUZY reported are RpoS-regulated , narU gene is involved in nitrite transport and is known to be necessary for the survival of E. coli during severe nutrient starvation [ 33 ] , narZY is necessary for carbon-starvation-inducible thermotolerance and acid tolerance in S. typhimurium [ 32 ] . 
Genes of the glnHPQ operon encode three subunits of the glutamine ABC transporter that permit the uptake of glutamine as a nitrogen source and thereby inﬂuence bacterial growth . 
The ugp operon encodes the transport system for accumulating glycerol-3-phosphate ( G3P ) and ugpB codes for the periplasmic G3P-binding protein . 
G3P can be utilized by E. coli as the sole source of carbon and of phosphate [ 23 , 30 ] and ugp operon mutants failed to grow on both glycerol-2-phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate [ 36 ] . 
Decreased expression of these genes in response to hyperosmotic stress is likely to inﬂuence bacterial growth . 
We previously reported that the expression of those genes was maintained at relatively constant levels following exposure of wild-type S. Typhi to hyperosmotic stress [ 19 ] ; regulation of these metabolic genes by both RpoE and RpoS could explain why single mutant DrpoE and DrpoS strains gave stationary phase densities comparable to that achieved by the wild-type strain but that growth was arrested at a lower cell density in the DrpoE/DrpoS double mutant . 
Other genes whose expression was markedly decreased in the rpoE/DrpoS double mutant included dps ( encoding a DNA starvation/stationary phase protection protein , needed under oxidative but not reported under hyperosmotic stress ) , psiF ( a hypothetical protein gene in Salmonella ) , wrbA [ an NAD ( P ) H : quinone oxidoreductase in E. coli ] , ygaE ( a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator ) , sufC ( a putative ABC transport ATP-binding subunit ) , and some hypothetical proteins genes . 
Further studies will be required to address the roles of these RpoE - and RpoS-coregulated genes in bacterial adaptation to environmental stress .

In summary , we report that both RpoE and RpoS are important for the adaptation of S. Typhi to a hyperosmotic environment , and the presence of either of RpoE or RpoS is required to sustain the growth of S. Typhi under these conditions . 
Genomic microarray analysis revealed that 38 genes , including osmotically inducible genes , metabolic genes , and a DNA protection gene , are coregulated by RpoS and RpoE in S. Typhi during hyperosmotic stress . 
Our results indicate that there is extensive overlap between RpoE and RpoS in S. Typhi under conditions of hyperosmotic stress , a ﬁnding that may help us to understand the regulation of gene expression of S. Typhi in response to enteric hyperosmotic conditions .
