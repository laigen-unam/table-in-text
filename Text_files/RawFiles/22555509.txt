Abstract
The development of RNA interference-based cancer gene therapies has been delayed due to the lack of effective tumor-targeting delivery systems . 
Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) has a natural tropism for solid tumors . 
We report here the use of attenuated S. Typhimurium as a vector to deliver shRNA directly into tumor cells . 
Constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) is a key transcription factor involved in both hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) growth and metastasis . 
In this study , attenuated S. Typhimurium was capable of delivering shRNA-expressing vectors to the targeted cancer cells and inducing RNA interference in vivo . 
More importantly , a single oral dose of attenuated S. Typhimurium carrying shRNA-expressing vectors targeting Stat3 induced remarkably delayed and reduced HCC ( in 70 % of mice ) . 
Cancer in these cured mice did not recur over 2 years following treatment . 
These data demonstrated that RNA interference combined with Salmonella as a delivery system may offer a novel clinical approach for cancer gene therapy .

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the sixth most common cancer in the world ,1 and the prognosis is poor because of rapid tumor progression and recurrence .2 It is characterized as an inherently chemotherapy-resistant cancer and there are no well-established effective systemic therapies until now .3 Currently , several signaling pathways critical for HCC pathogenesis have been recognized , such as the Ras/Raf/MEK / ERK pathway and PI3K/Akt / mTOR pathway ,4,5 and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) signaling pathway is reported to have a key role in HCC growth and metastasis .6 Thus , targeting this pathway may lead to an effective treatment to HCC . 
RNA interference is a powerful research tool for cancer gene silencing .7 However , a key obstacle to the development of RNA interference-based cancer gene therapies is targeted delivery to cancer cells .8 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) has a natural tropism , not only for solid tumors but also for metastatic lesions in mice , and accumulates at greater than 10 000 times more in the tumor tissues than normal tissues .9 We have previously employed a delivery system involving attenuated S. Typhimurium combined with silencing shRNA expression plasmids as a therapeutic treatment for prostate cancer .10 As the liver and spleen are natural targets of S. Typhimurium in mice after oral ingestion ,11 we hypothesized that attenuated S. Typhimurium carrying Stat3-shRNA-expressing vectors will be effective in treating HCC . 
Our results indicate that a single dose of attenuated S. Typhimurium expressing Stat3-shRNA effects a synergistic suppression of both HCC growth , metastases and elicits multi-component antitumor immunity . 
Most significantly , HCC was eradicated from 70 % of mice and did not recur within 2 years following treatment .

In all , 0.2 ml ( 1 × 108 per ml ) H22 cell solution was subcutaneously inoculated to form ectopic transplanted model in mice to form a solid tumor . 
After 10 days , when tumors of 3 -- 5 mm in diameter formed in the right groin of these mice , they were removed and sheared into small pieces of 1 mm3 under sterile conditions . 
C57BL6 mice were anesthetized by coelio-injection of Pentobarbitone ( 70 mg kg − 1 ) and laparotomy was performed . 
Under sterile conditions the right lobes of liver were punctured to form a 3-mm-long sinus tract and a small piece of tumor tissue was put into each sinus tract , and the orthotopic transplantation tumor model of HCC was established . 
Tumor , liver , spleen , heart and lung tissues from control or bacterially treated mice were excised , weighed and homogenized . 
The diluted tissue homogenates were observed by flow cytometry . 
Green fluorescence was observed in bacterially infected cells . 
A portion of each tissue was also prepared for transmission electron microscopic analysis to determine the extent of bacterial infection .

Mouse splenic lymphocytes ( 5 × 105cells per 100 μl per well ) were incubated in the absence or presence of ConA ( 5 mg ml − 1 ) in a 96-well plate in triplicate for 72 h . 
In all , 20 μl MTT ( 5 mg ml − 1 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was added and cells were cultured for additional 4 h. Subsequently , cells were lysed using dimethylsulfoxide ( 150 μl per well , Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL , USA ) . 
When the formanzan crystals were completely dissolved , the optical density ( OD ) was measured at 490 nm using a enzyme micro-plate reader ( Microplate Reader Model 550 , Bio-Rad , Shanghai , China ) . 
The stimulation index ( SI ) was calculated according to the following formula :

Localization of Salmonella in tumor and other tissues 
Following oral administration , the accumulation of attenuated S. Typhimurium was evaluated in various tissues at specified times by flow cytometry . 
Some levels of GFP expression could be detected in all tissues . 
Figure 1a shows that at 24 h after inoculation attenuated Salmonella accumulated predominantly in the liver , spleen and the H22 tumor , but was also detected in the heart , lung and kidneys . 
The number of bacteria increased in the tumor and the liver and decreased in the spleen at 5 and 10 days after administration . 
By day 30 , the number of attenuated S. Typhimurium in the tumor remained significantly higher than other tissues . 
Figure 1b shows that the GFP-expressed bacterial distributions in tumor tissues were noticeably stronger than in normal liver tissues at day 30 , around 13.7-fold .

Localization of Salmonella in tumor and other tissues 
TEM analyses within tumor cells revealed attenuated S. Typhimurium in the intercellular spaces in tumors and in tumor-associated macrophages . 
These results indicate that attenuated S. Typhimurium can specifically home to tumor cells , possibly via tumor-associated macrophages . 
Inhibition of orthotopically transplanted liver tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by therapeutic treatment of bacterially delivered shRNAs 
In order to evaluate the antitumor ability of recombinant S. Typhimurium , we employed a C57BL6 mouse orthotopic liver tumor implant model . 
Fifteen days after tumor implantation , mice were divided into four groups ( n = 10 per group ) and then injected with 1 × 107 cfu of attenuated S. Typhimurium carrying different plasmids via orogastric inoculation . 
Twenty days after bacterial inoculation , mice were sacrificed , and the tumors were excised , weighed and measured . 
As shown in Table 2 , mice treated with buffer alone ( mock control ) developed primary tumors with a mean volume of 2274.09 ± 1735.17 mm3 . 
In mice treated with Salmonella-Si-scramble , tumors grew to a volume of 551.98 ± 367.01 mm3 , similar to the tumor volume of mice treated with S. Typhimurium without any plasmid . 
However , mice treated with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 developed tumors with a median reduced volume of 301.99 ± 390.16 mm3 and showed marked tumor growth suppression compared with the Salmonella-Si-scramble or Salmonella alone ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Remarkably , tumors completely disappeared in 70 % of mice in this group over 20 days ( Figures 2a -- c ) . 
Observation of metastases of implanted tumors revealed that in the animals treated with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 , intraceliac seeding , bloody ascites and lung metastases were all significantly decreased compared with buffer alone-treated mice ( Table 2 ) . 
These data directly demonstrate that the attenuated Salmonella expressing a Stat3-specific siRNA exerts a strong antitumor and anti-metastasis effect . 
To further demonstrate the therapeutic utility of Salmonella-delivered shRNAs , tumorbearing mice were orally administered S. Typhimurium carrying various plasmids or buffer . 
Mice were observed for 2 years . 
As shown in Figure 2d , all mice ( n = 10 ) injected with buffer were dead before 40 days . 
In contrast , the mice treated with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 and Salmonella-Si-Scramble significantly extended mean survival times and had seven and four surviving mice at 2 years without tumor recurrence , respectively . 
Thus , therapeutic treatment with bacterially delivered shRNAs significantly prolong the survival time of H22 tumor mice . 
f Stat3-downstream targeted genes by Salmonella-delivered shRNAs As Stat3 significantly regulates H22 tumor growth and metastases , we next examined the expression of Stat3-downstream targeted genes by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR , western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses . 
Following Salmonella-Si-Stat3 treatment , antiapoptotic Bcl-2 , inducers of tumor angiogenesis VEGF and a master regulator for surviving hypoxia of carcinoma HIF-1 mRNAs and proteins were reduced and cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 , and c-Myc were also diminished ( Figure 5 ) . 
Ki-67 ( a cell division -- associated antigen ) and MMP-2 , known to promote metastasis , were also suppressed by treatment with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 compared with the Si-Scramble control ( Figure 4d ) . 
Caspase-3 , a key mediator of apoptosis , stained significantly stronger in the Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group than scrambled vector ( Figure 4b ) . 
These results show that Salmonella-Si-Stat3 inhibits the expression of Stat3 and Stat3-regulated genes , and results in a stronger suppression of tumor proliferation via apoptosis and metastases inhibition .

cific reduction of Stat3 expression by Salmonella-delivered siRNAs in orthotopic liver or implants A reduction of Stat3 mRNA and protein was observed by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses 15 days after bacterial inoculation . 
Administration of Salmonella-Si-Stat3 reduced the Stat3 mRNA level to 30 % of the Salmonella-Si-Scramble ( Figures 3a and b ) . 
Western blotting analyses with native Stat3 ( Stat3 ) - and phosphorylated Tyr705 Stat3 ( p-Stat3 ) - specific antibodies also showed a strong inhibition of p-Stat3 or Stat3 proteins to 18 % or 5 % , respectively , following treatment with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 ( Figure 3c and d ) compared with Salmonella-Si-Scramble . 
Immunohistochemical analyses for Stat3 expression in the H22 tumors treated with buffer or Salmonella-Si-Scramble were highly positive for Stat3 . 
In contrast , H22 tumor cells treated with Salmonella-Si-Stat3 stained weakly for Stat3 ( Figure 4b ) . 
Therefore , the expression of Stat3 and p-Stat3 is specifically knocked down by Salmonella-delivered Si-Stat3 .

- delivered Stat3 siRNAs enhanced NK cells activity of tumor-beared mouse 
To determine the impact for NK cells in vivo by Salmonella-Si-Stat3 , we measured the antitumor activity by NK cytotoxicity assay . 
As a result , the NK cell activity of Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group at the E : T ratio 25:1 , 50:1 and 100:1 was 47.7 % , 70.5 % and 71.9 % , respectively ( Figure 6a ) . 
The NK cell activity for Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group was significantly higher than that of mock group ( P < 0.05 ) . 
As shown by flow cytometry for the expression of activation markers , treatment with the Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group significantly upregulates the number of NK cells in comparison with the mock group ( Figure 6b ) . 
On days 21 of treatment , MTT assay was performed to evaluate the lymphocyte proliferation induced by Con A . 
The results indicate that both Salmonella-Si-scramble or Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group had no obvious influence on splenic lymphocyte proliferation at the concentration of 5 μg ml − 1 Con A , but lymphocyte proliferation was elevated when stimulated with the concentration of 10 μg ml − 1 Con A. However , the stimulation index ( SI ) was significantly increased in Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group with the concentration of 20 μg ml − 1 Con A compared to the control group ( Figure 6c ) ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Moreover , the CD3 + / CD8 + T cells were further analyzed for three-color flow cytometry . 
The results showed that the percentage of CD8 + T cells were successively increased by Salmonella-Si-Stat3-treated mice ( Figure 6d ) . 
As eradication of tumors , is thought to be inhibited by T-regulatory ( Treg ) cells , we examined whether Stat3 deficiency might affect Treg cells . 
Indeed , the proportions of CD4 + T cells expressing Treg markers ( CD25 and Foxp3 ) in the Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group were considerably reduced ( Figures 6e and f ) , which account for approximately 30 and 60 % of the mock group separately . 
Changes in Treg cells might be the result of Stat3 deficiency in T cells or indirect effects influenced by Stat3 signaling in other immune cells .

DISCUSSION
RNA interference therapy has recently been used successfully to knock down abnormally upregulated specific cancer gene expression .16,17 In addition , challenge to the practical application of RNA interference therapy in human tumors is to define a targeted method of siRNA delivery specifically to reach the cytoplasm of cancer cells .8,18 Systemic delivery systems such as retrovirus or adenovirus can target tumor cells well , but are limited to research use in animal models due to human safety issues .19,20 Certain bacteria have great potential as siRNA delivery vectors and have already been employed in animals and humans .21 -- 23 S. Typhimurium is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that mainly invades mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue through M cells in the intestinal mucosa and is phagocytized by macrophages and dendritic cells , in which the bacteria can proliferate .24 Besides infecting macrophages and dendritic cells , attenuated S. Typhimurium , which are facultative anaerobic , have a remarkable tumor-targeting capacity and have been reported to accumulate > 1000-fold greater in tumors than other tissues .25 Attenuated S. Typhimurium that carry eukaryotic expression vectors can be used for genetic immunization via the oral route .26 Attenuated bacteria infect target cells and disrupt after limited proliferation cycles . 
Antigen-expressing plasmids in the bacterium can be subsequently released into the cytoplasm of the host cell , where they direct expression of the proteins they encode , thus inducing an immune response .27 Our results showed that S. Typhimurium could carry the shRNAs accumulated predominantly in the H22 tumors and effect target gene expression effectively in vivo . 
HCC is considered to be a hypervascularized tumor and its progression is closely related to angiogenesis .28 Recent studies have shown that both HIF-1α and VEGF are involved in the malignant transformation of hepatocytes and have an important role at the stage of hepatocarcinogenesis .29 -- 31 In addition , Stat3 , an inducer of angiogenesis in terms of upregulating VEGF and HIF-1α ,32 was found to be persistently activated in primary human HCCs33 ,34 and appears to have a central role in tumor genesis , this transcription factor is implicated in both oncogenesis and metastasis .6,34,35 In this study , we found that Stat3 has a key role in promoting HCC proliferation and metastasis in vivo . 
Using the Salmonella-delivered shRNAs therapy , our results showed that downregulation of Stat3 powerfully suppresses the growth of H22 tumors and substantially prolongs the survival time of mice by inducing apoptosis and G1 phase arrest . 
The therapeutic mechanism is due to the inhibition of Stat3 expression with a coordinated reduction of Stat3-downstream genes in this biopathway . 
HIF-1α was dramatically reduced by Stat3-shRNA , which resulted in lower VEGF mRNA and protein expression ( P < 0.01 ) . 
In addition , the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 , cell cycle regulators Cyclin D1 and c-Myc were significantly inhibited in Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group compared with the control group . 
Furthermore , MMP2 , which contains a promoter region that directly binds by activated Stat336 and has been implicated in HCC ,37 is also decreased after Stat3 expression is blocked . 
Reduction of this multiple proteins results in inhibition of H22 tumor metastasis . 
The disturbances of cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis are also found on specific signal-transduction pathways within the tumor cells . 
Besides , the immune system had an important part in it .38 In our hepatocarcinoma model , treatment with Salmonella-delivered Stat3 shRNAs affected multiple immune cells , many of which show enhanced antitumor activity . 
As innate immunity has an active role in immune surveillance as well as 
References 
induced antitumor effects , we investigated whether blocking Stat3 might affect NK cell numbers and their ability to kill target cells . 
Our finding revealed that the expression and activity of NK cells were greatly improved on day 7 after treated . 
Additional experiments further assessed the function and expression of T lymphocytes , and our analysis indicated that treatment of Salmonella-Si-Stat3 group enhance successively the percentage of CD8 + - positive cells , decrease the number of CD4 + - positive T cells , and reverse the CD4 + / CD8 + ratio . 
Tumor cells adapt many always to escape immune surveillance , resulting in immune tolerance to the tumor . 
CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells ( Treg ) have a crucial role in maintaining self-tolerance in hosts by suppressing a wide variety of immune responses . 
CD4 + CD25 + Treg populations , originally found to suppress autoimmune responses , are also crucial in controlling antitumor immune responses . 
We also found a significantly lower number of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + TTreg cells in the treated group as compared with the mock group . 
The present study demonstrates that attenuated S. Typhimurium can introduce siRNA expression plasmids into H22 tumors , significantly suppressing Stat3 gene expression and effectively reducing tumor growth and metastasis . 
In addition , elevated NK cell activity , upregulation of CD8 + T lymphocytes and suppression of Treg cells are partly responsible for the synergistic antitumor effects . 
These results further demonstrated the ability of attenuated S. Typhimurium to serve as an effective tumor targeting delivery vector for siRNA and provides insight into design of a new therapeutic strategy to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in HCC patients . 
Finally , a single dose of Salmonella-vectored siRNA-Stat3 has revealed in 70 % cure rate for orthotopically implanted HCC , which did not recur for an extended 2 years following . 
These findings offer increased hope that these strategies can be applied to few cancer treatments in humans .
