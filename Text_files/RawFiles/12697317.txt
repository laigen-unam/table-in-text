Abstract 
We studied the effects of Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on in vivo cytokine mRNA levels in chickens , and investigated whether these levels could be altered by different nutrients . 
Two hundred and forty chicks were assigned in a 2 # 4 factorial design of treatments . 
Factors were intravenous injection with S. typhimurium LPS , or saline ( control ) , and four dietary fat sources : corn oil ( CO ) , linseed oil ( LO ) , menhaden oil and beef tallow ( BT ) . 
Two hours after injection birds were killed and their spleens removed for RNA extraction . 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays for mRNA of chicken IFN-g , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-15 , IL-18 and 28S rRNA were used to obtain the in vivo splenic cytokine proﬁles . 
Expression levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA increased , but IL-15 mRNA decreased 2 h after challenge with LPS compared with saline controls . 
In saline-injected control chickens , the dietary oil source did not affect the splenic mRNA level of any cytokine . 
In LPS challenged chickens IFN-g mRNA was signiﬁcantly higher in the chickens fed the ﬁsh oil enriched diet compared with the LO , CO and BT enriched diets . 
The present data imply that avian IL-15 has , at least partially , a different function compared to its mammalian counterpart , and in addition , chicken innate immune responses might be affected differently by n 2 3 PUFA compared to mammals .

1. Introduction
Numerous studies have demonstrated the immu-nomodulatory properties of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) [ 1,2 ] in a species speciﬁc manner . 
Dietary n 2 3 PUFA decreased interleukin ( IL ) -1 - b , IL-2 , IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with control diets low in n 2 3 PUFA and not particularly high in n 2 6 PUFA . 
In mice , dietary n 2 3 PUFA increased IL-1-b and TNF-a in peritoneal macrophages compared with diets low in n 2 3 PUFA and high in n 2 6 PUFA . 
During the early stage of an infectious challenge with Listeria monocytogenes , circulating IL-12 and interferon ( IFN ) - g levels , and splenic IFN-g mRNA were lower in mice fed an n 2 3 PUFA enriched diet compared with an n 2 6 PUFA enriched and low PUFA diet [ 3 ] . 
This observation indicates a shift from a T helper ( Th ) -1 type to a Th-2 type of immune response . 
The mechanisms by which dietary fatty acids modulate cytokine production have not yet been fully elucidated . 
One widespread concept is that long-chain dietary n 2 3 PUFA are incorporated into cell membrane phospholipids replacing arachidonic acid as a substrate , and then are converted into prostaglandin ( PG ) E3 and leukotriene B5 which are biologically less active than arachidonic acid metabolites PGE2 and leukotriene B4 . 
Moreover , n 2 3 PUFA have been shown to be poorly metabolized by cyclooxygen-ase , thereby reducing the total production of eicosanoids [ 4 ] . 
In rats dietary ﬁsh oil lowers the production of PGE2 by peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes by 70 -- 80 % compared with dietary corn oil ( CO ) [ 5 ] . 
Also , in mice it was demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits the production of IL-2 and IFN-g [ 6 ] . 
These data suggest that PGE2 mediates the effects of dietary n 2 3 PUFA on the level of Th-1 cytokines . 
In avian species several studies have demonstrated effects of dietary PUFA on immune cell function [ 7 -- 11 ] . 
However , these studies are inconsistent . 
Research in Aves has usually not investigated regulatory mechanisms , though one study suggests that the anti-inﬂamma-tory properties of n 2 3 PUFA are associated with its metabolic function as an eicosanoid precursor [ 12 ] . 
Information on effects of PUFAs on cytokine proﬁles in poultry is lacking . 
The detection of avian cytokines at the protein level is hampered by the absence of speciﬁc antibodies . 
Recently several avian cytokines have been cloned and sequenced , and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assays for avian cytokines were developed [ 13 -- 15 ] . 
The present study was designed to quantify the in vivo level of cytokine expression in poultry after S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation , and to investigate whether differences in these levels , caused by nutrients , could be detected . 
Previously , we reported such effects using semiquantitative RT-PCR on the expression of splenic mRNA of IL-1-b , IL-2 , IFN-g , myelomonocytic growth factor ( MGF ) and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - b [ 16 ] . 
We detected increased in vivo expression of IL-1-b , IL-2 , IFN-g and MGF following LPS challenge , and increased IL-2 mRNA in LPS-challenged chickens fed a diet rich in long-chain n 2 3 PUFA compared with other LPS-challenged chickens . 
Since this study , more quantitative and repeatable techniques , such as real-time RT-PCR , have been developed and are expected to be more useful for discriminating small , physiological changes in message expression due to dietary changes . 
In this paper , quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays were used to obtain more quantitative in vivo cytokine proﬁles for IFN-g , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-15 and IL-18 in the same samples as described previously [ 16 ] .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chickens, housing and experimental design
The birds , their housing , and the design used in the present study have previously been extensively described [ 16 ] . 
Brieﬂy , in a 4 # 2 factorial arrangement of treatments , with diet and immunisation as factors , 240 4-day old male chicks were distributed among 48 battery pens . 
To a 95 % constant basal diet , 5 % of one of the oil fractions , CO , linseed oil ( LO ) , ﬁsh ( menhaden ) oil ( FO ) or beef tallow ( BT ) , was added . 
The diets met or exceeded the minimum requirements for a growing layer strain [ 17 ] and were supplied ad libitum . 
Feed intake , body weight gain and feed conversion per pen were established and were not affected by the oil source . 
At 37 or 38 day of age the birds were injected intravenous with either 1 mg Salmonella typhimurium LPS ( Sigma , St Louis , MO in 1 ml 0.9 % saline , or with 1 ml 0.9 % saline as a control . 
A dose of 1 mg LPS was used because this dose was effective in enhancing splenic cytokine mRNA levels compared with untreated birds . 
Eight pens were assigned per LPS treatment , and four pens were assigned per saline control treatment because of no response , and thus a small variance , was expected in control birds . 
A preliminary study indicated that the present immunisation treatment showed a higher IL-1-b , IL-2 , IFN-g response at 2 h after injection compared to 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 16 , and 24 h after injection . 
Therefore at 2 h after injection four cockerels per pen were euthanised by cervical dislocation , and spleens freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 70 8C for subsequent RNA extraction . 
2.2. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total splenic RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate -- phenol procedure [ 18 ] . 
Puriﬁed RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and the yield of total RNA obtained from each individual chick was determined spectrophotometrically at 
260 nm . 
Equal amounts of RNA from each cockerel of the same pen were pooled ðn 1/4 4Þ to form one sample per experimental unit ( pen ) of 0.2 mg of single stranded RNA/ml and stored at 2 70 8C . 
Cytokine mRNA levels in chicken spleens were quantiﬁed using a method based on that of Moody et al. [ 19 ] as described by Kaiser et al. [ 15 ] . 
Brieﬂy , cytokine and 28S rRNA-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation primers and probes were designed using the Primer Express software program ( PE Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . 
Details of probes and primers are given in Table 1 . 
All cytokine probes were designed , from the sequence of the relevant genes , to lie across intron -- exon boundaries . 
Cytokine probes were labeled with the ﬂuorescent reporter dye 5-carboxyﬂuorescein ( FAM ) at the 5 end and the 0 quencher N , N , N , N - tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine 0 0 ( TAMRA ) at the 3 end . 
The 28S probe was labeled 0 with the ﬂuorescent reporter dye VIC ( PE Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) at the 5 end and 0 TAMRA at the 3 end . 
0 RT-PCR was performed using the Taqman EZ RT-PCR kit ( PE Applied Biosystems , Foster City ,

The RT-PCR mixture consisted of 1 # EZ RT-PCR buffer [ including 60 nM 6-carboxy-x-rhoda-mine ( a ﬂuorescent reference dye ) ] , 3 mM manganese acetate , 300 mM dATP , dCTP , and dGTP , 600 mM dUTP , 600 nM each primer , 100 nM probe , 0.1 U rTth polymerase , 0.01 U AmpErase UNG ( uracil-N-glyco-sylase ) , 5 ml 10 # diluted total RNA , made up to 25 ml with RNase-free water . 
Ampliﬁcation and detection of speciﬁc products were performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System ( PE Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) with the following cycle proﬁle : 1 cycle of 50 8C for 2 min , 96 8C for 5 min , 60 8C for 30 min and 95 8C for 5 min , and 40 cycles of 94 8C for 20 s , 59 8C for 1 min . 
Quantiﬁcation was based on the increased ﬂuor-escence detected by the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence

Detection System due to hydrolysis of the targetspeciﬁc probes by the 5 nuclease activity of the rTth 0 DNA polymerase during PCR ampliﬁcation . 
The passive reference dye 6-carboxy-x-rhodamine , which was not involved in ampliﬁcation , was used to correct ﬂuorescent ﬂuctuations resulting from changes in the reaction conditions , for normalisation of the reporter signal . 
Results are expressed in terms of the threshold cycle value ðCtÞ ; the cycle at which the change in the reporter dye ðDRnÞ passes the signiﬁcance threshold . 
In this work , the threshold values of DRn are shown in Table 2 for all reactions described . 
To generate standard curves for the cytokine and 28S rRNA speciﬁc reactions , total RNA extracted from stimulated splenocytes was serially diluted from 
10 to 10 . 
Each RT-PCR experiment contained 21 25 three no-template-controls , triplicates of 24 test samples and a log10 dilution series . 
Regression analysis of the mean values of two replicate RTPCRs was used to generate standard curves and to calculate the slopes of the 28S rRNA and cytokine mRNA log10 dilution series . 
To correct for differences between RNA levels between samples within the experiment , ﬁrst the Difference Factor for each sample was calculated by dividing the mean Ct value for 28S rRNA-speciﬁc product of a sample by the mean Ct value for 28S rRNA-speciﬁc product from all samples . 
Second , the corrected cytokine mRNA per sample was calculated using the following formula : 
To calculate the fold changes per sample the following formula was used : fold change sample 1/4 1/2 ðcorrected cytokine mRNA sample 2 basal mRNA level cytokineÞ # 10 = 
cytokine slope 
Basal levels were deﬁned as the average corrected cytokine mRNA of all saline injected control chickens apart from two samples that were considered as being outliers ( Section 3 ) . 
These two outliers were not excluded from the statistical analysis .

In order to test for the presence of an LPS effect and interaction between LPS challenge and dietary oil source , corrected cytokine mRNA values were analysed by two-way ANOVA . 
To test for the presence of diet effects within the LPS-challenged treatments and the saline controls , corrected cytokine mRNA levels were analysed by one-way ANOVA within control and LPS treatments . 
The variance in the saline injected treatments was different from the variance in the LPS-immunised treatments , and therefore the cytokine expression data were considered as two different normal distributions . 
All analyses were performed using the General Linear Model procedure of the SAS software [ 20 ] . 
The probability level ðPÞ of , 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant . 
3. Results
Further data analysis indicated that this was largely attributable to two outliers in these treatments . 
In LPS-challenged chickens , a diet effect was found for IFN-g mRNA ðP , 0:05 Þ ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Numerically , the level of IFN-g mRNA was highest in the chickens fed the FO enriched diet , followed by the chickens fed the LO , LO and BT enriched diet , respectively . 
Post hoc analysis indicated that the IFN-g mRNA levels of the chickens fed FO , as well as the pooled IFN-g mRNA levels of the chickens fed n 2 3 PUFA enriched diets ( ﬁsh - and linseed-oil ) , were signiﬁcantly higher compared with IFN-g mRNA levels in the other dietary treatments ðP , 0:05 Þ : IL-8 mRNA levels were also higher ( though not signiﬁcantly , P 1/4 0:13 Þ in LPS-injected chicks fed the FO diet compared to LPS-injected chicks fed the CO , LO and BT diets . 
In the LPS-injected birds , the IFN-g and IL-8 mRNA levels in chicks fed the diet enriched with FO are 20.2 and 11.2 fold higher , respectively compared to basal levels . 
These IFN-g and IL-8 mRNA levels after FO enrichment correspond with 1.5 and 0.8 times the basal level higher mRNA levels than pooled IFN-g and IL-8 mRNA levels of the other LPS-injected chicks .

4. Discussion
The cytokine responses to S. typhimurium in chickens are poorly described and their role in the pathogenesis of such infections have not yet been extensively studied . 
In this study , we investigated whether in vivo differences in cytokine mRNA were detectable , how they were affected by LPS challenge , as a model innate immune response against a prototypic Salmonella infection , and whether modulation of these levels by the dietary fat source could be detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR . 
Mammalian IL-15 is a monocyte-derived cytokine that shares many biological activities with IL-2 , such as the induction of T cell and natural killer ( NK ) cell proliferation and the co-stimulation of B cells for growth and immunoglobulin synthesis , as a consequence of their co-utilisation of the b and g chains of the IL-2R . 
Differences in IL-15 and IL-2 activities are presumably due to differential expression of their speciﬁc receptor a chains . 
The major function of IL-15 production by macro-phages is support of innate immunity , e.g. selective activation of NK cells [ 21 ] . 
Interleukin-15 may promote NK cell activity during innate immune responses before the activation of T lymphocytes and subsequent production of IL-2 . 
IL-15 substitutes for IL-2 through its use of the IL-2R b and g chains in promoting NK cell proliferation and as a costimulus for IL-12-dependent secretion of IFN-g by NK cells [ 22 ] . 
As IL-15 is produced by macrophages followin stimulation with bacterial components in vitro , it has been proposed to have a role in the early innate proinﬂammatory response to infection [ 23 ] . 
Several studies indicate that IL-15 mRNA expression in human monocytes [ 22,24 ] is elevated within 5 and 12 h after stimulation with LPS . 
According to Kirman and Nielsen [ 25 ] , LPS induces a non-speciﬁc production of this cytokine by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . 
The chicken homologue of IL-15 has recently been cloned and characterized [ 26 ] . 
The present observation that chicken IL-15 mRNA was ﬁve fold lower at 2 h after LPS stimulation seems in contrast with the important role of IL-15 in innate immunity , because at the same time IFN-g mRN levels were 18 fold higher . 
Several causes may underlie this seeming discrepancy . 
IL-15 mRNA expression might have been elevated in other tissues such as in endothelial cells and non-lymphoid stromal cells . 
In mice , IL-15 has an important role in the early activity of gd T cells and IFN-g production by these cells in response to infection with Salmonella [ 27 ] . 
In addition , it has been suggested that physiological delivery of IL-15 to memory T lymphocytes predominantly occurs on lymphoid stroma [ 28 ] . 
The decrease of splenic IL-15 mRNA after LPS injection might be the result of selective LPS-induced apoptosis of splenic IL-15-expressing macrophages . 
It is speculated that the increased IFN-g expression at 2 h after LPS challenge is most probably from innate immune cells such as NK cells or CD8 þ T cells , as IFN-g derived from T cells after a stimulus would probably require more time . 
The possibility that the gene identiﬁed as chicken IL-15 may be functionally different from mammalian IL-15 with regard to its role in innate immunity implies that other co-stimulatory factors induced the increased IFN-g mRNA levels . 
In mice , IL-18 has been found to be a powerful costimulatory factor for the synthesis of IL-12-driven IFN-g gene transcription in NK cells [ 29 ] . 
The 12 fold higher IL-18 expression observed in the present study might also be associated with increased IFN-g transcription . 
Previously we reported elevated levels of IL-1-b , IL-2 , MGF and IFN-g expression after LPS injection , with the exception that IFN-g was not changed in LPS-challenged chicks fed FO [ 16 ] . 
These data were obtained by end-point-analysis of semi-quantitiative RT-PCR and cytokine mRNA level expressed relative to b-actin mRNA levels . 
We assume that the present data are more accurate because the currently used real-time RT-PCR assays are more quantitative than the previously used assays , and therefore , that the diet effect on IFN-g is now realistically estimated . 
Studies in humans suggest that n 2 3 PUFA consumption reduces the production of phagocyte-derived proinﬂammatory cytokines TNF-a , IL-1-b , IL-6 , and T-cell-derived IL-2 , IL-12 and IFN-g [ 1,3 ] . 
The current observation of increased IFN-g mRNA levels in chickens fed FO diet seems inconsistent with this . 
In mice , increases in IFN-g protein production following dietary FO enrichment have been reported [ 30 ] . 
We did not observe any other statistically signiﬁcant alteration in cytokine mRNA as a result of diets . 
No difference in levels of IL-18 mRNA , a potent stimulator of IFN-g production [ 31 ] , was observed . 
Possibly most of the increased IFN-g transcription was induced by IL-18 , and the extra IFN-g mRNA in the chickens fed FO diet was related to differences in the levels of eicosanoids , e.g. prostaglandin E2 , in the presence of stimulated NK cells producing IFN-g mRNA . 
In chickens , dietary PUFA can alter the release of PGE in stimulated splenocytes [ 32 ] . 
Prostaglandin E2 inhibited iNOS activity in mouse macrophages [ 33 ] . 
IFN-g may support protective innate immunity against salmonellosis in chickens [ 34 ] . 
Maximal avian macrophage iNOS activity is induced by a combination of IFN-g and LPS [ 35,36 ] . 
Because NO acts as an innate immune effector molecule , dietary FO might enhance chicken innate immunity . 
Previously we found that n 2 3 PUFA , as compared with n 2 6 , PUFA elevated antibody responses against Mycobacterium butyricum protein and that n 2 6 and n 2 3 PUFA effects are interactive , with minimal amounts of n 2 3 PUFA being essential for optimal antibody responses [ 37 ] . 
Together , these data indicate that n 2 3 PUFA in chickens enhance both innate and adaptive immunity , depending on the stage of the immune response and the presence of other immunomodulating nutrients , e.g. n 2 6 PUFA . 
In summary , chickens may react differently compared to mammals in two ways . 
First , LPS stimulation inhibits the expression of chicken IL-15 mRNA , whereas in mammals increased IL-15 mRNA levels are found . 
This implies that avian IL-15 has , at least partially , a different function compared to its mammalian counterpart . 
Second , the n 2 3 PUFA increased mRNA expression of IFN-g in LPS-stimulated chickens indicates that the innate response can be modulated in Aves , albeit differently compared to mammals . 
Fig. 1 shows the standardised data for cytokine levels expressed as fold changes in mRNA levels compared to basal mRNA levels . 
The mean mRNA levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-18 and IFN-g of all diets pooled together increased by 29.2 , 10.4 , 12.2 and 18.7 fold compared with basal levels , respectively , ( all P , 0:0001 Þ 2 h following LPS injection . 
Inter-leukin-15 mRNA of all diets pooled together decreased by 5.1 fold compared with basal levels at 2 h following LPS injection . 
In saline-injected control animals , the dietary oil source did not signiﬁcantly affect the splenic mRNA level of any cytokine . 
However , Fig. 1 indicates that in the saline-injected controls , mRNA levels of all cytokines , except IL-15 , are consistently higher in the CO and LO treatments compared with the FO and BT treatments . 
Also the SE values are much larger in these treatments .
