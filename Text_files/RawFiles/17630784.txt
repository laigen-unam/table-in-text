ABSTRACT : Tricarballylate , a citrate analogue , is considered the causative agent of grass tetany , a ruminant disease characterized by acute magnesium deficiency . 
Although the normal rumen flora can not catabolize tricarballylate , the Gram-negative enterobacterium Salmonella enterica can . 
An operon dedicated to tricarballylate utilization ( tcuABC ) present in this organism encodes all functions required for tricarballylate catabolism . 
Tricarballylate is converted to the cis-aconitate in a single oxidative step catalyzed by the FAD-dependent tricarballylate dehydrogenase ( TcuA ) enzyme . 
We hypothesized that the uncharacterized TcuB protein was required to reoxidize the flavin cofactor in ViVo . 
Here , we report the initial biochemical characterization of TcuB . 
TcuB is associated with the cell membrane and contains two 4Fe-4S clusters and heme . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteinyl residues putatively required as ligands of the 4Fe-4S clusters completely inactivated TcuB function . 
TcuB greatly increased the Vmax of the TcuA reaction from 69 ( 2 to 8200 ( 470 nmol min-1 mg-1 ; the Km of TcuA for tricarballylate was unaffected . 
Inhibition of TcuB activity by an inhibitor of ubiquinone oxidation , 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isoproylbenzoquinone ( DBMIB ) , implicated the quinone pool as the ultimate acceptor of electrons from FADH2 . 
We propose a model for the electron flow from FADH2 , to the 4Fe-4S clusters , to the heme , and finally to the quinone pool . 
Tricarballylate , a citrate analogue , is considered the causative agent of grass tetany , a ruminant disease characterized by acute magnesium deficiency ( 1 ) . 
Previous reports have found a strong correlation between the accumulation of trans-aconitate in the rumen and the incidence of the disease ( 2 ) . 
In the rumen , trans-aconitate is rapidly reduced to tricarballylate ( 3 ) , leading to Mg ( II ) ion chelation and excretion , and inhibition of aconitase ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) . 
Neither the ruminant nor the normal rumen flora can catabolize tricarballylate . 
However , it was previously reported that Salmonella enterica serovar Tymphimurium strain LT2 ( hereafter referred to as S. enterica ) can utilize tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source ( 6 ) . 
Four genes in this bacterium encode functions required to catabolize tricarbal-lylate ( 7 ) . 
Three of the tricarballylate utilization ( tcu ) genes , tcuABC , comprise a single transcriptional unit , whereas a fourth gene ( tcuR ) is independently transcribed from tcuABC ( 7 ) . 
We have previously shown that TcuA is an FAD-dependent tricarballylate dehydrogenase that converts tricarballylate to cis-aconitate in Vitro ( 8 ) . 
Although the function of TcuA is known , and TcuC has been shown to transport citrate across the cell membrane ( 7 ) , the biochemi ¬

cal function of TcuB remained unknown . 
The primary amino acid sequence of TcuB contained some interesting features . 
First , TcuB contains two C-X2-C-X2-C-X3-C motifs in its N-terminal half . 
These motifs are commonly found in proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters ( 9 ) . 
Second , the C-terminal half of TcuB appears to be very hydrophobic ( from residue 112 to the end ) , suggesting that TcuB may have an integral membrane domain . 
The predicted topology of TcuB is that the polypeptide contains six transmembrane-spanning domains ( 10 ) . 
An appealing hypothesis was that TcuB acted as an electron shuttle protein that reoxidized FADH2 generated by TcuA . 
Although it has been shown that oxygen can reoxidize the FADH2 in Vitro , we hypothesized that TcuB was required for efficient reoxidation of the flavin cofactor in ViVo ( 8 ) . 
Here , we report the initial biochemical characterization of TcuB . 
We show that TcuB contains two 4Fe-4S clusters in its cytosolic N-terminal half and heme in its membrane domain . 
We present evidence that TcuB is localized to the cell membrane and show that it has a strong positive effect on TcuA activity . 
On the basis of our data , we suggest that TcuB is an electron-transfer protein that accepts electrons from the reduced flavin cofactor of the tricarballylate dehydrogenase ( TcuA ) enzyme and releases these electrons to the quinone pools of the membrane using heme as the ultimate electron donor .

Purification of H6TcuB . 
Cells overproducing H6TcuB protein were grown as described above . 
Detergent-solubilized membrane extract was prepared as described above , except that after cell breakage , all steps were performed in an anoxic chamber ( Coy ) , and all buffers used were sparged with O2-free N2 for 30 min prior to use . 
H6TcuB protein was purified using His ‚ Bind Resin ( Novagen ) , as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
Protein was eluted with buffer A ( Tris-HCl ( 20 mM ) at pH 7.9 at 25 °C , NaCl ( 0.5 M ) , glycerol ( 20 % v/v ) , and imidazole ( 1.0 M ) ) . 
Fractions containing H6TcuB were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filter ( Amicon ) , as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
After concentration , the protein was desalted to remove any nickel that leached from the resin during purification using a 5-mL HiTrap Desalting column ( Amersham ) . 
This was performed using a syringe , as per manufacturer 's specifications , except that the column was equilibrated using buffer that was sparged with O2-free N2 for 30 min . 
The protein was eluted with buffer A. Protein purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) ( 21 ) after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 ( 22 ) . 
Western blots were performed using antiHis5 Tag monoclonal antibodies ( Novagen ) as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
Protein concentration was determined as described ( 23 ) . 
Purified H6TcuB protein ( 92 % homogeneous ) was dispensed into serum vials fitted with rubber stoppers and frozen at -80 °C for storage until use . 
Purification of MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 . 
The peptide comprising the first 114 amino acid residues of TcuB ( TcuB ∆ 115-380 ) was overproduced with both a maltose-binding protein ( MBP ) and a hexa-histidine tag fused to its N-terminus using plasmid pTCU80 in E. coli strain C43 . 
Overproduction conditions were the same for H6TcuB . 
Cells were harvested as described for H6TcuB . 
Following harvest , all steps were performed in an anoxic chamber ( Coy ) , and all buffers used were sparged with O2-free N2 for 30 min prior to use . 
Cells were broken by resuspension in buffer containing Tris-HCl buffer ( 20 mM ) at pH 7.9 , NaCl ( 1.0 M ) , imidazole ( 5 mM ) , lysozyme ( 1 mg/mL ) , and Bug Buster ( Novagen ) . 
Broken cells were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris . 
MBPH6TcuB ∆ 115-380 was purified using His ‚ Bind Resin ( Novagen ) , as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
Protein was eluted with Tris-HCl buffer ( 20 mM , pH 7.9 at 25 °C ) containing NaCl ( 0.5 M ) and imidazole ( 1.0 M ) . 
Glycerol was added ( 20 % v/v ) , and the protein was desalted as with H TcuB above . 
Purified MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 6 protein ( 60 % homogeneous ) was dispensed into serum vials fitted with rubber stoppers and frozen at -80 °C for storage until use . 
In-Gel Heme-Dependent Peroxidase Assay . 
To test for the presence of heme in H6TcuB , we used both a colorimetric in-gel heme peroxidase assay that consisted of H2O2 , the hydrogen donor dimethoxybenzidene ( DMB , or o-dianisi-dine ) ( 24 ) , and the chemiluminescent detection system . 
For the colorimetric detection-based assay , H6TcuB protein ( 3 µg ) , horse heart cytochrome c ( 3 µg ; positive control for hemoprotein ) , and bovine serum albumin ( 10 µg ; negative control ) were loaded onto a 12 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide separation phase with a 5 % polyacrylamide stacker layer . 
The heme peroxidase assay procedure was as described ( 24 ) with the following modifications . 
The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis running buffer consisted of Trizma base ( 25 mM ) , glycine ( 192 mM ) , and sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) ( 0.1 % w/v ) with no pH adjustment . 
The sample preparation buffer was the Non-Reducing Lane Marker Sample Buffer ( Pierce ) , which consisted of Tris-HCl buffer ( 60 mM , pH 6.8 ) , SDS ( 1 % w/v ) , glycerol ( 10 % v/v ) , and a proprietary tracking dye . 
DMB was dissolved in 20 mL of glacial acetic acid and then mixed with 160 mL of ddH2O . 
The rest of the staining procedure was as described ( 24 ) . 
Following staining with H2O2 and DMB , the polyacrylamide gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 ( 22 ) to identify bands that did not contain heme . 
For chemiluminescent detection , H6TcuB protein ( 6 µg ) , horse heart cytochrome c ( 1 µg ; positive control for hemoprotein ) , and bovine serum albumin ( 10 µg ; negative control ) were separated via SDS-PAGE as described above and transferred to a PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
The membrane was incubated with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate ( Pierce ) as per manufacturer 's instructions and exposed to X-ray film for 5 min before development . 
EPR Spectroscopy of H TcuB and MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 6 . 
Samples of TcuB ( 22 µM ) , MBP H ∆ 115-380 6TcuB ( 81 µM ) , or a pTEV6 vector-only control ( 81 µM ) were either opened to the air ( referred to as oxidized ) or incubated with sodium dithionite ( 10 mM ) for 20 min before freezing anaerobically with liquid N2-cooled isopentane . 
EPR spectra were recorded at 10 K using a Varian spectrometer with an Oxford ESR-900 continuous flow liquid He cryostat . 
Redox Potentiometry of H6TcuB . 
Spectroelectrochemical titrations were performed at 25 ( 2 °C inside an anoxic chamber ( Coy ) . 
The redox mediators used included methyl viologen ( Eo ′ ) -0.446 mV ; 0.3 µM ) , benzyl viologen ( Eo ′ ) -0.359 mV ; 1 µM ) , phenazine methosulfate ( Eo ′ ) 0.08 mV ; 1 µM ) , triphenyltetrazolium ( Eo ′ ) -0.08 mV ; 1 µM ) , quinhydrone ( Eo ′ ) 0.285 mV ; 1 µM ) , 2,6-dichloropheno-lindolphenol ( Eo ′ ) 0.217 ; 1 µM ) , and methylene blue ( µM ) . 
H6TcuB ( 4.6 µM in buffer A ) was titrated electrochemically according to the method of Dutton ( 25 ) using sodium dithionite as reductant . 
Oxidative titrations with potassium ferricyanide could not be performed because H6TcuB was unstable under the conditions used . 
Absorption spectra ( 300 
700 nm ) of 100 µL samples in a 96-well microtiter plate were recorded using a Powerwave XS spectrophotometer ( Biotek Instruments ) . 
The electrochemical potential was monitored using a 6230N pH Meter coupled to an ORP-146C Pt/AgCl combination electrode ( Lazar ) . 
The electrode was calibrated using saturated quinhydrone at pH 7.0 ( Em ) 285 mV ) and pH 4.0 ( Em ) 462 mV ) . 
The observed potentials were relative to the KCl saturated AgCl reference , and these were corrected to values relative to the standard hydrogen electrode ( SHE ) by the addition of 199 mV to the data obtained by the Pt/AgCl electrode . 
The absorbance change at 425 nm was used to determine the concentration of oxidized and reduced TcuB . 
Redox mediators did not appreciably absorb at this wavelength throughout the course of the titration . 
Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism version 4 as Eobs versus log ( [ oxidized ] / [ reduced ] ) . 
Using this plot , the midpoint potential of the half-reaction can be determined using the Nernst equation : Eobs ) Em + 2.303 ( RT/nF ) log - ( [ oxidized ] / [ reduced ) . 
At 25 °C , the slope of the line is 0.059 , and the y-intercept is the midpoint potential in V. Optimal Parameters for Assaying H6TcuB Electron Transfer . 
cis-Aconitate production was quantified using a described HPLC protocol ( 8 ) . 
Optimal tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity was measured in reaction mixtures ( 200-µL final volume ) that contained TcuA protein ( 95 % homogeneous , 1 µg ) , dithiothreitol ( DTT ; 1 mM ) , and Tris-HCl buffer ( 100 mM , pH 7.5 at 30 °C ) . 
Reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of tricarballylate ( 10 mM ) . 
Increasing amounts of H6TcuB-enriched cell-free extract ( 1 µg to 100 µg ) were added . 
Cell-free extract ( 20 µg of protein ) obtained from cells carrying empty pET15b cloning vector was used as control . 
Product formation was quantified after a 10-min incubation period . 
Optimal pH. 2-Morpholinoethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) or Tris-HCl buffer ( 100 mM ) was used to determine the optimal pH for assaying tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity . 
All buffer solutions had their pH adjusted at 30 °C . 
MES was used as buffer in reaction mixtures where the pH value was 6.5 and below . 
Tris-HCl buffer was used in reaction mixtures where the pH was 7.0 and above . 
After the addition of tricarballylate ( 10 mM ) , 40-µL samples were removed after 3 , 6 , and 9 min of incubation at 30 °C and added to 60-µL of sulfuric acid ( 167 mM ) . 
Samples ( 50-µL ) were analyzed by HPLC as described ( 8 ) . 
The optimal pH for TcuA activity in the absence of H6TcuB was determined as described ( 8 ) . 
All reactions were performed in triplicate . 
Optimal Temperature . 
After finding an apparent pH optimum for H6TcuB enhanced tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity , the optimal temperature was determined . 
Assays were performed at 25 , 30 , 37 , and 45 °C using MES buffer ( 100 mM ) at pH 6.5 at each temperature assayed . 
After the addition of tricarballylate ( 10 mM ) , 40-µL samples were removed after 3 , 6 , and 9 min of incubation at 30 °C and added to 60 µL of sulfuric acid ( 167 mM ) . 
Samples ( 50-µL ) were analyzed by HPLC as described ( 8 ) . 
All reactions were performed in triplicate . 
The optimal temperature for TcuA activity in the absence of H6TcuB was determined as described ( 8 ) . 
All reactions were performed in triplicate . 
Kinetic Parameters . 
Optimal conditions were used to assay TcuA activity as a function of substrate concentration in both the presence and absence of H6TcuB extract . 
The range of tricarballylate concentrations analyzed was between 0.1 and 
10 mM . 
For reactions containing H6TcuB extract , 40-µL samples were removed at 1 , 2 , and 3-min intervals following the addition of tricarballylate . 
For reactions containing only TcuA , 40-µL samples were removed after 30 min following the addition of tricarballylate . 
Samples were added to 60-µL of 167 mM sulfuric acid to give a final sulfuric acid concentration of 100 mM . 
Samples ( 50-µL ) were analyzed by HPLC as described ( 8 ) . 
H6TcuB Inhibition . 
Optimal conditions were used to assay TcuA activity in either the presence or the absence of H6-TcuB-enriched cell-free extract . 
After the addition of tricarballylate ( 10 mM ) to the reaction mixture , 40-µL samples were removed at either 10 or 60 min for samples that did or did not contain H6TcuB extract , respectively . 
Samples were added to 60 µL of sulfuric acid ( 167 mM ) to give a final sulfuric acid concentration of 100 mM . 
Fifty microliters of the samples were injected and developed using the HPLC method as described ( 8 ) . 
Inhibitors used were potassium cyanide ( KCN ; 100 µM and 1 mM ) , 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone ( DBMIB ; 100 µM and 1 mM ) , and bathophenanthroline ( Bth ; 10 µM and 100 µM ) . 
DBMIB was dissolved in ethanol , thus the control treatment for TcuA activity included 2 % ( v/v ) ethanol . 
Metal Analysis . 
TcuA ( 20 µM ) was dialyzed overnight into buffer containing N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ; 20 mM ) at pH 7.5 at 4 °C and tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) - phosphine ( TCEP ; 0.25 mM ) . 
Samples containing TcuA and a buffer control were analyzed for bound metal ions by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry ( ICPES ; Chemical Analysis Laboratory , University of Georgia ) by using a Thermo Jarrell-Ash 965 ( New Port Richey , FL ) inductively coupled argon plasma spectrophotometer . 
For TcuB and MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 , samples were concentrated by using a Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filter ( Amicon ) , as per manufacturer 's instructions , and the flow through was used as a buffer control . 
This was done to avoid the precipitation that occurred during dialysis . 
TcuB ( 11 µM ) and MBPH6TcuB ∆ 115-380 ( 27 µM ) were analyzed for bound metals by ICPES ( Soil and Plant Analysis Lab , University of Wisconsin Madison ) by using a Thermo Jarrell-Ash IRIS Advantage inductively coupled argon plasma spectrophotometer . 
RESULTS
TcuB Protein Contains Heme . 
We used plasmid pTCU55 to overproduce H6TcuB protein , which was purified under anoxic conditions using nickel affinity chromatography . 
Membrane preparations enriched with H6TcuB had a deep-red color . 
Membrane preparations obtained from cells carrying the empty cloning vector used to overproduce H6-TcuB were colorless . 
Purified H6TcuB protein ( g92 % homogeneous , Figure 1 ) was red . 
Purified H6TcuB protein had an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa on the basis of SDS-PAGE compared to a predicted mass of 42 kDa . 
Western blots using anti-His Tag monoclonal antibodies detected a single band at 35 kDa in both cell lysates and purified H6TcuB ( data not shown ) . 
The EPR spectrum of purified H6TcuB exposed to air contained signals consistent with the presence of low-spin heme ( Figure 2A . ) 
The measured g-values of gz ) 2.96 , gy ) 2.28 , and gx ) 1.85 correspond to those reported for other proteins with a low 
F 2 : EPR spectroscopy of H TcuB and MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 . 
IGURE 6 6 Oxidized full-length H6TcuB ( A ) , oxidized MBPH ∆ 115-380 6TcuB ( B ) , and dithionite reduced MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 ( C ) . 
spin heme ( 26 ) . 
We were unable to account for the g-value ) at g 2.46 , and hypothesize that it may be free heme that dissociated during handling of the protein . 
The UV-visible absorbance spectrum of purified H6TcuB was dominated by a Soret band characteristic of heme cofactors ( Figure 3 ) . 
The presence of heme in the H6TcuB protein was confirmed by in-gel , heme-dependent peroxidase activity assays . 
Results from these assays indicated that the heme cofactor was not covalently attached to the protein because the bulk of the heme migrated with the dye front ( Figure 1A ) . 
More sensitive chemiluminescent detection verified that some heme remains associated with H6TcuB ( Figure 1B ) . 
Purified H6TcuB protein lacking the last 266 amino acid residues comprising the membrane domain lacked the Soret band suggesting that the membrane domain housed the heme cofactor ( data not shown ) . 
TcuB Contains Two 4Fe-4S Clusters . 
TcuB contains two cysteine-rich motifs characteristic of proteins with 4Fe-4S clusters ( 9 ) . 
Acidification of the protein created a distinct rotten-egg odor suggestive of acid-labile sulfur found in Fe-S clusters . 
The EPR spectrum of both purified full-length H6TcuB and MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380D 6 protein provided evidence for 4Fe-4S clusters . 
The EPR spectrum of oxidized H6TcuB contained a signal consistent with a 4Fe-4S cluster in the +3 oxidation state ( 27 ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The g-value of 2.05 was in excellent agreement with the reported g-values for other [ 4Fe-4S ] +3 clusters ( 27 ) . 
However , the assignment of the peaks in the spectrum was complicated by the presence of at least one heme species as described above . 
The EPR spectrum of oxidized MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 , a variant that lacks the predicted membrane domain , contained a signal ( g ) 2.03 ) consistent with a 3Fe-4S cluster ( Figure 3B ) as well as considerable amounts of free iron . 
Free iron was only detected in spectra from oxidized protein , which was consistent with the breakdown of 4Fe-4S clusters to 3Fe-4S clusters because of oxidative damage . 
The EPR spectrum ∆ 115-380 of variant MBPH6TcuB protein reduced with dithionite contained multiple signals at < 2.0 g which were consistent with reduced 4Fe-4S clusters ( Figure 3C ) . 
The EPR spectrum from purified vector-only control protein extract did not contain any signals consistent with any type of iron-sulfur cluster ( data not shown ) . 
Metal analysis was performed on both the full-length H6TcuB and MBPH6TcuB ∆ 115-380 variant to determine the molar quantities of iron and sulfur . 
The results indicated that H6TcuB contained 12.4 mol S and 6 mol Fe per mol of protein , whereas MBPH TcuB ∆ 115-380 6 contained 5.6 mol S and 1.7 mol Fe per mol of protein , which suggested that both proteins contained substoichiometric amounts of their metal cofactors . 
To determine whether the putative cysteine-rich motifs were required for tcuB function , alanine substitutions were made in the cysteines of each motif ; C31 , C34 , and C38 for the first cluster , and C62 , C68 , and C72 for the second . 
Mutant alleles were tested for the ability to complement chromosomal S. enterica tcuB missense mutant ( strain JE6335 ) . 
None of the mutant alleles restored growth on tricarballylate after 36 h ( Figure 4 ) , which provided support for the idea that the cysteine residues tested were necessary for protein function . 
Although we can not exclude the possibility that the cysteine residues are merely structurally important , these results were consistent with the cysteines being ligands for 4Fe-4S clusters . 
Variant proteins were unstable and could not be isolated , and consequently , no EPR spectra were obtained . 
Redox potentiometry of H6TcuB was performed to determine the midpoint potential for the heme cofactor of the protein . 
Reduction of the protein with dithionite red-shifted the Soret band from 412 to 425 nm , together with the appearance of a peak at 556 nm ( Figure 2 ) . 
The results showed the presence of two heme species in solution , as indicated by the biphasic nature of the curve ( data not shown ) ; protein precipitation was observed throughout the titration , which suggested that one of the heme species seen in the titration was artifactual . 
Shown in Figure 2B is the titration curve for the more electronegative species ( E ) m -162 ( 7 mV ) . 
The more electropositive species had a midpoint potential of 34 ( 6 mV ( Figure 2C ) . 
TcuB Enhances the ActiVity of TcuA . 
The observation that TcuB contained two 4Fe-4S clusters and heme suggested that TcuB was an electron-transfer protein . 
Because tcuB function is required in ViVo for S. enterica to grow on tricarballylate ( 7 ) , we hypothesized that the role of TcuB was to reoxidize the FADH2 electron carrier of TcuA . 
To test this idea , TcuA tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity was measured with varying amounts of H6-TcuB-enriched cell-free extract . 
At saturating levels of H6-TcuB , the amount of TcuA product ( cis-aconitate ) produced per min was 32.5-fold higher than the control experiment that lacked H6-TcuB protein ( Figure 5 ) . 
Reassessment of TcuA Kinetic Parameters as a Function of H6-TcuB . 
pH and temperature optima for tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity were determined in the presence of saturating amounts of H6-TcuB . 
Previously , optimal activity for TcuA was shown to occur within a pH between 7.0 and 7.5 with a temperature optimum near 30 °C ( 8 ) . 
To test whether H6-TcuB affected these values , the pH and temperature profiles of TcuA with and without H6-TcuB were reassessed ( Tables 2and 3 ) . 
The addition of H6-TcuB did not appear to appreciably affect the pH optimum of TcuA . 
However , in the presence of H6-TcuB , TcuA activity had a lower temperature optimum , the significance of which is unknown . 
Kinetic parameters for TcuA were re-evaluated in the presence of H6-TcuB under optimized pH and temperature conditions ( Figure 6 ) . 
Tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity assays were performed at pH 6.5 at 25 °C . 
The Km of TcuA for tricarballylate at pH 6.5 increased almost an order of magnitude compared to the values reported for that at pH 7.5 ( 8 ) . 
The presence of H6-TcuB did not change the Km of TcuA for tricarballylate . 
However , the velocity of the TcuA reaction increased by over 2 orders of magnitude in the presence of H6-TcuB . 
The kinetic parameters for TcuA in the presence and absence of H6TcuB are presented in Table 4 . 
Inhibition Studies of TcuB . 
The H6TcuB-mediated enhancement of TcuA activity was subjected to various inhibitors to help address whether the cofactors of TcuB are necessary for TcuB activity ( Figure 7 ) . 
Potassium cyanide , a known inhibitor of hemoproteins ( 28 ) , inhibited Tcu activity in the presence of H TcuB by 67 % at 1 mM , whereas 6 TcuA by itself was not inhibited at all . 
Bathophenanthroline ( Bth ) , an iron chelator ( 29 ) , inhibited TcuA activity in the presence of H TcuB by 80 % at 100 µM . 
TcuA was also 6 inhibited by 100 µM Bth , but to a lesser extent ( 40 % ) . 
Metal analysis of TcuA showed 0.1 mol of both Ca and Zn per mol of TcuA , with no iron detected ( data not shown ) . 
TcuA activity remained unchanged with the addition of 1 - or 2-fold molar excess of either CaCl2 or ZnCl2 ( data not shown ) . 
2,5-Dibromo-3-methyl-6-isoproylbenzoquinone ( DBMIB ) , an inhibitor of ubiquinone oxidation in succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome bd ( 30 ) , was tested to determine if the quinone pool accepted electrons from the heme group of TcuB . 
DBMIB ( 1 mM ) strongly inhibited TcuA activity in the presence of H TcuB ( 98 % ) compared to just 23 % for 6 TcuA alone .

DISCUSSION
Here , we describe the initial biochemical and functional characterization of TcuB protein of S. enterica . 
Previous biochemical characterization of TcuA found that the enzyme converted tricarballylate to cis-aconitate and was thus the only catabolic function required to convert tricarballylate into a common metabolic intermediate . 
We also noted that in Vitro TcuA had a low Vmax for a catabolic enzyme . 
The biochemical characterization of TcuB fills an important gap in our understanding of tricarballylate catabolism . 
The fact that TcuB improves the Vmax for TcuA by > 100 × in Vitro explains why a tcuB mutant can not grow on tricarballylate despite having the necessary catabolic enzyme ( TcuA ) to convert tricarballylate to cis-aconitate . 
We propose that the 4Fe-4S clusters and heme of TcuB serve as cofactors for facilitating the transfer of electrons from the FADH2 group of TcuA to the quinone pool of the cytoplasmic membrane . 
Tricarballylate growth defects of mutants in the two conserved cysteine motifs support the hypothesis that these cysteines are ligands for 4Fe-4S clusters , although it can not be ruled out that mutations are only affecting protein structure or stability . 
The absence of TcuB antibodies for Western blotting leaves this an outstanding question . 
The diagnostic Soret band of TcuB and a double-stain for hemoproteins provides strong evidence that TcuB contains noncovalent heme . 
The amino acid sequence for TcuB does not contain a C-X-X-C-H motif consistent with c-type cytochromes , thus TcuB is more likely to contain a b-type heme . 
Although a second heme species was detected during redox potentiometry , we interpret this species to be an artifact due to the precipitation of the protein over the course of the experiment . 
The relatively high redox potential of the second heme species would seem to preclude it from participating in electron transfer from iron-sulfur centers or the other heme to the quinone pool . 
The pathway of reoxidation of FADH2 via Fe-S clusters and heme by TcuA and TcuB seems analogous conceptuall to the succinate dehydrogenase complex . 
In fact , TcuA shares sequence similarity with SdhA , and tricarballylate is similar in structure to succinate ( differing by a methylcarboxyl group ) . 
However , TcuB shares no homology with SdhB , SdhC , or SdhD . 
SdhB contains one 2Fe-2S cluster , one 3Fe-4S cluster , and one 4Fe-4S cluster , whereas TcuB appears to contain two 4Fe-4S clusters . 
It is probable that TcuB evolved separately . 
For TcuB to continue to reoxidize the FADH2 from TcuA , the electrons need to be passed from the iron-sulfur clusters and the heme into an electron sink . 
Redox potentiometry studies of TcuB were complicated by the presence of free heme . 
However , we interpret the more electronegative species to be TcuB . 
The midpoint potential for TcuB would fall between that of 4Fe-4S clusters and quinones , suggesting that the heme links electrons from the Fe-S clusters to the quinone pool ( Figure 8 ) . 
Vmax ( nmol min-1 m k ( s-1 cat ) k / K ( M-1 s-1 ) cat m 
Our model shows electrons traveling from FADH to the 2 two 4Fe-4S clusters , then to heme , and ultimately to the quinone pool . 
The use of a known inhibitor of ubiquinol oxidation , DBMIB , showed that TcuA activity in the presence of the H - TcuB extract was markedly decreased , 6 strongly suggesting that the quinone pool is required for efficient oxidation of TcuA FADH2 .
