Keywords 
SurE , the stationary-phase survival protein of Salmonella typhimurium , forms part of a stress survival operon regulated by the stationary-phase RNA polymerase alternative sigma factor . 
SurE is known to improve bacterial viability during stress conditions . 
It functions as a phosphatase speciﬁc to nucleoside monophosphates . 
In the present study we reported the X-ray crystal structure of SurE from Salmonella typhimurium . 
The protein crystallized in two forms : orthorhombic F222 ; and monoclinic C2 . 
The two structures were determined to resolutions of 1.7 and 2.7 Å , respectively . 
The protein exists as a domain-swapped dimer . 
The residue D230 is involved in several interactions that are probably crucial for domain swapping . 
A divalent metal ion is found at the active site of the enzyme , which is consistent with the divalent metal ion-dependent activity of the enzyme . 
Interactions of the conserved DD motif present at the N-terminus with the phosphate and the Mg present in the active site suggest that these resi-2 + dues play an important role in enzyme activity . 
The divalent metal ion speciﬁcity and the kinetic constants of SurE were determined using the gen-eric phosphatase substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate . 
The enzyme was inactive in the absence of divalent cations and was most active in the pres-2 + ence of Mg . 
Thermal denaturation studies showed that S. typhimurium SurE is much less stable than its homologues and an attempt was made to understand the molecular basis of the lower thermal stability based on solvation free-energy . 
This is the ﬁrst detailed crystal structure analysis of SurE from a mesophilic organism .

During stress and the stationary phase of growth , bacterial cells undergo a variety of morphological and physiological changes . 
To tide over these unfavorable conditions , several genes are induced . 
The rpoS-encoded stationary-phase RNA polymerase alternative sigma factor rS ( RpoS ) plays a major role as a regulator of genes involved in the response to stress .

The surE gene was ﬁrst discovered in E. coli by Clarke and co-workers [ 1 ] . 
E. coli strains with a mutant surE gene survived poorly in the stationary phase and under conditions of high temperature and high salt compared with parent strains that had the intact surE gene [ 1 ] . 
The surE gene duplicated in a strain of E. coli subjected to 2000 generations of high-temperature growth , which again emphasizes its role in the stress response [ 2 ] . 
surE is an ancient and well-conserved gene distributed across various kingdoms . 
The exact biochemical role of SurE is still not very clear . 
PHO2 protein ( from the yeast Yarrowia lipo-lytica ) that had a low level of sequence similarity with the N-terminal domain of SurE proteins complemented mutations in two acid phosphatases of Saccharo-myces cerevisiae , which led to the proposal that SurE might be an acid phosphatase [ 3 ] . 
Later studies on SurEs clearly demonstrated that in contrast to nonspe-ciﬁc acid phosphatases , SurE proteins showed speciﬁcity towards nucleoside monophosphates and hence it was proposed that SurE could be designated a nucleo-tidase . 
These studies also revealed that SurE shows a divalent metal ion-dependent nucleotidase activity and can dephosphorylate various ribose and deoxyribo-nucleoside monophosphates with highest afﬁnity towards 3 ' - AMP . 
E. coli SurE ( Ec SurE ) also showed exopolyphosphatase activity with preference for short chain-length substrates ( P20-25 ) [ 4 ] . 
It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates guanosine-5 cents - O-c thiotriphosphate-stimulated l-isoaspartyl methyl transferase in rat kidney cytosol [ 5 ] . 
Studies have shown that there is a functional relationship between SurE and Pcm . 
l-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase converts isoapartyl residues to l-aspartyl residues and thereby repairs damaged proteins that can accumulate with time in senescent cells . 
A copy of either pcm or surE appears to be sufﬁcient to avoid isoaspartyl damage during stress [ 6 ] . 
This observation suggested that the two genes might represent parallel pathways by which E. coli responds to protein damage .

The structure of Aa SurE has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank , but has not been described in the literature . 
Here we report a detailed analysis of the crystal structure of SurE from a mesophilic organism -- Salmonella typhimurium ( St SurE ) . 
Results of activity studies with the substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate ( pNPP ) , are also presented . 
Thermal denaturation studies have shown that St SurE is much less stable than its homologues and an attempt was made to understand the molecular basis of the lower thermal stability . 
Results and Discussion
Preliminary characterization and crystallization of the protein 
The surE gene from S. typhimurium was cloned in an isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside ( IPTG ) - inducible vector , overexpressed in E. coli and puriﬁed to homogeneity using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid afﬁnity chromatography . 
The puriﬁed protein showed a single polypeptide band in SDS ⁄ PAGE corresponding to a molecular mass of 28 kDa , which agreed with the theoretically calculated molecular mass from the sequence including the additional amino acids resulting from the cloning strategy . 
The molecular mass of the protein was also conﬁrmed by MALDI-TOF MS. CD spectra indicated a wellfolded protein , and dynamic light-scattering measurements showed a monodisperse distribution . 
Hence the enzyme was considered suitable for crystallization . 
The protein crystallized under oil in two forms . 
Orthorhombic crystals ( F222-SurE ) were obtained in the presence of 0.2 m trisodium citrate dihydrate , 0.1 m Hepes ( pH 7.5 ) and 30 % 2-methyl-2 ,4 - pentane-diol , and monoclinic crystals ( C2-SurE ) were obtained under conditions of 0.1 m Mes ( pH 6.5 ) and 12 % poly ( ethylene glycol ) 20 000 . 
The asymmetric unit contained one protein subunit in the F222-SurE crystal and four subunits in the C2-SurE crystal with Mathew 's coefﬁcients of 2.8 and 3.1 , respectively . 
Data-collection statistics are given in Table 1 . 
Structure solution and quality of the model
F222-SurE was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 1.7 Å using Tm SurE as the phasing model . 
Subsequently , this reﬁned model was used to solve the structure of the C2-SurE to a resolution of 2.7 Å . 
In both crystal forms the electron density accounted for the majority of the residues . 
There were no disordered regions in the map . 
The quality of reﬁnement of the two crystal forms is shown in Table 1 . 
Cis peptides were found between R81 and P82 and between G90 and I91 . 
A similar cis peptide between G93 and V94 is found in Tm SurE also . 
Overall structural features of the protein
St SurE is an aba sandwich protein and adopts the Rossmann fold as in archaic and thermophilic homologues . 
The St SurE monomer consists of 13 b-strands , six a-helices and three 310-helices . 
The core of the protein is made up of a nine-stranded b-sheet ﬂanked by a1 , a5 and g2 on one side and by a2 , a3 , a4 and g1 
Disallowed region 0.0 0.0 P P a Rmerge = hj | Ihj ) <Ih> | ⁄ Ihj , where <Ihj> is the jth observation of reﬂection h and <Ih> is its mean intensity . 
on the other side ( Fig. 1A , B ) . 
One noticeable difference between St SurE and the other SurEs is the short length of g1 and a3 followed by a longer loop region . 
This region includes three conserved active-site residues ( S104 , G105 and T106 ) and occurs at the dimeric interface . 
A monomer comprises two domains ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Residues 1 -- 125 form the N-terminal domain that is mostly conserved among members of the SurE family . 
This domain consists of b1 to b6 , a1 to a3 and g1 . 
The shown in green and blue , respectively . 
The darker and lighter shades of the respective colors represent the N-terminal and C-ter-minal domains of the corresponding subunits . 
D230 , which is involved in crucial interactions that may be responsible for domain swapping , is shown at the top of the drawing . 
The arrow points towards the active site . 
sequence identity among pairs of SurEs varies from 31 % to 42 % . 
Residues 126 to 253 form the C-terminal domain , which consists of b7 to b13 , a4 , a5 , g2 and g3 . 
This domain is more divergent among the various SurEs and the sequence identities among the polypeptides in this region vary from 20 % to 35 % . 
The C-terminal domain consists of two protruding arms : ( a ) a C-terminal helical tail ( g3 , a6 ) , which extends to the neighboring subunit to form a domain-swapped dimer ; and ( b ) a b-hairpin , which is involved in intersubunit interactions , leading to a loose tetrameric organization of subunits ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The overall structure and the St SurE N-terminal domain superposed well with the corresponding domains in other SurEs yielding rmsd values of 0.81 -- 1.26 Å . 
However , there was a larger variation in the C-terminal domains ( yielding rmsd values ranging from 1.84 to 2.89 Å ) . 
A search using the DALI server with the C terminal domain as the query did not produce any signiﬁcant hits other than the SurEs already known . 
However , the N-terminal domain aligned with certain other proteins such as the 1lss-A trk system potassium-uptake protein trka homolog , which is present ubiquitously in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic K channels and transporters , and another universal stress protein with Z-scores of around 6 . 
Similar results have been reported for Tm and Pa SurEs . 
Superposition of the protomers of monoclinic and orthorhombic forms using the program align [ 7 ] gave an rmsd of 0.54 Å between corresponding Ca atoms . 
The variation was larger with respect to the C-domain , which gave an

Oligomeric status of the protein
The oligomeric status of SurE proteins is of much interest . 
Pa SurE has been reported to exist as a dimer in solution , whereas Ec SurE is a tetramer . 
Lee et al. [ 8 ] report a dimeric structure for Tm SurE , whereas Zhang et al. [ 9 ] report that Tm SurE exists as a tetra-meric protein in solution . 
Iwasaki & Miki [ 10 ] demonstrated a dimer -- tetramer equilibrium in Tt SurE based on sedimentation equilibrium experiments . 
In St SurE , the four subunits in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic form , which were labeled as A , B , C and D , are related by 222 noncrystallographic symmetry . 
In the orthorhombic form , the subunits related by crystallographic twofolds form a tetramer very similar to that of the monoclinic form . 
The total surface-accessible area buried on dimerization of A and B subunits of the monoclinic form is 7633 Å , which suggests tight 2 association . 
The area buried in the interface of the subunits related by twofold along a in F222-SurE is comparable ( 7000 Å ) . 
In contrast , the AD and AC 2 interfaces of the monoclinic form bury only 419 and 902 Å respectively . 
These buried areas are not sufﬁ-2 cient for tight association . 
Gel ﬁltration analysis and dynamic light-scattering experiments also indicated that SurE is a dimer in solution . 
Although the tetrameric unit is weakly held by AD and AC interfaces , it is interesting that a highly similar oligo-meric structure is observed in Tt SurE and Tm SurE , which might imply that tetramerization has some physiological role . 
All SurEs , with the exception of Pa SurE , have been reported to show domain swapping between the mono-mers of the dimer . 
Eisenberg and coworkers [ 11 ] have reported that Pa SurE predominantly exists in a nondomain-swapped dimeric form . 
Domain swapping is avoided in Pa SurE by a sharp turn in the segment of residues 242 -- 245 , bringing the polypeptide chain back to the same subunit . 
We analyzed the interactions of corresponding residues in SurEs to understand the reasons for domain swapping . 
A few strong interactions were observed that impart rigidity to this segment , preventing it from turning backwards in most SurEs . 
These interactions in St SurE include D230 OD1-T232 N ( 2.95 Å ) , D230 OD1-T232 OG1 ( 2.66 Å ) and D230 OD2-H234 NE2 ( 2.89 Å ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Thus , D230 is a crucial residue that appears to be essential for domain swapping . 
The equivalent residue is also conserved in Aa SurE ( D234 ) . 
H234 of St SurE is replaced with Y238 in Aa SurE . 
The hydroxyl group of Y238 is hydrogen bonded to D234 OD1 ( 2.55 Å ) . 
The other interactions of D234 in Aa SurE correspond to the interactions of D230 in St SurE . 
A different set of interactions appears to promote a rigid structure leading to domain swapping in Tt and Tm SurE . 
These or other interactions that impart a rigid structure are not observed in Pa SurE . 
rmsd of 0.70 Å . 
Intersubunit contacts
St SurE forms a strong domain-swapped dimer ( Fig. 1C ) . 
The dimer is held mainly by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions . 
Most of the residues that are involved in the dimerization are found on the C-terminal helix responsible for the domain swapping . 
There are two salt bridges -- between R52 and D190 and between R114 and D99 ( cut off value 4.5 Å ) -- and 33 strong hydrogen bonds ( cut off value 3 Å ) across the dimeric interface . 
The thermophilic SurEs have a larger number of salt bridges compared with St SurE ( Tm Sure-5 , Tt SurE-7 , Aa SurE-4 ) . 
However , Pa SurE , which is also thermostable , has only a single salt bridge . 
In the tetrameric unit of St SurE , the number of contacts between the A and C subunits are more than the contacts between the A and D subunits . 
The stretch of residues from 186 to 198 that are pres-ent in the b-hairpin extension are mainly involved in the tetrameric interactions at the AC interface . 
Q188 , P191 and W198 are the major contributors to several symmetry-related pairs of interactions at this interface . 
In the AD interface , there is a salt bridge between E48 and R192 . 
Stability of St SurE
Urea denaturation studies were carried out by incubating the protein at a concentration of 0.5 mgÆmol ) 1 with varying concentrations of urea ( 0 -- 7 m ) for 4 h after which CD measurements were taken ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The minimum near 222 nm , representative of helical structure , was disrupted by incubation of the protein with urea at a concentration of 2 m and it almost completely disappeared at around 4 m urea . 
It is noteworthy that the minimum near 209 nm , which represents the b-structure , was still retained , although reduced in intensity , even after incubation with 7 m urea . 
This might be because the b-sheets , which form the core of the protein , are still intact while the helices that form the outer layers of the sandwich protein have denatured . 
Following this , thermal melting studies were conducted using circular diachronic monitoring at both 209 and 222 nm . 
The protein lost its secondary structure at a temperature of around 45 C ( Fig. 4B ) . 
This was also conﬁrmed by differential scanning calorimetry ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , the biphasic denaturation pro-ﬁle is observed with urea but not with thermal dena-turation . 
The St SurE melting temperature is very low compared with its homologues , which are active even at temperatures above 80 C . 
A detailed analysis of the amino acid residue composition , hydrophobic bur-ied residues , salt bridges , hydrogen bonding , etc. , could not account for the lower thermostability of St SurE . 
Following this , an analysis of the solvation free-energy of folding for the ﬁve SurEs was carried out using the software msd pisa ( Table 2 ) . 
The solvation free-energy ( SFE ) follows a linear relationship with the number of residues and satisﬁes an empirical relationship SFE = 15.30 ) 1.13 N , where N is the number of resi-dues in the polypeptide chain [ 12 ] . 
The table also shows the difference in percentage between SFEs calculated using pisa and expected on the basis of the linear relationship . 
This difference is small ( < 10 % ) for well folded and stable proteins , whereas for misfolded proteins it is usually larger than 10 % [ 12 ] . 
The large difference in SFEs for St SurE suggests that the lower value of SFE is the most probable reason for its lower thermal stability . 
This would be a consequence of the precise amino acid sequence of St SurE and its relationship to the polypeptide fold .

Phosphatase activity studies
The phosphatase activity of SurE against pNPP was measured at various temperatures , pH values and in the presence of different metal ions . 
The enzyme showed negligible activity at temperatures above 50 C . 
This is in agreement with stability studies , which indicated that the denaturation temperature of St SurE is around 45 C . 
The activity of St SurE was maximal at neutral pH ( Fig. 4C ) . 
This was similar to that of Ec SurE . 
However , Tm SurE and Pa SurE have maximal activity towards pNPP at an acidic pH , around 5.5 , and Tt SurE was maximally active at pH 8.2 . 
St SurE shows almost no activity in the absence of divalent metal ions . 
Activation by various metal ions was in the order Mg > Mn > Ca > Zn > Ni > Co 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + ( Fig. 4D ) . 
Tm SurE and Tt SurE also show maximum activity with Mg . 
However , unlike Ec SurE and Pa 2 + SurE , there was negligible activity in the presence of

Geometry of the active site
The putative active site could be identiﬁed by the presence of bound magnesium and phosphate ions and by comparison with the active sites of other SurEs . 
There are 15 residues in the putative active site that are mostly conserved across the various SurEs . 
These resi-dues are solely located in the N-terminal domain . 
The active site is found near the interface between the two monomers ( Fig. 1C ) and is partly acidic because of the presence of the conserved DD motif ( D8 and D9 ) ( Fig. 5A ) . 
As the precipitating condition used for crystallization did not contain any divalent cations , the magnesium ion is probably co-puriﬁed with the protein . 
The ion is coordinated by the carboxyl oxygen atoms of D8 , D9 , by the carboxamide oxygen of N92 , by the hydroxyl oxygen of S39 and by the oxygen atoms of two water molecules , and has an approximate octahedral geometry ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Not all of the six ligands coordinated to the metal ion in F222-SurE can be seen in C2-SurE probably because of the lower resolution of the structure . 
When Tt SurE binds Mg 2 + and AMP , the loop formed by residues 34 -- 50 undergoes conformational change from a ` closed ' to an ` open ' form . 
The shift in the position of the loop away from the metal ion leads to the formation of two interprotomer active sites where the Oe of E37 from one subunit coordinates with the metal ion bound to the other subunit . 
In St SurE , this loop is in a closed conformation . 
As Iwasaki and Miki [ 10 ] report , only if the loop is in an open conformation there is enough space in the active site to accommodate the substrate . 
In the closed form , the hydroxyl group of S39 coordinates with the metal ion of the same subunit . 
When AMP binds , its side chain clashes with the ribose moiety of the bound AMP if the loop does not adopt an open conformation . 
Co-crystallization and soaking trials with various putative substrates such as AMP , GMP and CMP have not so far been successful . 
Apart from Mg and water molecules , a strong 2 + tetrahedral density was found in the active site ( Fig. 5A ) . 
A phosphate ion was modeled at this site assuming that it could have come from the cell because it is a putative phosphatase enzyme . 
The phosphate ﬁtted well in the density . 
Reﬁnement resulted in reasonable B values for the phosphates when the occupancy was set to 0.5 . 
In the F222-SurE structure , the phosphate hydrogen bonds to several molecules of water and to OD1 of N96 whereas in the C2-SurE structure , phosphate bonds with Mg ( 2.18 Å ) and hydrogen 2 + bonds with the OG of S104 ( 2.87 Å ) , with OD1 and OD2 of D8 ( 2.82 , 3.41 Å ) , with ND2 and OD1 of N96 ( 2.92 , 3.02 Å ) , with OG1 of T106 ( 3.03 Å ) , with N of G105 ( 3.05 Å ) and G40 ( 3.05 Å ) . 
An oxygen atom of the phosphate coordinates with the metal ion in two of the four subunits in the asymmetric unit of C2-SurE . 
The interaction of the phosphate with G40 may prevent loop opening in St SurE .

Possible mechanism of phosphatase activity
The molecular mechanism of the phosphatase activity of SurE has not yet been established . 
The substrate might enter through an open channel that is present at the dimeric interface ( Fig. 1C ) . 
This channel covers a volume of 889 Å and an area of 535.5 Å and is lined 3 2 by the residues R36 , N37 , R38 , S39 , G40 , Al41 , S44 , L45 , T46 , L47 , E48 , L51 , M65 and T67 . 
The positions of phosphate in C2-SurE and F222-SurE are not identical . 
The distance between these positions is 2.76 Å . 
The position corresponding to the phosphate in C2-SurE is occupied by a water molecule ( water 228 ) in F222-SurE . 
The strict conservation of the DD motif in SurEs strongly suggests that these residues are involved in catalysis . 
Only in C2-SurE is D8 at an appropriate distance from phosphate for a nucleophilic attack . 
The distance between OD1 of D8 and the phosphate is 3.26 Å in C2-SurE and 5.74 Å in F222-SurE . 
The distance of the phosphate from the metal ion is also greater in F222-SurE ( 5.96 Å ) when compared with C2-SurE ( 3.46 Å ) . 
These observations suggest that the phosphate position in C2-SurE is most likely to correspond to that of the substrate mononucleoside phosphate . 
The interactions of phosphorus with the metal ion in C2-SurE may help to polarize the phosphate bond for nucleophilic attack . 
The divalent metal ion might also orient the nucleophilic D8 so that it can attack the phosphorus atom of the monophosphate . 
This nucleo-philic attack may lead to a phosphorylated D8 enzyme intermediate . 
The next step in catalysis requires an activated water molecule to produce an OH ion , which willhydrolyze the D8 phosphate intermediate to release a phosphate and regenerate the active enzyme . 
Unfortunately , the water molecule suitable for such activation was not found in C2-SurE , perhaps because of its low resolution . 
Several water molecules have been located in the active site of F222-SurE . 
However , these water mol-ecules may not correspond to that required for catalysis as the phosphate is probably not optimally placed in F222-SurE . 
The mechanism proposed here is similar to that of TA0175 , a phosphoglycolate phosphatase belonging to the HAD superfamily of proteins [ 13 ] with which SurE shows several common active-site features . 
The nucleotidase activity of SurE may be required for phosphorus scavenging and remobilization when the cells are under stress and consequently mononucleotide phosphate concentrations are high . 
Materials and methods
Cloning and puriﬁcation of St SurE
The SurE gene was PCR ampliﬁed from Salmonella enterica Typhimurum strain IFO12529 genomic DNA as the template using Deep Vent DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) , a sense primer ( CATATGGCTAGC ATGCGCATATTGCTGAGTAAC ) containing an NheI site and an antisense primer ( TTAGGATCCTTACCATTGCG TGCCAACTCCCAC ) containing a BamHI site . 
The gene was cloned at the NheI and BamHI sites of the pRSET-C vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 
The sequence of the recombinant SurE clone obtained was determined and con-ﬁrmed by comparison with the S. typhimurium genome . 
The cloning strategy resulted in 14 additional amino acids from the vector at the N terminus of the expressed protein , including a hexahistidine tag that facilitated protein puriﬁcation . 
The recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells and transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 lgÆmL ) 1 of ampicillin . 
A single colony was picked and cultured in 25 mL of Terriﬁc broth overnight at 37 C then inoculated into 500 mL of Terriﬁc broth containing 2 mL of glycerol and grown until the D reached 0.6 at 600 nm . 
Protein expression was then induced by 0.3 mm IPTG . 
The culture was further incubated at 30 C for 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in lysis buffer that contained 50 mm Tris ( pH 8 ) , 200 mm NaCl , 2 % Triton X-100 and 30 % glycerol , and then lysed by sonication on ice . 
The supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the cell lysate was gently mixed with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 2 -- 3 h and then loaded onto a glass column . 
Nonspeciﬁcally bound proteins were washed from the column using 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole . 
The recombinant protein was eluted with 5 mL of lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole . 
The protein was dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Tris ( pH 8 ) containing 100 mm NaCl to remove imidazole . 
St SurE was obtained with a ﬁnal ) 1 yield of 30 mgÆL of cell culture . 
The protein was concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . 
Initial characterization of the protein
The purity and molecular mass of the protein were checked by 12 % SDS ⁄ PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. Gel-permeation chromatography with 200 lL of a 1 mgÆmL ) 1 protein solution was performed using a Superdex S-200 column with a bed volume of 28 mL and a void volume of 8 mL . 
Dynamic light-scattering experiments were carried out using a VISCO-TEK dynamic light-scattering particle size analyzer with a data-acquisition time of 10 s . 
The hydrodynamic radius was calculated using the omnisize 3 software . 
CD measurements for St SurE were recorded at a protein concentration of 
0.3 mgÆmL ) 1 in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris ( pH 8 ) using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter . 
Urea denaturation experiments were performed by incubating the protein at a concentration of 0.5 mgÆmL ) 1 with varying concentrations of urea ( 0 -- 7 m at 1-m intervals ) . 
After 4 h , far-UV CD-spectra were recorded for these samples . 
Thermal melting studies were carried out using a differential scanning calorimeter VP-DSC 
( Microcal Inc. , Northampton , MA , USA ) . 
The differential scanning calorimetry scan was carried out with the protein in the sample cell at a concentration of 0.5 mgÆmL ) 1 and buffer in the reference cell . 
Data were analyzed using the origin software provided by Microcal Inc. , along with the instrument . 
Crystallization, data collection and processing
Crystallization experiments were carried out with Hampton crystallization screens using the microbatch method with a mixture of silicon and parafﬁn oil in equal proportions layered over the crystallization droplets . 
F222 crystals were obtained under various conditions containing trisodium citrate as the precipitant . 
The crystal used for data collection was obtained with 0.2 m trisodium citrate dihydrate , 0.1 m Hepes ( pH 7.5 ) and 30 % 2-methyl-2 ,4 - pentanediol . 
C2 crystals were produced in the presence of 12 % poly ( ethylene glycol ) 20 000 in 0.1 m Mes ( pH 6.5 ) . 
The crystals were transferred to the crystallization buffer containing 20 % glycerol as the cryoprotectant for a few seconds and then mounted in a cryo-loop . 
X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using a RU300 rotating-anode X-ray generator and a MAR Research ( Hamburg , Germany ) image plate detector system . 
The data sets were processed using denzo and the resulting intensities were scaled using scalepack [ 14 ] . 
Datacollection and processing statistics are given in Table 1 . 
Structure solution and reﬁnement
The structure of the orthorhombic St SurE was determined by molecular replacement with AMoRe [ 15 ] using the atomic coordinates of Tm SurE , which shared 36 % sequence identity with St SurE as the phasing model . 
A dimer of St SurE was used as the search model for the structure solution of the monoclinic form . 
Both structures were reﬁned using refmac5 [ 16 ] . 
The protein models were improved by visual inspection and manual model building using the graphics program coot [ 17 ] . 
The progress of reﬁnement was monitored by calculation of Rfree [ 18 ] using 5 % of the total independent reﬂections that were not included in the reﬁnement . 
Stereochemical qualities of the models were veriﬁed using procheck [ 19 ] . 
Structural analysis
dssp was used to assign the secondary structure of the protein . 
naccess [ 20 ] was used to calculate buried surface areas . 
The program contact from the CCP4 suite was used for the identiﬁcation of intersubunit contacts . 
The pisa [ 21 ] server was used for calculating the solvation free-energy of folding . 
All structural superpositions and the rmsd values for SurE were determined using the program align [ 7 ] . 
The DALI server [ 22 ] was used for homology model searching . 
Average B-factors for protein atoms , water molecules and ligands were calculated using the baverage program of the CCP4 suite . 
Void analysis was carried out using the CASTp server [ 23 ] . 
The ﬁgures were prepared using pymol [ 24 ] . 
The topology diagram was prepared using topdraw [ 25 ] . 
Enzyme activity assays
Phosphatase activity of St SurE was measured against pNPP , a general substrate for all phosphatases . 
pNPP is converted to para-nitrophenol by the phosphatase , the formation of which can be monitored directly at 405 nm . 
Absorbance measurements were carried out on a JASCO UV-visible spectrophotometer model V-530 ( Japan Specroscopic Co. , Japan ) . 
The protein used for assays was dialyzed against 10 mm EDTA to remove the metal ion bound in the active site ( this was identiﬁed in the crystal structure ) . 
The reaction mixture ( 150 lL ) contained 100 mm cac-odylate buffer ( pH 7 ) , 5 -- 10 mm metal , 0.5 -- 40 mm pNPP and 1 -- 20 lg of protein . 
All experiments were replicated three times using a fresh batch of puriﬁed protein and checked for consistency of results . 
The pH dependence of phosphatase activity towards pNPP ( 5 mm ) was determined in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 lg of the enzyme using buffers ( 100 mm ) of varying pH from 4 to 9 ( sodium citrate , pH 4 ; sodium acetate , pH 5 ; CAPSO , pH 6 ; cacodylate ⁄ Hepes , pH 7 ; Tris ⁄ HCl , pH 8 ; and MOPS , pH 9 ) . 
The metal dependence of activity was determined at the optimum pH of 7 ( 100 mm cacodylate buffer , pH 7 ) using various metals ( 10 mm ) , substrate ( pNPP , 5 mm ) and 10 lg of protein . 
For determination of Km and Vmax , the phospha-tase assays contained substrate at concentrations of 0.5 to 40 mm . 
Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear curve ﬁtting to the Lineweaver -- Burk plot using Graphpad prism software .
