RecBCD and RecFOR homologous recombination pathways induced bacterial chromosomal duplication -- segregation by sodium selenite ( SSe ) at sub-inhibitory concentrations . 
This evidence suggests that SSe induces both , double and single DNA strand damage with a concomitant DNA repair response , however the strong dependence for recombinogenic activity of RecB product suggests that the main DNA repair pathway copes with dsDNA breaks . 
A role for SSe recombinogenic induction is proposed to explain its effect on DNA instability .

Introduction 
nium ( Se ) , an essential and toxic trace element [ 1 ] ; the salt is water-soluble and easily taken up by organisms and it is used as a chemopreventive component in multivitaminic preparations . 
SSe is an essential component of several major metabolic pathways , including thyroid hormone metabolism , antioxidant defense systems , and immune function [ 2 ] . 
The reported inverse correlation between selenium intake in the diet and human mortality caused by cancer raised interest in this substance as an anticarcinogenic/antimutagenic agent [ 3 -- 7 ] . 
In contrast , some short-test systems used for the detection of DNA-damaging agents [ 8,9 ] showed that SSe has carcinogenic/mutagenic activity and further investigations aimed to understand the metabolic basis of its anticarcinogenic capabilities were undertaken . 
The discovery that the four glutathione peroxidase enzymes ( classical GPx1 , gastrointestinal GPx2 , plasmatic GPx3 , phospholipid hydroperoxSodium selenite ( Na2SeO3 ) is a typical compound of sele ¬

ide GPx4 ) and thioredoxin reductase are selenoproteins [ 10 -- 13 ] , led to the proposition of models in which SSe antimutagenic effects are mediated through the maintenance of the cell redox balance ; these models however have several ﬂaws for example synthetic Se-compounds as benzylselenocyanate , 1,4-phenylene - ( methylene ) selenocyanate , selenobetaine , methylselenocysteine , and some aliphatic selenocyanates display antitumorigenic activities , even though several of them are not efﬁcient sources of SSe for the synthesis of GPxs , additionally , antitumorigenic effects of SSe have been consistently associated with supra-nutritional levels of the element , like the dose of 1 mg SSe/Kg in the diet or ca. 0.7 mg SSe/L in drinking water , 10 times the dose required to prevent clinical signs of SSe deﬁciency and more than double the requirement for maximal expression of GPxs commonly used as the physiological marker of SSe availability [ 14 ] . 
On the other hand , SSe concentrations from 0.01 to 10 mg/mL , induced a 1.5-fold increase in sister-chromatid exchanges and a 1.9 -- 3.9-fold increase in micronuclei frequency [ 9,15 ] , as well as unscheduled DNA repair synthesis and chromosome aberrations [ 16 -- 18 ] , furthermore it is well documented that the Rec − bacterial strains as Bacillus subtilis or Salmonella enterica as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have an increased sensitivity to Se [ 19 -- 22 ] , and it has recently been described the ability of this compound to generate DNA breaks and frameshifts by 1 -- 4 bp deletions [ 23 ] ; all this evidence suggests that the DNA repair capacity of the cell is important in the response to SSe exposure , and it is expected to be involved in other functions , some of them related to the observed antitumorigenic activity i vitro and in vivo [ 2,14 ] Letavayová et al. described the DNA damage produced during exposure to SSe , and presented strong evidence that it consists on double strand DNA breakage and depends on homolougus recombination for repair [ 22 ] . 
damage repair and the mechanisms by which SSe affects DNA stability , we evaluated the effect of sodium selenite on the seggregation of a chromosomal duplication on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , comprising the segment from leuA to nadC genes . 
The recombinogenic events in this assay act on substrates generated in the intact bacterium by endogenous processes , the recombinants scored arise mainly by a single intramolecular nonreciprocal exchange between direct chromosomal repeats without the selection for rare recombinant genotypes or the participation of bacteriophage or plasmid functions present in sexual exchanges . 
dent homologous recombination pathways , are involved in the sodium selenite ( SSe ) induced bacterial chromosomal duplication -- segregation . 
After exposure to SSe double and single DNA strand breaks are produced , however , the strong dependence for the recombinogenic activity of RecB suggests that either the main DNA damage produced dsDNA breaks or , in order to repair the DNA damage , the dsDNA is generated as a second recombinogenic substrate from a former DNA damage like ssDNA or stalled forks . 
In order to understand the Rec pathways involved in SSe induced Our results suggest that both , the RecBCD and RecFOR depen ¬

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Growth media
NaCl ( 5 g/L ) . 
Solid medium contained Merk agar at 1.5 % . 
Phage plates used to score plaque morphologies contained 1 % Bacto tryptone ( Difco ) , 0.8 % NaCl and 1.2 % agar or 0.7 % for phage top agar . 
MacConkey Agar Base ( 40 g/L , Difco ) was supplemented with 1 % lactose.AntibioticsandsodiumselenitewerepurchasedfromSigmaChemical , Co. . 
Final concentrations of antibiotics were as follows : sodium ampicilin ( Ap ) 30 g/mL for single-copy elements ( MudA ) chloramphenicol ( Cm ) 20 g/mL , tetracycline hydrochloride ( Tc ) 20 g/mL , kanamycin sulfate ( Km ) 50 g/m L . 
The chromogenic gal ) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 40 g/mL . 
All incubations were at 37 ◦ C. Sterile 0.85 % NaCl ( saline ) was used to dilute cultures . 
The complex medium used was nutrient broth NB ( 8 g/L , Difco Laboratories ) with - galactosidase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ( X ¬

enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ) are listed in Table 1 . 
The duplication -- segregation assay uses strains bearing a duplicated chromosomal region ﬂanking a MudA element , a transposition-defective derivative of Mu [ 24 ] located at the joint point of the duplications , that carries an ampicillin-resistance ( ApR ) determinant and the lacZYA ( Lac + ) genes transcriptionally fused to an adjacent chromosomal promoter . 
An exchange between the direct-order chromosomal repeats results in the segregation of haploid recombinants that lost the join-point markers , these recombinants are Lac − and ApS . 
These segregations occurred spontaneously , presumably induced by endogenous initiating DNA lesions , however , the presence of ampicilin in the medium selects against those recombinants and only in its absence the duplicant-segregant populations appear . 
Three duplications were used : DUP1731 [ ( leuA1179 ) * MudA * ( nadC220 ) ] , DUP1732 [ ( pyrB2694 ) * MudA * ( thr-469 ) ] and Genotypes of the bacterial strains used in this work ( all derivatives of Salmonella 
DUP1733 [ ( trp-2482 ) * MudA * ( his-9955 ) ] ; they have 0.7 ′ ( 36.2 Kbp ) , 3.1 ′ ( 152.7 Kbp ) , and 6.7 ′ ( 335.5 Kbp ) chromosomal duplication length , respectively . 
The recBCD phenotype was determined by phage-plaque morphology with P22 and P22 327 ( abc1 abc2 ) h21 c2-5 [ 25,26 ] , supplied by N. Benson . 
All the `` TT '' and `` TG '' strains were kindly provided by J. R. Roth and by T. Galitski . 
2.3. Genetic techniques
Transductional crosses were mediated by the high-frequency generalized phage mutant P22 HT105/1 int-201 [ 27 ] . 
Transductants were single colony puriﬁed and made phage-free by streaking on non-selective green indicator plates [ 28 ] . 
Cross-streaking to check phage sensitivity was done with a P22 clear-plaque mutant , H5 . 
Methods for preparing P22 transducing lysates were described previously [ 29 ] . 
2.4. mdaA disruption
Insertion of the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element in the mdaA gene was isolated by transducing the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element ( from strain TT18797 ) into a recipient strain expressing Tn10 transposase from plasmid pNK2881 [ 30,31 ] . 
Insertion of the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element was isolated as Tetracycline resistant ( TcR ) and the search of transposon insertions in the nitroreductase genes was done selecting 25 g/mL nitrofurantoine resistants ( NfR ) ( from 10 g/mL in the wild type ) . 
The mdaA : : Tn10d ( TPOP2 ) insertion was mapped by PCR and transduced from RC1378 into TT18931 resulting in the RC1466 strain . 
A decreased nitroreductase activity with nitrofurantoine as substrate was determined for the strain RC1378 [ 32 ] . 
2.5. Determination of Tn10d(T-POP2) insertion site
The mapping and physical determination was done using the same methodology as described previously [ 30 ] . 
Sequences adjacent to the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) insertion in the mdaA gene were ampliﬁed by single-primer PCR done under low-stringency conditions ( 4 cycles of 1 min at 94 ◦ C , 1 min at 45 ◦ C , and 45 min at 72 ◦ C ; Idaho Technologies Thermocycler ) . 
Internal , outward-directed primers speciﬁc to each side of the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element were used individually for this initial PCR . 
PCR products having one end point within the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element were identiﬁed by comparison with the bands produced with templated DNA from an isogenic strain lacking the Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) element . 
The unique PCR products were excised from the gel and let them to diffuse into water . 
Sequences were reampliﬁed by high-stringency PCR with a nested primer within Tn10d ( T-POP2 ) used in 100-fold excess with the original primer used for single-primer PCR . 
The ﬁnal , somewhat-smaller PCR product was puriﬁed with the QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit , and sequenced in an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer PE Applied Biosystems .

Haploid ( Lac − ApS ) recombinant clones form white sectors within the blue background of the Lac + colony . 
Twenty single colonies were suspended in saline solution and appropriate dilutions were spread on NB X-gal 40 g/mL plates and incubated for 2 days . 
The number of white colonies ( Lac − ) and blue colonies ( Lac + ) was determined using the AccuCount 1000 of BioLogics . 
The Lac − segregant frequency of each culture is the ratio of Lac − colonies to total colonies ( segregants/total quency to avoid disproportionate contributions by `` jackpots '' . 
With the ﬁnal number of cells per colony and assuming that each colony arose from a single cell the number of generations was calculated . 
Segregation rate is calculated using the equation : q = 1 − ( 1 − M ) 1/n , where q is the frequency of the events/cell/generation , `` n '' is the number of cellular divisions and `` M '' frequency of mutants on the plate ( U. Bergthorsson , personal communication ) . 
tration of 30 g/mL , started from a single colony , was diluted 1:50 in fresh NB liquid media supplemented with ampicilin and incubated at 37 ◦ C to reach mid log growth at optical density ( O.D. ) 600 nm = 0.4 ; at this O.D. the cells were diluted to start 20 independent 14 h cultures with 1 × 103 cells in 200 L each one , without ampicilin selection , in the presence of sodium selenite or nitrofurantoine . 
Full density cultures were diluted at the appropriate concentration and plated on NB X-gal medium to count colony forming units ( cfu ) . 
White colonies without blue sectors corresponded to segregants formed in the NB broth before plating . 
To calculate the proportion of mutants in each culture , the plates were incubated at 37 ◦ C during 24 h , and the total number of colonies and mutants were counted ( number of lac − colonies divided by the total number of colonies ) . 
For each strain assayed , an overnight culture with NB and Ap at a ﬁnal concen ¬

2.8. Estimation of mutation rates
tion of mutant colonies obtained in each culture was multiplied by the mean total number of colonies of the 20 independent cultures , and by the dilution factor . 
ing the test , we used the maximum likelihood method [ 33 -- 35 ] which uses all the experimental data obtained , i.e. the number of mutants observed in each independent culture ( ri ) . 
The maximum likelihood estimator m satisﬁed equation 50 in Lea and Coulson 's paper [ 33 ] : ∑ To estimate the number of mutants ( ri ) minimizing sampling error , the proporTo obtain a reliable estimator of the number of mutations ( m ) that occurred dur-N [ xi ( xi + 2.02 ) 2d + xi ( xi + 2.02 ) − 2 ( xi + 2.02 ) d − 1 ] = 0 
i = 1 
where d = ( 1 − 4.5 + ln m ) 
and x = 11.6 11.6 ( ) i − 2.02 ri/m − ln m + 4.5 
To obtain a ﬁrst approximated value for m to use in the above equations , we calculated the median number of mutants ( r0 ) from the 20 cultures , and then used the relation r0/m0 − ln m0 = 1.24 ( equation 27 of Lea and Coulson ) . 
This is not a linear relation so an expression for m0 can not be directly calculated , but its value was calculated by trial . 
Next , the equations were recalculated with values adjacent to m0 until we got , by trial , the m which made the sum equal to zero ( or closer to zero , as wanted ) . 
This is the maximum likelihood estimator of the expected number of mutations in the experiment . 
Variance of m was calculated using equation 53 in Lea and Coulson 's paper : 
s2 = 1 m2 
m N [ d2 ( 64.454 ) + d ( 36.685 ) + 6.08 ] 
To calculate ( mutation rate per cell per generation ) the m obtained was divided by the ﬁnal number of cells in the culture minus the initial number of cells seeded [ 36 ] . 
The standard deviation of m would be the square root of s2m divided by the ﬁnal number of cells in the culture minus the initial number of seeded cells . 
Using the central limit theorem of statistics stating that the sum of n independent identically distributedboundrandomvariablesapproachesanormaldistribution , wecalculated the 99 % conﬁdence intervals ( CI99 % ) for each estimate ( m ± 3 sm ) . 
Non-overlapping intervals were considered statistically different . 
3. Results
3.1. Selection of the duplication–segregation system
ferent chromosomal duplication intervals were tested using the colony-sectoring recombination screen method for Nf segregation induction on DUP1733 , DUP1732 and DUP1731 . 
DUP1733 carries a chromosomal duplication of 6.7 min ca. 335.5 kbp ; it encompasses the region from trp at 38 ′ to his at 44.8 ′ . 
The segregation of this duplication presented a high basal recombination level making it difﬁcult to distinguish between the control and the Nf effect ( Fig. 1a ) . 
DUP1732 is 3.1 min length , ca. 152.7 Kbp from pyrB 96.9 ′ to thr 100 ′ / 0 ′ , it presented lower background but the response to Nf was too high , making it difﬁcult to control the induction of rearrangements ( Fig. 1b ) . 
On the other hand , DUP1731 had a clear induction of the segregation without the extreme response In order to optimize the experiments of segregation , three dif-of DUP1732 or the high background of DUP1733 ( Fig. 1c ) . 
DUP1731 is 0.7 ′ of length and it expands from leuA 2.9 ′ to nadC 3.6 ′ loci ca. 36.2 Kbp , we selected this duplication for the experiments with SSe , however , the DUP1732 was also used to determine the effect of SSe and Nf in the corresponding wild-type strain . 
3.2. Duplication–segregation is dependent of endogenous DNA damage
To test if the duplication -- segregation system was sensing the endogenously induced DNA damage or was it detecting the effect of any experimental manipulation , we tested the genotoxic action of metabolites resulting from the nitroactivation of Nf as an internal control . 
We inserted a T-POP2 element ( a Tn10dTet derivative ) into mdaA which encodes for a nitroreductase involved in the metabolic activation of Nf [ 37 ] , we used the colony-sectoring recombination screening method . 
Recently we had reported that the nitroactivation of Nf is lowered in the mdaA strain [ 32 ] , in the same way we determined that the duplication -- segregation induction was also lowered , conﬁrming the reliability of the system to evaluate internal metabolism of xenobiotic compounds ( Fig. 2 ) . 
3.3. Determination of SSe and Nf minimal inhibitory concentrations
for the wild type , recB503 ( recB ) , recF521 ( recF ) , the double mutant recB503 recF521 DUP1731 and the wild-type DUP1732 strains , respectively . 
Similar experiments were done with Nf and 0.5 g/mL was selected as the tolerance-dose . 
Cultures of more than 12 h Log growing cultures were used for the experiments at 0.5 optical densities ( O.D. ) corresponding to 108 CFU/mL . 
Sodium selenite is toxic at high doses , hence 10 g/mL was chosen as the maximal dose since at this concentration the growth curve of the bacterial culture was affected by less than 10 % , we considered it to be the tolerance-dose ; 50 g/mL importantly affected growth and we refer to it as the toxic-dose . 
The minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MIC ) were 3500 , 300 , 3500 , 250 and 2400 g/mL showed that 10 g/mL of sodium selenite or 0.5 g/mL of Nf did not signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁnal CFU/mL , with the exception of the double mutant recB recF strain , where Nf 0.05 g/mL was selected as the exposure concentration . 
DUP1731 strains : wild type , recB , recF , and the double mutant recB recF , respectively and NF 5 g/mL for the DUP1732 wild type ; the toxic-dose was deﬁned in 10 , 1 , 2.5 0.5 and 5 g/mL , respectively ; and MIC for each one of the strains was 20 , 2 , 15 , 0.3 and 8 g/mL , respectively . 
The double rec - mutant had an increased sensibility to Nf as was expected since homologous pathways had been seriously affected . 
The Nf tolerance-dose was 5 , 0.5 , 1 and 0.05 g/mL for the

3.4. Fluctuation test
toxic concentrations of SSe to amplify the mutagenic rates . 
This produces a great number of mutants in the cultures , and practically no cultures without mutants are obtained in the ﬂuctuation analysis . 
So , calculation of mutational rates ( ) using the simple technique of counting cultures without mutants ( P0 estimator ) would not be reliable ; it would be better to estimate by the maximal likelihood method . 
We used the distribution and the maximal likelihood method for large counts as proposed by Lea and Coulson . 
The assumption made in these models is that mutations can be treated as a stochastic process where : ( a ) the probability that a mutation will take place in the short interval between time t and t + dt is independent of what may occur at other periods , ( b ) the conditional probability , p ( n | t ) , that a mutation will yield a count of n mutant colonies , given that it occurred at time t , depends on t , but not on what may happen at other times ; ( c ) the mutants grow at about the same rate as the original cells and ( d ) cell division is not synchronized [ 36 ] . 
It is quite reasonable that these assumptions are valid in the present experiments . 
Our results were also veriﬁed by computer simulation , available at request . 
The recombination assay used in this work allows the use of non ¬ 
3.5. Effect of SSe on the duplication–segregation assay
segregation were determined in four strains bearing the DUP1731 : wild type having 5.6 × 10 − 3 mutations per cell per generation ( 99 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) : 5.3 × 10 − 3 -- 6.0 × 10 − 3 ) , recB − 3.4 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 3.2 × 10 − 3 -- 3.6 × 10 − 3 ) , recF − strain 4.8 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 4.5 × 10 − 3 -- 5.1 × 10 − 3 ) and the double mutant recB-recF - 0.24 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 0.225 × 10 − 3 -- 0.27 × 10 − 3 ) , respectively ( Fig. 3a ) . 
This shows that both , RecFOR and RecBCD pathways are involved on the spontaneous chromosomal rearFrequencies of spontaneous chromosomal duplication -- rangement . 
In the presence of 5 g/mL of SSe these frequencies were modiﬁed : wt , 9.0 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 8.5 × 10 − 3 -- 9.6 × 10 − 3 ) , recB − , 2.8 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 2.6 × 10 − 3 -- 3.0 × 10 − 3 ) , recF − 6.8 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 6.3 × 10 − 3 -- 7.2 × 10 − 3 ) , recB - recF - 0.621 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 0.56 × 10 − 3 -- 0.67 × 10 − 3 ) ( Fig. 3b ) . 
At doses of 10 g/mL of SSe the differential recombination between strains is reproduced : wt 13.4 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 12.6 × 10 − 3 -- 14.2 × 10 − 3 ) ; recB − 3.0 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 2.9 × 10 − 3 -- 3.3 × 10 − 3 ) ; recF − 10.3 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 9.6 × 10 − 3 -- 10.9 × 10 − 3 ) ; recB - recF - 0.40 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 0.36 × 10 − 3 -- 0.44 × 10 − 3 ) ( Fig. 3c ) . 
The wt strain had the strongest response to SSe recombination induction while the recB strain remained without changes ( Fig. 3b and c ) , a strong evidence that this response is RecBCD pathway-dependent . 
Since the recF mutation produced a lower response than the wt , the RecFOR pathway seems to be also involved in the response , although in a minor participation compared with the RecBCD pathway . 
The nitro compound Nf , a strong inducer of free radicals and DNA-adducts , was used as a positive control of the recombination induction ; 0.5 g/mL of Nf generated a clear response : wt 10.7 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 10.1 × 10 − 3 -- 11.3 × 10 − 3 ) , recB 9.9 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 9.3 × 10 − 3 -- 10.6 × 10 − 3 ) and recF 37.3 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 35.2 × 10 − 3 -- 39.5 × 10 − 3 ) ; due to the sensibility of the double mutant to Nf the experiments on this strain were carried out with 0.05 g/mL , recB - recF - 1.35 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 1.24 × 10 − 3 -- 1.46 × 10 − 3 ) mutations per cell per generation , respectively ( Fig. 3d ) . 
As expected , Nf increased recombination in a wt background , however in opposition to the SSe stimulus , recF strain in the presence of Nf showed a strong recombination induction ( Fig. 3d ) as well . 
Nf and SSe are inducing two different kinds of DNA damage and therefore , a different recombinogenic response . 
The simultaneous presence of Nf and SSe had an additive effect on the induction of segregation in the wt strain 15.6 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 14.8 × 10 − 3 -- 16.6 × 10 − 3 ) but not in the recB 10.8 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 10.1 × 10 − 3 -- 11.4 × 10 − 3 ) or recF mutants 32.7 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 30.7 × 10 − 3 -- 34.7 × 10 − 3 ) and neither in the double mutant recB-recF - 1.00 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 0.91 × 10 − 3 -- 1.09 × 10 − 3 ) , using 10 and 0.05 g/mL , respectively of SSe and Nf ( Fig. 3e ) . 
The RecBCD pathway is required to have an effect by SSe , but not for the Nf induction . 
The frequency of spontaneous chromosomal duplication -- segregation was also determined in the wild-type strain DUP1732 , controls having 7.89 × 10 − 3 mutations per cell per generation ( 99 % CI : 7.42 × 10 − 3 -- 8.36 × 10 − 3 ) , in the presence of 5 g/mL of SSe 6.36 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 5.96 × 10 − 3 -- 6.76 × 10 − 3 ) , with 10 g/mL of Se 6.02 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 5.64 × 10 − 3 -- 6.41 × 10 − 3 ) , in the presence of 0.5 g/mL of Nf 16.3 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 15.3 × 10 − 3 -- 17.2 × 10 − 3 ) , with 10 g/mL of SSe and 0.5 g/mL of Nf 13.3 × 10 − 3 ( 99 % CI : 12.5 × 10 − 3 -- 14.0 × 10 − 3 ) . 
4. Discussion
A broad group of xenobiotic compounds , nitrofurantoine ( Nf ) among them , are genotoxic via their intercalation into the double helix , by adduct formation and/or by producing free-radicals that induce single and double-strand breaks [ 38 -- 41 ] . 
These DNA insults can be repaired by several mechanisms , one of them , probably the most important , involves homologous recombination between sister chromatids . 
These recombinogenic events in Salmonella enterica are RecBCD and RecFOR pathways dependent [ 42 ] . 
Repair of single and double strand DNA lesions through sister-chromatid exchanges , probably represents the most frequent event involving homologous recombination . 
Most of the studies on bacterial recombination revealed the existence of a major and a minor pathway dependent on RecBCD or RecFOR functions , respectively , however the expression of a relevant phenotype of the RecFOR pathway on sexual recombinogenic assays requires a triple mutant background , recBC , sbcB and sbcC otherwise , in a wild-type background RecFOR pathway is responsible for only 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 of the total events . 
The studies on bacterial recombination were usually done using sexual assays [ 43 ] , having in common the introduction of foreign DNA with double-strand ends or substrates ready to be processed to double-strand breaks . 
The duplication -- segregation assay used in the present study makes it possible to observe homologous recombination between direct repeats of a chromosomal segment . 
On this assay the RecFOR pathway is not a minor component but it is as important as the RecBCD pathway . 
It has been proposed that the RecBCD pathway uses the double DNA strand ends to initiate the recombinogenic events , while the RecFOR pathway uses single-strand gaps as substrate [ 42 ] . 
enterica Serovar Typhimurium are a common phenomenon , frequencies fall in the range of 10 − 4 to 10 − 3 for most loci . 
In this system , recombining enzymes and sequences are present in the intact bacterium , starting from endogenous substrates ( single-strand gaps , double-strand breaks , etc. ) without bacteriophage or plasmid functions . 
Under these circumstances , it would be expected that xenobiotic compounds capable of inducing DNA damage could increase the duplication -- segregation frequencies of the chromosome . 
In this study , three different bacterial chromosomal duplications were tested for induction of recombination by Nf , one of them , DUP1731 , presented the most reproducible and accurate response and therefore it was selected to determine the effect of the sodium selenite on the bacterial chromosome stability . 
is one of the two genes that codify for the classical nitroreductases on Salmonella whose product is necessary to activate Nf . 
Results obtained with the mdaA mutated strain strongly suggest that the induction of chromosomal duplication -- segregation was dependent on the endogenous DNA damage produced by the metabolized antibiotic . 
Furthermore , the spontaneous rearrangements were decreased by this mutation indicating the existence of endogenous molecules susceptible of nitroreduction [ 32 ] . 
It is important to note that non-toxic doses of sodium selenite ( 5 -- 10 g/mL ) and/or of nitrofurantoine ( 0.5 g/mL ) were used . 
ers of recombination , and together , they showed additive activity . 
This was an unexpected result because SSe anticarcinogenic effects have been associated with the free radical scavenger activity of selenoproteins such as the glutathion peroxidases , therefore , it was expected that the recombinogenic induction by Nf ( a strong free radical inducer ) would be decreased by the presence of SSe [ 41 ] , however this was not observed . 
On the other hand , the recombinogenic activity of SSe is consistent with the induction of sister-chromatid exchanges and the DNA repair synthesis reported in eukaryotic cells or the increased sensitivity to SSe toxicity in prokaryotic Rec − cells . 
These events can be explained by the observation that selenium compounds can also exert oxidative stress [ 44 -- 47 ] . 
The homologous recombination pathways are among the major repair systems used to cope with pre-cancerous lesions arising from DNA insults [ 48,49 ] ; in this context , the induction by SSe of duplication -- segregation events observed in the bacterial chromosome could reﬂect some of the complex mechanisms involved in the proposed mechanisms of cancer protection by SSe [ 22,42 ] . 
However , at the same time , high levels of recombination can be considered as pro-carcinogenic processes . 
observed in the wild type . 
On recB cells , SSe was not able to induce the recombinogenic events but Nf remained as a strong inducer as it was in the wild-type background ; therefore , there is a substantial difference between the DNA rearrangement mechanisms invoked by SSe or Nf . 
It is possible that in the recB strain SSe made an initial DNA damage that was repaired before the chromosomal rearrangement occurred . 
This would imply that the RecBCD On the other hand , chromosomal duplications in Salmonella By inserting a mobile element , a mdaA disruption was made ; this In a wild-type strain , both Nf or SSe acted as strong inducThe response to SSe on recB cells was different to the one homolougus recombination ( having double DNA strand breaks as substrate ) is the mayor pathway for the DNA rearrangement mechanisms induced by SSe , but not for those induced by Nf . 
On the same way , the additive effect of SSe in the presence of Nf also required the RecBCD pathway , otherwise the induction of Nf would be independent of SSe . 
In the absence of the RecBCD pathway , RecFOR is involved in the Nf but not in the SSe induction . 
However , in the presence of RecBCD the RecFOR operates during the SSe induction of the rearrangement . 
A recF background was used for the segregation experiments to study the contribution of the RecFOR pathway on the recombinogenic induction by SSe . 
An increased recombination frequency of 0.7 times the induction of the control was found ( using both concentrations 5 and 10 g/mL of sodium selenite ) , without the inhibition observed with recB . 
This could be explained by the overlapping of the RecBCD and RecFOR pathways where RecBCD would be epistatic . 
On the other hand , a strong induction of seven times over the basal recombinogenic activity was observed in the presence of Nf . 
We interpreted this result by assuming that some of the DNA damage induced by Nf ( probably stalled forks or DNA-gaps ) can be repaired by the RecFOR pathway [ 50 ] , but in its absence the DNA damage induced by Nf is processed and recruited as double DNA strand breaks by RecBCD , thus increasing the frequency of the duplication -- segregation events [ 50 -- 52 ] . 
The overall frequency of DUP1732 segregants was similar to the DUP1731 strain with variations in the response to 5 and 10 g/mL SSe where the response was the same , response to Nf was similar to the one observed in DUP1731 . 
Different frequencies of chromosomal deletions are reported depending on the nature of the assay used ( Figs. 1 -- 3 ) . 
The colonysectoring method is a qualitative approach in which the bacterial cells grow in a solid support , while for the quantitative ﬂuctuation test the bacterial cells are grown in liquid medium and , the maximal likelihood method takes into account each value and not only the median of the segregants as in the qualitative approach . 
We consider that the maximal likelihood method is a more quantitative and reliable way to determine the frequencies of chromosome deletions . 
This investigation revealed that SSe and Nf induce DNA damage via the intervention of two different mechanisms and that SSe is a strong inducer of recombinogenic rearrangements in the intact cell . 
The fact that SSe is an inducer of homologous recombination should be considered to explain its dual activity : their anticancer/antimutagenic capacity as well as its ability to provoke DNA instability and its carcinogenic/mutagenic activity .
