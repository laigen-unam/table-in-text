Analysis of Chicken TLR4, CD28, MIF, MD-2, and LITAF Genes in a Salmonella enteritidis Resource Population
ABSTRACT Salmonella enteritidis is a foodborne patho-gen that negatively affects both animal and human health . 
Genetic variations in response to pathogenic SE colonization or to SE vaccination were measured in a chicken resource population . 
Outbred broiler sires and 3 diverse , highly inbred dam lines produced 508 F progeny that 1 were evaluated for either bacterial colonization after pathogenic SE inoculation or circulating antibody level after SE vaccination . 
Five candidate genes were selected for study , based on their biological function as possibly affecting response to SE : toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , T-cell specific surface protein ( CD28 ) , macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) , MD-2 , and lipopolysaccharide ¬

INTRODUCTION
One of the most important aspects of food animal production and processing is avoiding contamination of the food chain with pathogenic organisms . 
Salmonella enteriti-dis is a bacterium that can infect poultry and is the single most common cause of food poisoning cases in the United States ( Rodrigue et al. , 1997 ) . 
The use of antibiotics in domestic livestock has been questioned due to the possible creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the possibility of antibiotic residues being consumed by humans ( White et al. , 2001 ) . 
Genetic approaches to improve the innate resistance of the chicken to SE could lead to useful solutions to control infection in poultry and would thereby reduce food poisoning in humans without increased use of antibiotics . 
The candidate gene approach is a strategy by which genes of interest controlling a particular trait can be identified ( Rothschild , 1997 ) . 
The hypothesis used in this approach is that candidate genes represent a large proportion of the quantitative trait loci that determine a particular trait ( Rothschild , 1997 ) . 
Candidate gene re-induced tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α factor ( LITAF ) . 
Gene fragments were sequenced from the founder lines of the resource population . 
The LITAF and MIF genes were homozygous for all sires . 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) were identified in 3 genes ( TLR4 , CD28 , and MD-2 ) and were used to test for associations of sire SNP with SE response . 
Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses . 
The CD28 broiler sire SNP was associated with both bacterial load in the cecum ( P < 0.003 ) and vaccine antibody response ( P < 0.05 ) . 
The MD-2 SNP was associated ( P < 0.04 ) with the bacterial load in the spleen . 
The use of these SNP in these genes in marker-assisted selection may result in enhancement of disease resistance . 
search has been conducted on numerous genes that control the response to SE by the host cell , including MHC Class I , MHC Class II , Caspase-1 , Inhibitor of Apoptosis Pro-tein-1 , Prosaposin , SAL1 , NRAMP1 , TNC , IAP-1 , TGFβ2 , TGFβ3 , IgL , and INOS ( Hu et al. , 1997 ; Mariani et al. , 2001 ; Lamont et al. , 2002 ; Liu et al. , 2002 , 2003 ; Liu and Lamont , 2003 ; Malek and Lamont , 2003 ; Kramer et al. , 2003 ) . 
Five new candidate genes were selected , based on their critical and interrelated roles in host response to intracellular bacteria , to study the genetic control of chicken response to SE . 
The toll-like receptor ( TLR ) family provides a critical link between immune stimulants produced by bacteria and the initiation of host defense . 
Shimazu et al. ( 1999 ) identified that TLR4 requires an additional molecule , MD-2 , for effective lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) recognition . 
For infections with gram-negative bacteria such as SE , LPS is a major source of inflammation , and TLR4 is crucial in mediating the effects of LPS . 
Lipopolysaccharide on the cell surface of bacteria interacts with CD14 on the surface of macrophages , which in turn provides a signal to the TLR4/MD -2 complex ( Akashi , 2001 ) . 
This pathway leads 
Abbreviation Key : CD28 = T-cell specific surface protein ; LITAF = lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α factor ; LPS = lipopolysaccharide ; MD-2 = protein MD-2 ; MIF = macrophage migration inhibitory factor ; SNP = single nucleotide polymorphism ; TLR4 = toll-like receptor 4 ; TNF = tumor necrosis factor . 
to the transcription of immune response genes against Salmonella . 
The MD2 protein is essential for the correct intracellular distribution , cell surface expression , and LPS recognition of TLR4 ( Nagai et al. , 2002 ) . 
Dil and Qureshi ( 2002b , 2003 ) demonstrated TLR4 to be required for LPS-mediated iNOS induction in chicken macrophages . 
The relative number of TLR4 receptor molecules on the macro-phage surface varies between chicken strains , thereby varying the expression of LPS binding receptors among strains ( Dil and Qureshi , 2002a ) . 
Two separate linkage analysis studies provide evidence that TLR4 in chickens is associated with response to Salmonella ( Beaumont et al. , 2003 ; Leveque , et al. , 2003 ) . 
The CD28 is a transmembrane protein found on most mature T cells , which is critical for T-cell activation . 
Mice lacking CD28 exhibit immune system defects consistent with disrupted T-cell function ( Rebhan et al. , 1997 ) . 
CD28 also induces cell proliferation and cytokine production and promotes T-cell survival . 
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) is a mac-rophage cytokine and an important mediator of inflammation ( Bernhagen et al. , 1993 ; Calandra et al. , 1998 ) . 
Koebernick et al. ( 2002 ) showed that MIF-deficient knockout mice failed to control an infection with wild-type Salmonella typhimurium . 
Roger et al. ( 2001 ) reported that MIF is important in the recognition of LPS and gramnegative bacteria by cells of the innate immune system by modulating the expression of TLR4 . 
The MIF enhances production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor ne-crosis factor ( TNF ) - α and facilitates the initiation of the host defense response . 
Lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α factor ( LITAF ) is a novel protein binding to a critical region of the TNF-α promoter and is reported to be involved in activation of TNF-α expression during LPS induction ( Takashiba et al. , 1995 ; Myokai et al. , 1999 ) . 
To date , there has not been any report on the function of LITAF in poultry . 
However , the gene has been recently mapped to Gga 14 ( J. M. Goodenbour , J. T. Hynes , and S. J. Lamont , unpublished data ) . 
The specific objective of this study was to analyze new candidate genes for Salmonella response in poultry . 
This work contributes to the overall goal to identify DNA markers for phenotypic variation in response to bacteria .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Animals
The first filial (F ) generation of the Iowa 1 Salmonella
response resource population ( ISRRP ) of chickens was used . 
The F1 generation was produced in 5 hatches by crossing 4 outbred males of a broiler breeder male line 
ALMONELLA RESISTANCE 545 ( Kaiser and Lamont , 2002 ) with dams of 3 highly inbred dam lines : 1 Fayoumi and 2 MHC-congenic Leghorn lines ( G-B1 and G-B2 ) with inbreeding coefficients of 99 % ( Zhou and Lamont , 1999 ) . 
These inbred lines have been used in studies of immune response and disease resistance ( Maccubbin and Schierman , 1986 ; DiFronzo and Schierman , 1989 ; Lamont et al. , 1992 ; Lakshmanan et al. , 1996 ) . 
The genetic distance between the parental lines maximized the feasibility of finding molecular genetic polymorphisms , and the inbred nature of the dams meant that they consistently contributed the same allele to all offspring , thus allowing a focus on the effects of the sire allele in the F1 generation . 
Salmonella Pathogenic Challenge and Quantification of Bacterial Load
The F1 chicks ( n = 194 ) from 3 hatches were intraesopha-geally inoculated at 1 d of age with pathogenic SE ( Kaiser et al. , 2002 ) . 
Half of the birds each were euthanized at 6 or 7 d of age . 
The SE culture and quantification procedures were previously described ( Kaiser and Lamont , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella Vaccination and Antibody Measurement
Chicks ( n = 314 ) from 2 hatches were injected at 10 d of age with 0.2 mL of commercial bacterin SE vaccine2 for the evaluation of antibody response at 21 d of age . 
Vaccination and ELISA procedures to quantify SE vaccine antibody levels were previously described ( Kaiser et al. , 1998 ; Kaiser and Lamont , 2002 ) . 
DNA Isolation, PCR, and Sequencing
Genomic DNA was prepared from erythrocytes by using a standard phenol/chloroform isolation procedure ( Dunnington et al. , 1990 ) . 
To characterize each gene , a pair of primers ( Table 1 ) was developed by using Oligo 5,3 based on the published cDNA sequence of GenBank . 
The PCR reactions were performed in 25-µL reaction volumes containing 25 ng of chicken genomic DNA , 0.8 µM of each primer , 200 µM of each dNTP , 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase ,4 2.5 µL of 10 × PCR reaction buffer , and 1.5 mM MgCl2 . 
The cycling conditions included initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min , followed by 36 cycles at 93 °C for 45 s , optimum annealing temperature and optimal annealing time ( Table 1 ) , 72 °C for 1 min , and final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C . 
The PCR products were purified using a MICROCON centrifugal filter .5 An ABI 377 sequencer6 was used for direct sequencing using dye terminators . 
Each PCR product was sequenced at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility .

N. 
For polymorphism characterization of each gene , one genomic DNA sample of broiler , Leghorn G-B1 and G ¬ 
B2 , and Fayoumi was sequenced using both direction primers ( total n = 8 sequences ) . 
Sequencher software7 was used to assemble the sequences and identify polymorphisms . 
The restriction enzyme sites for each gene were detected by using a sequence analysis web server ( Webcutter2 .08 ) . 
The PCR products were digested overnight at 37 °C . 
The digested fragments were separated by electro-phoresis through 2.5 % agarose . 
Ethidium bromide staining was used for DNA visualization . 
Statistical Analysis
A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association between the sire allele of the F1 chicks of the heterozygous sire families and the SE bacterial count using the JMP program ( Sall and Lehman , 2000 ) . 
Model 1 was used for the combined heterozygous sire families for each candidate gene . 
Sire and dam line were taken as fixed effects . 
Both the spleen SE count ( 1.04 × 107 to 3.55 × 109 cfu / mL ) and cecum SE count ( 1.06 × 107 to 5.5 × 108 cfu/mL ) were transformed to their natural logarithms as response variables to achieve a normal distribution of the dependent variables in model construction . 
Model 1: Y = µ + sire allele + sire ijkl i j + dam linek + allele×dam lineik + eijkl,
where Y is defined as the response variable from each ijkl F bird ( natural logarithms of spleen or cecal bacterial 1 count ) . 
A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association between each candidate gene genotype of the F1 chicks of the heterozygous sire families and the SE vaccine antibody level . 
Model 2 was used for the combined heterozygous sire families . 
Sex and ELISA plate factors were included in the statistical model , based on frequent significance in other antibody studies . 
Plate effect , which varied among ELISA assays , was considered a random effect .

Model 2: Yijklmn = µ + sire allelei + sirej + dam linek + sexl + platem (random) + eijklmn,
where Yijklmn is defined as response variables from each F1 bird , ( 1 − S/N ) for antibody level . 
Each gene was analyzed separately , because the inheritance pattern of the alleles indicated that the 5 genes were independent . 
The Bonferonni correction ( Miller , 1981 ) for testing 3 markers would indicate a P-value of 0.05 / 3 or 0.0167 as the threshold for significance . 
RESULTS
Sequence Variation and PCR-RFLP
Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) were identified within TLR4 , CD28 , and MD-2 that affect the recognition sequences for TLR4-Sau96I , CD28-RsaI , and MD-2-AseI restriction enzymes , respectively ( Table 2 ) . 
These enzyme-gene combinations were then used to follow the inheritance of the heterozygous sire alleles in the F1 chicks . 
A primer set ( Table 1 ) was used to amplify a 156-bp fragment of TLR4 gene . 
Sequence analysis revealed one SNP in an intron , a G → C substitution at position 3954 bp in our sequence ( GenBank no : AY064697 ) . 
Broiler sire 8170 was of heterozygous genotype G/C at this position . 
The other 3 broiler sires and the inbred lines were of homozygous genotype G/G . 
The F1 offspring PCR-RFLP resulting from the TLR4-Sau96I digestion of the PCR product produced an undigested PCR product of 156 bp for one allele or of 96 and 60 bp fragments for the other allele . 
For the CD28 gene , a 134-bp fragment amplified from the CD28 gene ( GenBank accession no : Y08823 ) showed a G → T intronic substitution at position 561 for broiler . 
The restriction enzyme RsaI produced fragment sizes of 86 and 48 bp for 2 of the sires ( Table 2 ) . 
The Fayoumi and Leghorn lines had no identified restriction site . 
For the MD-2 gene , the amplified 252-bp product ( GenBank accession no : BI066409 .1 ) showed a G → A synonymous SNP in the Leghorn line to the Fayoumi lines . 
One broiler sire was heterozygous at this site . 
The AseI produced fragment sizes of 174 and 78 bp for the Leghorn lines , whereas the Fayoumi lines had a 252-bp fragment . 
A primer set ( Table 1 ) was used to amplify a 1,062-bp fragment of the MIF gene ( GenBank accession no : M95776 ) . 
Sequencing results revealed a G → T synonymous SNP at position 900 , in the Leghorn line to the Fayoumi lines . 
However , none of the sires were heterozygous for this polymorphism , and therefore this SNP could not be used for association studies . 
Primer ( Table 1 ) was designed from LITAF cDNA ( GenBank accession no : AI979890 ) to amplify 497 bp of the LITAF gene . 
The intronic single nucleotide polymorphism A → T was found in a fragment amplified from genomic DNA . 
The PCR-RFLP of F1 offspring resulting from the LITAF-Hinf I digestion of the PCR product produced an undigested PCR product of 48 and 450 bp fragments for one allele or 48 - , 57 - , and 393-bp fragments for the other allele . 
None of the sires were heterozygous for this SNP .

Association of Candidate Genes with SE Response
The F1 progeny of sires that were heterozygous for each specific gene were genotyped for the corresponding gene SNP . 
Results for the association analysis in the SE population are summarized in Table 3 . 
For the TLR4 gene , the F1 progeny analysis suggested only moderate association ( P < 0.14 ) between the TLR4-Sau96I sire allele and spleen bacterial load ( Table 3 ) . 
There was no association with

For the CD28 gene , the CD28-RsaI sire allele was highly associated ( P < 0.003 ) with SE bacterial load in the cecum ( Table 3 ) . 
There was only moderate association ( P < 0.13 ) between the CD28-RsaI sire allele and spleen bacterial load . 
Effects at P < 0.05 were detected for CD28 on SE vaccine antibody response ( Table 3 ) . 
The MD2-AseI genotype was associated ( P < 0.04 ) with SE bacterial load in spleen and only moderately associated ( P < 0.10 ) in cecum ( Table 3 ) . 
The sire MD-2 allele did not affect antibody level to SE vaccine . 
This is the first report , to our knowledge , of associations between the chromosomal regions marked by CD28 and MD-2 gene polymorphisms and response to SE in chickens . 
DISCUSSION
An increasing amount of evidence indicates the important impact of genetics on modulating the immune response in poultry ( Lamont , 1998 ) . 
By using genetic approaches to improve the innate immune system and minimize the need for use of vaccines or antibodies , it would be possible to control SE in poultry without the hazard of creating antibody-resistant bacteria or residue consumption for humans . 
The 5 candidate genes analyzed in this study are all members of an immunopathway in bacterial infection in poultry . 
They are used by the macrophage in recognition of LPS that is present on the surface of SE and are part of a pathway between recognition of the LPS and transcription of immune response genes in macrophages . 
The TLR4 and CD28 gene polymorphisms were not amino acid substitution sites , suggesting that the causal mutations were elsewhere in the gene or a nearby gene . 
The location of markers associated with traits of interest can be useful for marker-assisted genetic selection and positional cloning work . 
Previous studies ( Lamont et al. , 2002 ; Liu et al. , 2003 ) showed associations of spleen bacterial load with IAP1 and PSAP and also association of spleen and cecum content bacterial load with CASP1 . 
There are reported associations of INOS , IgL , and TRAIL and antibody response with SE vaccine response and bacterial colonization of cecum content and spleen ( Malek and Lamont , 2003 ) .

5 8 MALE Kramer et al. ( 2003 ) demonstrated associations of these genes with SE response in unrelated populations of meattype chickens ( outbred broiler and Dutch Landrace lines ) . 
Leveque et al. ( 2003 ) conducted a linkage study of the TLR4 gene and susceptibility to Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium in chicken . 
They found that the magnitude of the TLR4 effect in the differential resistance or susceptibility of chickens is similar to that observed with NRAMP1 , with TLR4 and NRAMP1 together explaining 35 % of the phenotypic variance . 
In the current study , TLR4 association with spleen bacterial load was moderate ( P < 0.14 ) , and there was no association with bacterial load of cecum content . 
The different genetic effects on bacterial load in cecum and spleen are consistent with a previous report of independent genetic mechanisms for control of bacterial load in spleen or cecum content ( Kai-ser and Lamont , 2001 ) . 
The association of the CD28-Rsa I sire allele with SE bacterial load in cecum content and with circulating antibody response to SE vaccine in the current study may be a result of the key role of CD28 in the biological pathway for processing Salmonella antigens . 
The results of interaction analysis of TLR4 and CD28 genes , which were both heterozygous for sire 8137 , revealed no significant interaction . 
Interestingly , CD28 and NRAMP1 map approximately 22 cM apart in the East Lansing reference population map . 
Liu et al. ( 2003 ) reported that a SNP in NRAMP1 , in the same population as the present study , had an effect on SE antibody level and on spleen bacterial load but that this effect was observed only within offspring of specific sires and dam lines . 
This suggests that the NRAMP1 SNP was in different linkage phase with the causal mutations in the different individual sires and inbred dam lines that founded the resource population . 
In contrast , the CD28 effect extended across the whole resource population , for SE antibody level ( P < 0.003 ) and cecum content bacterial load ( P < 0.05 ) , suggesting a location of the causal mutation closer to the SNP in the CD28 gene than to that in the NRAMP1 gene . 
The MD-2 gene SNP was associated with spleen ( P < 0.04 ) and cecum ( P < 0.10 ) bacterial load . 
This finding , however , was based on a progeny group of only 10 chicks and , therefore , must be interpreted with caution until supported by more observations . 
Because this resource population was generated from a cross between divergent breeds , the F generation is 1 expected to have large linkage disequilibrium intervals . 
To confirm the effects of the gene SNP , advanced intercross generations of the resource population are being produced to study the SNP effects in generations with smaller intervals of linkage disequilibrium . 
New chromosomal regions containing TLR4 , CD28 , and MD-2 polymorphisms with effects on response to Salmo-nella in chickens were identified in this study , which could potentially be used as markers for the phenotypic variation in marker-assisted selection to enhance response to Salmonella . 
Identification of genes in protective pathways of disease resistance will also open possibilities to design specific therapeutic strategies ( e.g. , vaccines ) to match population genotypes for crucial genes .
