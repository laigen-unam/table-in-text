ABSTRACT : Poultry products are an important source of Salmonella enterica . 
An effective way to reduce food poisoning due to Salmonella would be to breed chickens more resistant to infection . 
Unfortunately host responses to Salmonella are complex with many protein source from meat and eggs for most human populations throughout the world . 
Its economic importance has made it the focus of numerous research projects , including a recent effort to sequence the entire chicken genome ( Wicker et al. , 2005 ) . 
Chicken should be used to study Salmonella susceptibility , because in addition to its impact on human health , salmonellosis in young chickens results in economic losses for the poultry industry , amounting to approximately US$ 64 million to US$ 114 million annually in the United States ( Bryan and Doyle , 1995 ) . 
Salmonella enterica is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in humans , mostly caused by poultry products infected by S. enterica serovars Typhimurium or Enteritidis ( Rabsch et al. , 2001 ) . 
Following oral ingestion , Salmonella colonize the intestines and invade the intestinal mucosa . 
In addition to the enteric disease , humans Salmonella serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis are also capable of causing severe systemic disease in newly hatched chicks and in birds under extreme stress conditions . 
The infection seldom causes mortality in birds more than 1 
factors involved . 
To learn more about responses to Salmonella in young chickens of 2 wk old , a cDNA Microarray containing 13,319 probes was performed to compare gene expression proﬁles between two chicken groups under control and Salmonella infected 
conditions . 
Newly hatched chickens were orally infected with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis . 
Since the intestine is one of the important barriers the bacteria encounter after oral inoculation , intestine gene expression was investigated at 2 wk old . 
There were 588 
differentially expressed genes detected , of which 276 were known genes , and of the total number 266 were up-regulated and 322 were down-regulated . 
Differences in gene expression between the two chicken groups were found in control as well as Salmonella infected 
conditions indicating a difference in the intestine development between the two chicken groups which might be linked to the difference in Salmonella susceptibility . 
The differential expressions of 4 genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and the results 
indicated that the expression changes of these genes were generally consistent with the results of GeneChips . 
The ﬁndings in this study have lead to the identiﬁcation of novel genes and possible cellular pathways , which are host dependent .

INTRODUCTION 
The chicken is an important model organism that bridges the evolutionary gap between mammals and other vertebrates ( Hillier et al. , 2004 ) . 
Research on chickens ( Gallus gallus ) has had a significant impact on fundamental biology . 
The domestic chicken also provides a major 
month old ( Suzuki , 1994 ) . 
In young chickens infection with Salmonella leads to diarrhea and intestinal lesions and to an influx of heterophils into the gut accompanied by inflammation and damage to villi ( Barrow et al. , 1987 ) . 
In contrast to other species , no genome-wide expression profiles in the chicken in response to Salmonella have been measured . 
Therefore several processes in the chicken host in response to Salmonella may be unidentified . 
Furthermore validations of the invitro gene expression observations by in vivo data are

In addition it is not known why some chicken lines are more susceptible to Salmonella infections than others ( Barrow et al. , 1987 ; Guillot et al. , 1995 ) . 
Host gene expression responses to a Salmonella infection have widely been studied . 
One of the methods to investigate gene expression responses is the use of GeneChips that allow the analysis of the expression of a large number of genes in a single experiment . 
Indeed , GeneChips have been used to study gene expression responses to Salmonella ( Rosenberger et al. , 2001 ) . 
With this approach it was found that in human epithelial cells cultures Salmonella typhimurium induce a classical proinflammatory gene expression pathway with up regulation of several cytokines , kinases and transcription factors ( Eckmann et al. , 2000 ; Zeng et al. , 2003 ) .

Resistance to systemic salmonellosis in the chicken is a polygenic phenomenon as demonstrated in a number of studies ( Lamont , 1998 ; Kramer et al. , 2003a ; Malek and Lamont , 2003 ; Malek et al. , 2004 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) .

Susceptibility to Salmonella caecal carrier state was investigated in chickens 1 to 6 wk of age . 
A downregulation of IFN-g was found in the caecal tonsils of susceptible chickens compared to the resistant animals understanding of host -- pathogen interactions .

Salmonella on host gene expression using GeneChips is so far not studied in chickens . 
In this study , the response on a 
Salmonella infection in relation to the genetic background of the host is studied . 
In the present study , we describe the gene expression response in the intestine of young chickens after a Salmonella infection . 
The gene expression differences found with the GeneChips were conﬁrmed using quantitative reverse transcription RT-PCR . 
Two different chicken groups were also used and the results were compared with each other to determine the role of the genetic background in the host response . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
had 43,604 points in which every 3 points represent 3 repeats of one gene . 
Negative controls and housekeeping genes were removed , it had 13,319 probe sequences of chicken . 
Experimental animals
The following study was approved by the Institute of poultry , China Academy of Agricultural Sciences in accordance with the Dutch regulations on animal experimentation , eight full sib family of Rugao chickens ( China native breeds , Jiangsu province ) were used in the present study . 
The chickens were free of Salmonella by detecting faecal samples . 
Four were for group A , whereas the other four were for Group B. 
Experimental infection
Eight 14-d old chickens of each group ( A and B ) were randomly divided into 2 groups . 
The birds were determined to be free of Salmonella when hatching . 
Of the chicken , 
Studies in chickens have also revealed considerable four chickens of 14-day old were orally inoculated with 0.2 differences between lines in levels of colonization of ml of a bacterial suspension containing 105 CFU S. serovar
Enteritidis phage type 4 ( nalidixic acid resistant ) . 
Four chickens of the control group were inoculated with 0.2 ml saline . 
The four chickens of each group were sacrificed 24 h post infection . 
For detection of S. serovar Enteritidis a cloacal swab was taken and after overnight enrichment it was spread on brilliant green agar +100 ppm nalidixic acid nitrogen , 50 to 100 mg tissues of the different chicks were used to isolate total RNA using TRIzol reagent ( Agilent ) , according to instructions of the manufacturer with an additional step . 
The homogenized tissue samples were resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent using a syringe and 
21 gauge needle and passing the lysate through 10 times . 
After homogenisation , insoluble material was removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 C. Total RNA of intestine was isolated by 
Ribonucleic Acid Analysis , 2100 ( Agilent ) and was then purified by QIAGEN RNeasy Kit , according to the introductions of Qiagen . 
Preparation of DNA probe and fluorescein mark
cRNA samples were purified and marked with kit constructed by QIAGEN , which were synthesized from mRNA by two reverse transcriptions . 
The concentration and the purity of each sample was analyzed at OD260 nm and 
OD280 nm with ultraviolet spectrophotometer by Cy3-marker , the content of cRNA was adjusted , the molecular concentration of fluorescence was analyzed , the content o

Four genes were selected from all differently expressed 
hybridizated at 65 C , at 10 rpm , for 17 h. 
Washing , scanning , GeneChip data normalization and 
analysis 
The chip was dislodged into lotion 1 for washing for 1 min , and then put into lotion 2 for washing for 1 min ( 37 C ) . 
Then the chip was scanned in an Agilent scanner with a resolution of 5 m , and the scanner automatically scanned the chip to 100 % and 10 % PMT for each , respectively . 
The 8 GeneChips , four sets from each group were scanned and data was quantiﬁed using the Agilent scanner and Genespring software . 
Spot intensities were calculated , using the median value of all spots for further analysis . 
Poor-quality spots ( ﬂag = 0 ) were ﬁltered from the raw data of each array before analysis , followed by background subtraction of median intensity signals ( F532 median-B532 median ) and then rescaled by global normalization ( Quantile ) and different functional classifications were divided by Gene Ontology ( GO ) . 
Net intensities less than 500 from the normalized data were removed and the remaining signals are transformed logarithmically . 
Statistically signiﬁcant differential gene expression was characterized from four sets of GeneChip data derived from each group , using the unpaired t-test . 
Because the ratio on the array is expressed in a log2 scale , a ratio of > 2.00 or < 0.50 corresponds to a more than twofold up - or downregulation respectively . 
To compare with the quantitative PCR , the log2 ratios were transformed to normal ratios . 
In order to select signiﬁcant gene expression changes , genes showing statistically different ( p < 0.01 ) expression levels , representing two-fold or greater were selected and processed for further analysis by quantitative RT-PCR to fragment containing sequences from two adjacent exons in was used as an internal reference gene . 
The primer pairs were used to analyze gene expression and the size of genes for further investigation of their expression . 
Realtime quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate these .

All the real-time RT-PCR fold differences were in complete correspondence with the microarray data . 
This positive correlation suggests that our microarray data is an accurate reﬂection of levels of gene expression present in the intestine tissue taken from the two chicken groups ( Table 4 ) . 
DISCUSSION
So far few articles are published studying gene expression profiles in the chicken and each study used a different array platform . 
This makes it difficult to interpret and compare results from different experiments . 
Recently the first draft genome sequence of the red jungle fowl , G. gallus has become available ( International Chicken Genome the different cell types and multiple functions . 
To highlight the responses after a Salmonella infection in cellular context the gene expression in the whole intestine of 14-d old chickens was investigated with GeneChips as is reviewed 
( Amundson et al. , 2001 ) . 
This array contains a comprehensive coverage of 13,319 probes used to construct gene expression profiles in order to screen differentially important to identify complex cellular regulation . 
As expected , genes that were identified to be up-regulated in response to the Salmonella infection in the intestine were involved in different stages of the immune responses in both chicken groups , such as TLR5 , THBS1 , KIT , and FGF10 . 
Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) senses flagellin of several bacterial species and activates the innate immune system . 
The avian TLR repertoire exhibits considerable functional diversity compared to mammalian TLRs and evidence of a functional TLR5 in the avian species is lacking . 
Keestra et al. ( 2008 ) found that chicken TLR5 activation by flagellin of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium revealed that chTLR5 consistently yielded stronger responses than human but not mouse TLR5 . 
This species-specific reactivity was not observed with flagellin of serovar Enteritidis . 
These results show that chickens express a functional TLR5 albeit with different flagellin sensing qualities compared to human TLR5 . 
Tucker et al. . 
lower than that in group B from the Figure . 
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of differentially expressed 
( 1997 ) found that TSP-1 is expressed in the spinal cord floor plate , in mesenchyme surrounding the developing paramesonephric duct , at the tips of growing lung bronchioles , in lens and in corneal endothelium . 
These observations indicate that there is little overlap in the expression patterns of TSP-1 and that it is expressed consecutively during the development of cartilage and neurons . 
The pattern of TSP-1 expression in vascular tissues and in the floor plate is consistent with possible roles for this glycoprotein in regulating angiogenesis and establishing morphogenetic gradients . 
Chicken Kit was isolated from a chicken brain cDNA library . 
The deduced amino acid ( aa ) sequence of chicken Kit shows 63 % identity to mouse Kit , and suggests that chicken Kit shares common structural and functional features with mouse Kit . 
RNA blot analysis indicated that the expression pattern of the chicken c-kit transcript in chicken organs was similar to that of mouse c-kit in mice , suggesting that chicken Kit has biological roles analogous to those of mouse Kit ( Sasaki et al. , 1997 ) . 
In a previous study of Shin et al. ( 2006 ) , they showed that FGF10 was an early mesenchymal signal that was critically associated with the developmental processes in the proventricular epithelium . 
Furthermore , virusmediated Fgf10 over expression results in a hypermorphic epithelial structure and an increase in epithelial cell number . 
In fibroblasts , wild-type v-Rel induced expression of mip ¬ 
1beta and nfkb1 , while non transforming mutants of v-Rel failed to do so , suggesting a role for these two genes in v-Rel mediated transformation . 
Finally , these genes are expressed at high levels in cells over expressing wild-type and truncated forms of c-Rel , implying that v-Rel transforms , in part , by induction of c-Rel target genes

Excluding the genes involved in the immune system process , using microarray hybridization methods we alsoisolated a number of other differentially expressed genes . 
Most of the other genes we identiﬁed were related to transporter activity , metabolic process , cellular process , biological regulation and growth ( Tables 2 and 3 ) , as deﬁned by the Gene Ontology ( Al-Shahrour et al. , 2004 ) . 
The 588 genes screened by the Agilent microarray were divided into different categories according to their functions , for example , 24 genes associated with immune system process , 201 with metabolic process and 300 with cellular process . 
Information could be subtle as to the function of each gene and its participation in the relevant biological path . 
However , GO functional classification reduced the tedious validation of gene function by biological methods and could divide known genes into different functional classifications . 
GO could also speculate that the ` unknown ' genes , some of which sequences had no annotation in

This suggested that the TLR5 gene in the immune system process showed an ascent trend , indicating that the immune response activity was relatively strengthening in Rugao chicken intestine to a Salmonella infection over time .
