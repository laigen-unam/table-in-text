Resistance to pathogens such as Salmonella enteritidis ( SE ) is a heritable trait important in maintaining the health of chickens and reducing bacterial contamination of poultry products . 
In chickens , heterophils act as the ﬁrst responders to bacterial infections and are , therefore , responsible for initiating the immune response against SE challenge . 
This study measured mRNA expression of several immune response genes [ interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-10 , transforming growth factor-b4 ( TGF-b4 ) , granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and Toll-like receptor-4 ( TLR-4 ) ] by heterophils from broiler , Leghorn , and Fayoumi chickens , either non-stimulated or stimulated in vitro with SE using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR . 
We found that heterophils of commercially selected broiler and Leghorn birds had differing early heterophil responses to SE in comparison with the native Fayoumi line . 
Heterophil stimulation with SE in vitro increased expression of pro- ( IL-6 and GM-CSF ) and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine mRNA ( IL-10 and TGF-b4 ) in the Fayoumi line , while the broiler and Leghorn line heterophils had decreased or no changes in the cytokine gene expression levels . 
The unique response of the Fayoumi line is in contrast to the lines with a history of genetic selection to increase growth or reproduction , a process which may favor reduced or suppressed inﬂammatory responses . 
The ﬁndings illustrate the potential value of native lines to provide biodiversity to enhance innate health in commercially selected poultry .

1. Introduction
Bacteria such as Salmonella enteritidis ( SE ) are a serious threat to the poultry industry , causing losses through reduced production and mortality , as well as illness in consumers of undercooked contaminated meat and eggs ( Patrick et al. , 2004 ; Schroeder et al. , 2005 ) . 
Adult hens infected with SE may show no visible signs of disease and

doi :10.1016 / j.vetimm .2009.05.010 be maintained in the production ﬂock ( Sadeyen et al. , 2004 ) . 
They shed the pathogen intermittently in both eggs and feces ( Shivaprased et al. , 1990 ; Van Immerseel et al. , 2004 ) , which makes testing individuals for presence of the bacterium unreliable . 
These limitations , combined with increasing restriction on antimicrobial use in production animals , have intensiﬁed the need to ﬁnd new ways to increase resistance to SE and other bacterial pathogens . 
The chicken immune response to SE is under genetic control , with a wide range of variation in the observed responses ( Guillot et al. , 1995 ; Kramer et al. , 2001 ; Cheeseman et al. , 2006 ) . 
Dissecting the immune respons into the dominant cell types responsible has shown that variation in resistance to SE can also be observed at the cellular level ( Qureshi et al. , 1986 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2003 ) and can be attributed to differences at the gene regulatory level ( Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ; Wigley et al. , 2006 ) . 
Investigating the gene expression response to SE by immune cells from diverse genetic lines will provide an understanding of the genetic variation available within the species , and insight into how the response can be enhanced . 
The immune system must compete with other body systems for resources . 
Selection to increase speciﬁc parameters of immune response has been shown to have negative effects on production traits in chickens ( Pinardvan der Laan et al. , 1998b ; Lamont et al. , 2003 ; Cheng and Lamont , 2008 ) ; therefore , thorough dissection of the genetic regulation of immune function is necessary . 
The Fayoumi line used in this study has previously been shown to have unique alleles not found in the broiler or Leghorn lines ( Zhou and Lamont , 1999 ; Liu et al. , 2003 ) , which may contribute to its relative resistance against pathogens ( Pinard-van der Laan et al. , 1998a ) . 
By comparing lines that have been selected for commercial meat or egg production with a line that has not undergone commercial selection , we can also better understand the genetic relationship between production traits and immune function . 
In chickens , heterophils are key components of the innate immune system and serve in the same role as neutrophils in mammals ( Harmon , 1998 ) . 
While manyassumptions arestill made about the similarity of heterophils and neutrophils , there is a growing body of knowledge speciﬁc to chicken heterophils . 
Heterophils are the initial responders to numerous pathogens and irritants ( Latimer et al. , 1988 , 1990 ; Chansoriya et al. , 1993 ; Fulton et al. , 1993 ; Kogut et al. , 1998 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2005 ) , and are important in pathogen detection and the initiation of cytokine and chemokine production to signal other immune cells ( Latimer et al. , 1988 , 1990 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 , 2006 ) . 
Pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) on the surface of heterophils recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) of foreign microorganisms , stimulating phagocytosis and destruction of bacteria , which are also essential parts of the heterophil 's function repertoire ( Powell , 1987 ; Andreasen et al. , 1991 ; Stabler et al. , 1994 ) . 
Although polymorphonuclear leukocytes , including heterophils , were long thought to be transcriptionally inactive , studies of gene expression have clearly shown that they produce cytokines in response to bacterial stimulation of PRRs ( Kogut et al. , 2003 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 , 2006 ) . 
The regulation of innate immune cells is important for directing the adaptive immune response ( Fearon and Locksley , 1996 ) and is therefore useful in genetic selection for improved response to pathogens ( Lamont , 1998 ) . 
Many cytokines initially identiﬁed in mammalian systems have also been cloned and characterized in chickens ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ; Kogut et al. , 2003 ; Avery et al. , 2004 ; Rothwell et al. , 2004 ) . 
Expression levels of mRNA of two pro-inﬂammatory cytokines ( Interleukin-6 , IL-6 ; granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor , GM-CSF ) , two anti-inﬂammatory cytokines ( IL-10 ; transforming growth factor-b4 , TGF-b4 ) and the cell-surface receptor that binds lipopolysaccharide ( Toll-like receptor-4 , TLR-4 ) in SE-stimulated heterophils were selected as endpoints in this study . 
IL-6 enhances degranulation of mammalian neutrophils ( Borish et al. , 1989 ) , which is an important mechanism for bacterial killing , however this effect has not been detected in heterophils ( Ferro et al. , 2004 ) . 
GM-CSF is necessary for proper neutrophil function in humans ( Uchida et al. , 2007 ) and enhances phagocytosis of bacteria through priming ( Fleischmann et al. , 1986 ) . 
IL-10 negatively regulates pro-inﬂammatory responses at multiple levels ( Mocellin et al. , 2003 ) . 
Chicken TGF-b4 is analogous to TGF-b1 in humans ( Jakolew et al. , 1997 ) , and is classiﬁed as an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine while mediating the immune response at multiple levels ( Withanage et al. , 2005 ) . 
Infection with bacterial patho-gens causes changes in the expression of TGF-b4 by chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Cheeseman et al. , 2006 ) , intestine and spleen ( Jakolew et al. , 1997 ) , and heterophils ( Kogut et al. , 2003 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) . 
TLR-4 is important in the immune response to SE because of its roles in detecting the presence of the pathogen ( Akashi et al. , 2001 ) , stimulative effect on bacterial killing mechanisms , and production of pro-inﬂammatory cyto-kines ( Kogut et al. , 2005 ) . 
PRRs such as TLR-4 are differentially regulated during infection ( Abasht et al. , 2008 ) , which could modulate the production of downstream products , such as IL-6 . 
Evaluating the expression of these genes by heterophils from genetically diverse lines in response to SE will increase the understanding of the role of the heterophil in this response and how it may be improved through genetic selection .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Birds and housing
The birds were from broiler , Leghorn ( Ghs-6 ) and Fayoumi ( M15 .2 ) lines maintained at the Iowa State University Poultry Farm . 
The broiler line is characteristic of outbred birds used for meat production ( Kaiser et al. , 1998 ) . 
Leghorn chickens are commonly used in egg production , and have contributed greatly to many commercial egg-laying lines . 
The Fayoumi chicken is native to Egypt , and has not undergone selection for improved meat or egg production . 
The Leghorn and Fayoumi lines used are highly inbred ( Zhou and Lamont , 1999 ) . 
Chicks were randomly selected from two hatches , tagged at hatch to identify pedigree , and received no vaccinations . 
Birds were housed in a controlled environment room in ﬂoor pens and had ad libitum access to commercial starter diet and water . 
2.2. Blood collection
Blood samples were taken from 162 birds ( 54 per line ) at eight weeks of age . 
Whole blood was collected from the jugular vein into syringes with 1:10 ( v/v ) 10 % EDTA . 
Blood samples were combined within line in random pools of three , to ensure isolation of an adequate quantity of heterophils for assays . 
This generated a total of 54 samples ( 18 per line ) for analysis 
Heterophil isolation was done as previously described ( Chuammitri et al. , 2009 ) . 
Each blood pool was mixed 1:1 with 1 % methylcellulose ( Sigma -- Aldrich , USA ) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15 g . 
The buffy coat and plasma were transferred to another tube . 
The erythrocyte pellet was rinsed with Hank 's Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS , 1X , Cellgro , USA ) with 0.1 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Atlanta Biologicals , USA ) which was added to the buffy coat and plasma portion , followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 370 g. Supernatant was discarded and HBSS with FBS used to resuspend the pellets . 
These suspensions were layered onto discontinuous density gradients ( speciﬁc gravity 1.077 over 1.119 g/ml ; Sigma -- Aldrich , USA ) and centrifuged for 30 min at 500 g . 
The 1.077 / 1.119 interfaces and 1.119 bands were collected , washed with HBSS with FBS , and centrifuged for 10 min at 370 g. Heterophil pellets were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer and treated for 3 min . 
A ﬁnal wash was performed with HBSS followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 370 g and resuspension of the pellets in HBSS . 
Each suspension was divided equally into two aliquots , each of which was diluted to a ﬁnal heterophil concentration of 5 106 cells/ml with HBSS only ( unstimulated aliquot ) or with live Salmonella enteritidis in HBSS at twice the heterophil concentration ( stimulated aliquot ) for a ﬁnal bacterial concentration of 1 107 cfu/ml . 
Preliminary studies showed these concentrations of heterophils and bacteria maximized heterophil performance in bacterial killing and oxidative burst assays ( data not shown ) . 
Both aliquots were then incubated for 2 h at 41 8C with 5 % CO2 . 
Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 370 g , the liquid was discarded , and the cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of RNAlater ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) . 
2.4. Total RNA isolation
Heterophils in RNAlater were centrifuged for 8 min at 370 g and the liquid portion discarded . 
Heterophil pellets were resuspended in 300 ml of Lysis/Binding Solution ( RNAqueous Kit , Ambion ) and vortexed for 1 min . 
The manufacturer 's recommended isolation procedure was followed . 
Total RNA samples were treated with DNA-free ( Ambion ) and diluted to 50 ng/ml . 
2.5. Gene expression assays
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR ( QPCR ) was performed to measure mRNA expression levels of IL-10 , IL-6 , TGF-b4 , GM-CSF , and TLR-4 using the QuantiTect SYBR-Green system ( Qiagen , Waltham , MA ) on an Opticon 2 ( MJ Research , Waltham , MA ) . 
All reactions were performed in triplicate , with 12.5 ml QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix , 0.25 ml QuantiTect RT mix , forward and reverse primers , 50 or 75 ng of total RNA , and RNase-free water to bring reaction volume to 25 ml . 
All primer sequences have been previously reported ( IL-10 , AJ621614 , Rothwell et al. , 2004 ; IL-6 , AJ250838 , Kaiser et al. , 2000 ; TGF-b4 , M31160 , Kogut et al. , 2003 ; TLR-4 , 
AY064697 , Abasht et al. , 2008 ; GM-CSF , AJ621740 , Avery et al. , 2004 ) . 
The QPCR program consisted of 50 8C for 30 min , 95 8C for 15 min , and 40 cycles of 94 8C for 15 s , 59 8C for 30 s , 72 8C for 30 s , and a plate read . 
A melting curve from 60 to 90 8C with readings every 1 8C was generated for each plate . 
A serial dilution of plasmid was used to determine gene slope for each plate . 
To account for plate variation and reaction efﬁciency , adjusted cycle threshold ( C ( t ) ) values were calculated by : 40 [ C ( t ) sample mean + ( C ( t ) 28s median C ( t ) 28s mean ) ] ( gene slope/28s slope ) . 
Mean adjusted C ( t ) values of each triplicate of assays were used in statistical analysis . 
Fold change was calculated by : 2 ( mean adjusted C ( t ) for SE-stimulated heterophils mean adjusted C ( t ) for unstimulated heterophils ) .

2.6. Statistical analysis
Each gene 's mRNA expression levels were analyzed with the JMP software ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) ANOVA model . 
The main ﬁxed effects were line and heterophil stimulation with SE , and the interaction of these effects . 
Hatch was included as random . 
Signiﬁcant differences in classes due to these main effects were ranked using Student 's t-test . 
3. Results
The signiﬁcant effects of genetic line , bacterial stimulation and their interaction on heterophil expression of the tested genes are presented in Table 1 . 
Bacterial stimulation signiﬁcantly affected IL-10 expression ( P = 0.004 ) . 
The interaction of genetic line and SE exposure was signiﬁcant for IL-6 ( P = 0.008 ) , TGF-b4 ( P < 0.001 ) , TLR-4 ( P = 0.029 ) , and GM-CSF ( P = 0.004 ) . 
Genetic line was also signiﬁcant for IL-6 ( P = 0.048 ) and GM-CSF ( P < 0.001 ) , and for both genes this was a result of the differences in the stimulated heterophils . 
TLR-4 showed low levels of detectable expression in all assays . 
Hatch group was included as a random effect in the model for all genes , but had a signiﬁcant effect only on IL-10 expression ( P = 0.013 ) . 
The mRNA expression levels of unstimulated hetero-phils were similar regardless of genetic background for all tested genes . 
Genetic line differences occurred in the stimulated cells only ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Fold-change difference in expression due to stimulation with SE was greatest in IL-6 and GM-CSF , for which the Fayoumi line increased expression by 7.0 - and 16.7-fold , respectively ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Neither the broiler nor Leghorn lines showed similarly strong heterophil responses to SE

4. Discussion
All tested genes showed similar levels of unstimulated expression across genetic lines . 
This is contrast with the ﬁndings of Swaggerty et al. ( 2004 ) , who observed differences in basal expression of IL-6 and IL-8 by heterophils isolated from two commercial broiler lines at 1 day of age . 
Differences between studies may be attributed to differences in the age of the birds , because the granulocytic population undergoes changes during the period from day of hatch to eight weeks of age ( Oláh and 
Glick , 1983 ; Kogut et al. , 2002 ) . 
Heterophil expression of IL-6 and other cytokines has been shown to change in the period from 1 to 28 days following hatch ( Swaggerty et al. , 2006 ) . 
Stimulation with SE resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in heterophil expression of IL-10 in the broiler and Leghorn lines . 
This result contrasts previous work , which has shown IL-10 expression to increase in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on the surface of pathogens such as SE ( Rothwell et al. , 2004 ) , as is IL-6 ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003 ; Chiang et al. , 2008 ) . 
In the current study , the change in expression of IL-6 mirrored those seen in IL-10 , with both the broiler and Leghorn lines decreasing expression if exposed to SE . 
This may indicate a divergence in the systemic anti-bacterial immune response of the broiler and Leghorn lines , as compared to the Fayoumi line . 
The response of IL-6 , TGF-b4 , TLR-4 , and GM-CSF expression upon SE stimulation was different among the genetic lines tested . 
With the exception of TLR-4 , which was consistently low , the response of the Fayoumi line diverged from the broiler and Leghorn lines . 
The increased expression of IL-6 and GM-CSF observed in the Fayoumi line reﬂect the expected pro-inﬂammatory response to SE , while the broiler and Leghorn lines did not signiﬁcantly alter levels of expression of these genes . 
Comparison of a broiler line more resistant to SE with a broiler line more susceptible to SE showed that heterophils of the resistant line had higher expression of IL-6 ( Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ; Chiang et al. , 2008 ) . 
Expression levels of TGF-b4 , an antiinﬂammatory cytokine which has increased expression by heterophils during receptor-mediated phagocytosis , were also higher in the resistant than the susceptible line ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003 ) . 
In the current experiment , the Fayoumi line showed higher expression of IL-6 and TGF-b4 , associated with increased resistance to SE , in comparison with the broiler and Leghorn lines . 
Of the three lines tested , the Fayoumi line heterophils showed the strongest response to SE stimulation in all cytokines . 
This breed originated in Egypt as a free range bird and has not undergone commercial selection for meat or egg production , as did the broiler and Leghorn lines , which may have contributed to the Fayoumi 's disease resistance ( Pinard-van der Laan et al. , 1998a ) . 
Selection for rapid growth or reproduction has been negatively correlated with immune response in several species ( Shook , 1989 ; Nestor et al. , 1996 ; Bayyari et al. , 1997 ; Henryon et al. , 2002 ) . 
Mounting an inﬂammatory response reallocates energy and nutrients away from other processes , reducing the resources available for growth and reproduction ( Klasing , 1998 ) . 
Selection in commercial lines is reported to result in the loss of many rare alleles from the majority of these lines ( Muir et al. , 2008 ) , which these authors suggest may reduce the ability of commercial lines to effectively meet disease challenges . 
The current study shows the Fayoumi line to be distinctly more responsive to Salmonella , as assessed by cytokine expression , than chicken lines with a history of commercial selection . 
By assessing the responses of genetically different lines , future decisions can be better made to enhance innate disease resistance by genetic selection .
