role of AcrAB-mediated efflux

Summary 
Adaptation to bile is the ability to endure the lethal effects of bile salts after growth on sublethal concentrations . 
Surveys of adaptation to bile in Salmonella enterica ser . 
Tyhimurium reveal that active efflux is essential for adaptation while other bacterial functions involved in bile resistance are not . 
Among S. enterica mutants lacking one or more efflux systems , only strains lacking AcrAB are unable to adapt , thus revealing an essential role for AcrAB . 
Transcription of the acrAB operon is upregulated in the presence of a sublethal concentration of sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) while other efflux loci are either weakly upre-gulated or irresponsive . 
Upregulation of acrAB transcription is strong during exponential growth , and weak in stationary cultures . 
Single cell analysis of ethidium bromide accumulation indicates that DOC-induced AcrAB-mediated efflux occurs in both exponential and stationary cultures . 
Upregulation of acrAB expression may thus be crucial at early stages of adaptation , while sustained AcrAB activity may be sufficient to confer bile resistance in nondividing cells . 
Introduction
Bile is a fluid synthesized by parenchymal cells in the liver . 
Bile aids in the digestion of fats , facilitates absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine , and contributes to the elimination of excess cholesterol and waste products of hepatic metabolism ( Hofmann , 1998 ) . 
About two-thirds of bile ( dry weight ) are made of bile salts , a family of mole-cules with steroid structure which derive from cholesterol ( Hofmann and Hagey , 2008 ) . 
Aside from their role in digestion , bile salts are physiological signals for transcriptional

regulation of both mammalian and bacterial genes ( Forman et al. , 1995 ; Gupta and Chowdhury , 1997 ; Makishima et al. , 1999 ; Schuhmacher and Klose , 1999 ; Van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ; Makishima et al. , 2002 ; Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Malik-Kale et al. , 2008 ; D'Aldebert et al. , 2009 ; Eade et al. , 2016 ) . 
In a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde dichotomy , however , bile salts are also antibacterial compounds that disrupt membranes , denature proteins and cause oxidative DNA damage . 
At high concentrations , bile salts are bactericidal ( Coleman et al. , 1980 ; Kandell and Bernstein , 1991 ; Gomez Zavaglia et al. , 2002 ; Leverrier et al. , 2003 ; Prieto et al. , 2004 ; 2006 ; Merritt and Donaldson , 2009 ) . 
Bacterial species that colonize the mammalian intestine are resistant to bile salts , and a relevant example is Salmo-nella enterica , whose ability to endure bile permits not only intestinal survival but also colonization of the hepatobiliary tract including the gall bladder ( Sinnott and Teall , 1987 ; Andrews-Polymenis et al. , 2010 ; Crawford et al. , 2010 ; Gonzalez-Escobedo and Gunn , 2013 ) . 
In fact , the gall bladder is the major niche for the human-adapted serovar Salmonella Typhi in chronic carriers of typhoid ( Gonzalez-Escobedo et al. , 2011 ) . 
Salmonella survival in the mamma-lian gall bladder appears to involve several strategies . 
One is invasion of the gall bladder epithelium ( Menendez et al. , 
2009 ; Gonzalez-Escobedo et al. , 2013 ) , which may permit escape from the high concentrations of bile salts present in the gall bladder lumen . 
Formation of biofilms on gallstones may also protect Salmonella from bile salts ( Prouty et al. , 2002 ; Crawford et al. , 2008 ; 2010 ) . 
In addition , planktonic 
Salmonella cells are found in the gall bladder lumen , and the physiological responses that permit survival remain unknown . 
Bile resistance can be studied under laboratory conditions by supplementing microbiological culture media with either ox bile or individual bile salts ( Pace et al. , 1997 ; Van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ; Raphael et al. , 2005 ; Froelich et al. , 2006 ; Malik-Kale et al. , 2008 ; Casadesus et al. , 2010 ; Lertpiriyapong et al. , 2012 ) . 
Using this reductionist approach , genetic and biochemical analysis has permitted the identification of cell components and mechanisms involved in bacterial resistance to bile ( Gunn , 2000 ; Casadesus et al. , 2010 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ; 2013 ; 2015 ) . 
Examples include envelope structures like the lipopolysaccharide ( Picken and Beacham , 1977 ; Van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ; Murata et al. , 2007 ; Crawford et al. , 2012 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ; May and Groisman , 2013 ) and the enterobacterial common antigen ( Ramos-Morales et al. , 2003 ) , which serve as barriers that reduce intake of bile salts . 
Downregulation of genes encoding porins ( Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) may also reduce intake of bile salts . 
In turn , peptidoglycan remodelling may permit bile-insensitive cell wall synthesis ( Hernandez et al. , 2015 ) . 
However , envelope barriers are insufficient to prevent bile intake , and the activity of efflux pumps is necessary to prevent intracellular accumulation of bile salts ( Thanassi et al. , 1997 ; Piddock , 2006 ) .

Efflux systems are responsible for resistance to numerous compounds ( Gunn , 2000 ) . 
Nine efflux systems have been characterized in Salmonella enterica , belonging to four families : resistance nodulation division ( RND ) ; major facilitator superfamily ( MF ) ; multidrug and toxic-compound extrusion ( MATE ) and ATP-binding cassette superfamily ( ABC ) . 
AcrAB-TolC , an RND efflux transporter , is the best characterized efflux system in enteric bacteria ( Ma et al. , 
functions may have complementary roles . 
1993 ; 1995 ; Zgurskaya and Nikaido , 1999 ; Nikaido et al. , 2008 ) . 
RND efflux transporters ( in this case , AcrB ) are embedded in the inner membrane , and form a complex with two other proteins , a periplasmic adaptor protein ( AcrA ) and an outer membrane channel ( TolC ) ( Dinh et al. , 
1994 ; Paulsen et al. , 1997 ; Pos , 2009 ) . 
RND efflux systems transport a wide range of substances outside the cell , including bile salts ( Nikaido , 1996 ; 2001 ; Murakami et al. , 2002 ) . 
The concentrations of bile or individual bile salts that inhibit Salmonella growth are not absolute , and the bile resistance level of wild type Salmonella can be increased over the customary minimal inhibitory concentration by growth in the presence of sublethal concentrations of either bile or individual bile salts ( Gunn , 2000 ; Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Prieto et al. , 2009 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) . 
This phenomenon , known as adaptation , is accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression ( Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) . 
Physiological adjustments that permit adaptation to bile include upregulation of stress responses and DNA repair mechanisms ( Prieto et al. , 
Fig . 
S1 ) . 
This criterion excluded the possibility that bile-resistant mutants had been selected . 
The mutants used in these trials carried loss-of-function mutations in pleiotropic regulatory loci ( dam , phoP , rpoS ) , in genes encoding components of the bacterial envelope ( wec , zapB ) , and in 
2006 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) , remodelling of the cell envelope ( Hernandez et al. , 2015 ) and activation of efflux systems ( Gunn , 2000 ; Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Nishino et al. , 2006 ; Nikaido et al. , 2008 ; Baucheron et al. , 2014 ) . 
Many other gene expression changes occur ( Hernandez et al. , 
2012), and remain to be interpreted.
This study addresses the question of whether adaptation of Salmonella to bile involves multiple physiological adjustments or can be ascribed to a discrete set of bile resistance functions . 
The issue has been investigated by genetic analysis , using assays that distinguish sensitivity to bile from adaptation to bile . 
To make interpretation possible , the mutants chosen for the study lacked cell functions whose role in bile resistance is more or less understood : the enterobacterial common antigen ( wec ) ( Ramos-Morales et al. , 2003 ) , DNA methylation ( dam ) ( Pucciarelli et al. , 2002 ; Prieto et al. , 2004 ) , virulence regulation ( phoP ) ( Van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ) , cell division factors ( damX and zapB ) ( Lopez-Garrido et al. , 2010 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) , the general stress response ( rpoS ) ( Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) and active efflux ( acrA , acrB and tolC ) ( Thanassi et al. , 1997 ; Prouty et al. , 
2004a ; Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Only a subset of the bile resistance functions included in the study appear to be required for adaptation : Dam methylation , the PhoPQ signal transduction system and active efflux . 
Among them , efflux mediated by the AcrAB pump stands out as essential . 
The need of AcrAB for adaptation is supported by gene expression assays and flow cytometry analyses that reveal a correlation between the presence of DOC and AcrABmediated efflux . 
We thus propose that AcrAB-mediated efflux is essential for adaptation to bile , while other

Surveys of bile adaptation in bile-sensitive mutants of S. enterica
The ability of S. enterica bile-sensitive mutants to adapt to bile was tested in two types of trials , outlined in Supporting Information Fig . 
S1 : ( i ) tests of the minimal concentration ( MIC ) of DOC after incubation in the presence of a suble-thal concentration of DOC ; ( ii ) plate assays of resistance to ox bile after incubation in the presence of a sublethal concentration of DOC . 
In the latter assay , we used LB agar containing gradients of ox bile , a classical technique in studies of antibiotic resistance ( Szybalski and Bryson , 1952 ) . 
Gradient plates permit visual assessment of adaptation in the presence of ox bile , and sort out the problem posed by the dark colour of bile , which makes MIC determination difficult and unreliable . 
In both kinds of assays , adaptation was confirmed when the increased resistance level was found to be reversible ( Supporting Information genes encoding efflux pump components ( acrA , acrB , tolC ) . 
The adaptation trials were performed in two steps : 
( i ) The maximal concentration of DOC that permitted survival was determined for each strain ( Table 1 ) . 
Sensitivity to DOC was found to be extreme in acrA , acrB and tolC . 
This conclusion is in agreement with previous studies showing that AcrAB-mediated efflux is essential for bile resistance in Escherichia coli and Salmonella ( Thanassi et al. , 1997 ; Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
( ii ) Aliquots from exponential cultures grown in LB containing a sublethal concentration of DOC were either 
The main observations made in these trials were as follows : 
( i ) Exposure to a sublethal concentration of DOC increased the level of bile resistance of certain bile-indicating that full adaptation had occurred ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ) . 
( ii ) Other mutants ( dam and phoP ) increased their resistance to bile but did not reach the wild type level , suggesting that DNA methylation and the PhoPQ regulon are involved in adaptation ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ) . 
( iii ) The acrA , acrB and tolC mutants were unable to adapt to bile ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ) .

Surveys of adaptation to bile in S. enterica mutants lacking efflux systems
The observation that only mutants lacking efflux pump components ( acrA , acrB and tolC ) were unable to adapt to bile led us to investigate whether the additional efflux systems described in S. enterica had also a role in adaptation . 
used to monitor the MIC of DOC in microtiter plates or spread on LB agar containing a gradient of ox bile ( 0 % -- 30 % ) . 
Bacterial growth was monitored after overnight incubation at 378C . 
As controls , aliquots from exponential cultures in LB ( in other words , not 
For this purpose , single efflux pump mutants were constructed and the minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) of sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) were determined for each strain . 
Lack of efflux pumps other than AcrAB did not severely impair bile resistance ( Table 3 ) , as described previously in strain ATCC 14028 ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Furthermore , mutants lacking individual efflux pumps other than AcrAB were able to adapt after overnight growth in LB 1 5 % DOC ( Table 4 and Fig. 2 ) . 
Even though single mutants lacking efflux pumps other than AcrAB were still able to adapt , we considered the possibility that these pumps might play an ancillary role in bile resistance . 
To investigate this possibility , mutants that lacked from two to eight efflux systems were constructed by sequential disruption of each efflux pump gene ( leaving the acrAB genes intact ) . 
When these strains were used to determine MICs of DOC and to monitor growth on ox bile gradient plates , their resistance levels were found to be as previously described in strain ATCC 14028 ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
Adaptation trials were then carried out , using the customary 5 % DOC as the adaptive concentration . 
All mutants , including the strain lacking 8 efflux systems ( all but AcrAB ) , were able to adapt ( Fig. 3 ) . 
A noteworthy indicating that the AcrAD pump is dispensable . 
Altogether , these observations support the conclusion that adaptation to bile specifically requires AcrAB-mediated efflux , and that the additional efflux systems of S. enterica ser . 
Typhimurium are dispensable .

Bacterial growth was monitored after overnight incubation at 378C . 
As controls , aliquots from exponential cultures in LB ( in other words , not 
pre-exposed to DOC ) were also subjected to MIC determination and plated on bile gradient agar . 
An additional control was SV6544 , a strain carrying a mutant allele of yrbK that confers hyper-resistance to bile ( Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) . 
To test whether 
adaptation had occurred or not , the cultures were diluted and grown overnight in LB broth . 
The following day , aliquots were either used for MIC determination or plated on ox bile gradient agar . 
A decrease in the level of resistance to bile confirmed 
the occurrence of adaptation , and ruled out the selection of bile-resistant mutants .

Activation of acrAB expression by sodium deoxycholate 
The relevance of AcrAB-mediated efflux in adaptation to bile led us to study the expression pattern of the acrA and acrB genes during the adaptation process . 
For this purpose , the levels of acrA and acrB mRNAs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) in cultures grown with 5 % DOC . 
The strains under study were the wild type and SV7636 ( acrD mdtK mdfA emrA acrF mdtA macA mdsA ) . 
In the wild type , the expression levels of efflux pump genes other than acrAB were also determined . 
Results shown in Fig. 4 can be summarized as

The 
strains analyzed were the wild type and SV7636 ( acrD mdtK mdfA emrA acrF mdtA macA mdsA ) , grown in LB and under bile adaptation conditions ( LB 1 5 % DOC ) . 
Relevant observations were as follows : 
sodium deoxycholate , as well as macA , mdsA , mdfA and mdtK , whose products are not known to be involved in bile transport ( Nishino et al. , 2006 ; Horiyama et al. , 2010 ) . 
Expression of these efflux

( ii ) Four hours after the addition of sodium deoxycholate to the cultures , the ethidium bromide fluorescence within the cells started to increase both in the wild 
type and in SV7636 , the strain devoid of efflux pumps other than AcrAB . 
However , the level of EtBr fluorescence was lower in adapted cultures ( LB 1 5 % DOC ) than in non-adapted cultures ( LB ) , indicating that efflux remained active ( Fig. 5A ) . 
Hence , DOC 
appears to keep efflux active independently of the growth phase but its intensity decreases as cells enter the stationary phase . 
A different representation of the same flow cytometry data ( Fig. 5B ) shows more clearly the occurrence of sustained efflux in the 
presence of DOC in stationary cultures . 
Discussion
This study distinguishes Salmonella cell functions involved in resistance to bile from functions involved in adaptation to bile . 
The distinction is simple : bile-sensitive mutants that are able to increase their bile resistance level identify functions that are dispensable for adaptation , while mutants that increase bile resistance to levels below the wild type identify cell functions involved in adaptation . 
Adaptation to bile is not hampered in damX , wecD , rpoS and zapB mutants despite the fact that they are bilesensitive ( Table 1 ) . 
A tentative interpretation is that adaptation may be a multitask , and that the existence of redundant or alternative adaptation mechanisms may permit that certain functions compensate for the absence of others . 
Especially remarkable is the dispensability of the general stress response , given that the RpoS regulon is strongly upregulated by bile and rpoS mutants are bilesensitive ( Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) ( Tables 1 and 2 , Fig. 1 ) . 
Adaptation was found to be suboptimal in other bilesensitive mutants , thereby identifying bile-resistant functions that play a role in adaptation . 
Lack of Dam meth-ylation permitted adaptation to concentrations of bile lower than the wild type , a defect that may be tentatively attrib-uted to lack of DNA strand discrimination upon mismatch repair and/or to an altered pattern of gene expression ( Prieto et al. , 2004 ; Balbontın et al. , 2006 ) . 
Suboptimal adaptation was also observed in a phoP mutant , sugges-ting that functions under PhoPQ control ( Van Velkinburgh and Gunn , 1999 ; Murata et al. , 2007 ) are necessary for full adaptation . 
An interesting observation was that a dam mutant adapted better to bile than a phoP mutant despite the fact that its more sensitive to bile ( Tables 1 and 2 , Fig. 1 ) . 
This difference may illustrate the complexity of adaptation , in agreement with the occurrence of multiple gene expression changes in the presence of a sublethal concentration of DOC ( Prouty et al. , 2004a ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) . 
Unlike other gene losses , mutations in acrA , acrB and tolC did not permit adaptation ( Tables 1 and 2 , Fig. 1 ) . 
Hence , adaptation to bile may be a multitask but the need of AcrAB-mediated efflux appears to be absolute . 
The possibility that lack of adaptation might be caused by use of a low concentration of DOC seems unlikely as the concentration of DOC used for acrA , acrB and tolC mutants did permit adaptation of a dam mutant ( Table 2 , Fig. 1 ) .

The fact that the behav-iour of SV7636 ( which lacks all efflux systems except AcrAB ) was similar to that of the wild type suggests that efflux pumps other than AcrAB do not 
( Stone and Miller , 1995 ; Lacroix et al. , 1996 ; Nishino et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , sensitivity to bile is not only cause of attenuation as the AcrAB-TolC system plays multiple roles in bacterial physiology and virulence ( Piddock , 2006 ; Sun et al. , 2014 ; Buckner et al. , 2016 ; Wang-Kan et al. , 2017 ) . 
systems appear to be dispensable for adaptation ( Tables 3 and 4 , Figs. 2 and 3 ) . 
A tentative interpretation is that the contribution of these efflux systems , some of them known to transport bile salts , may be minor in the presence of a functional AcrAB efflux system . 
In support of this view , a mutant lacking all efflux pumps except AcrAB remained able to adapt ( Table 4 , Fig. 3 ) . 
Analysis of transcript abundance by quantitative realtime PCR revealed that sublethal concentrations of DOC upregulate expression of the acrAB operon ( Fig. 4 ) . 
In turn , higher acrAB expression can be correlated with the increased efflux activity detected by single cell analysis of

EtBr accumulation in the presence of DOC ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Hence , acrAB upregulation may be a key event for adaptation , and may occur immediately or shortly after the encounter with bile . 
However , a steady state may be reached when a sufficient amount of AcrAB is present in the cell envelope , thereby explaining that upregulation of acrAB expression is lower in stationary cultures . 
DOC-induced efflux decreases when the cultures approach the stationary phase and remains low thereafter ( Fig. 5 ) . 
One tentative explanation may be that physiological responses involved in adaptation are active in stationary cultures , thus reducing bile intake and bile-induced intracellular damage . 
This possibility is supported by two observations : ( i ) stationary cultures are more resistant to bile than exponentially growing cultures ( Pucciarelli et al. , 2002 ) ; ( ii ) stress responses induced by sublethal concentrations of bile are active in nondividing cells ( Prieto et al. , 2006 ; Merritt and Donaldson , 2009 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ) . 
Furthermore , bile influx may be lower in adapted cultures as a consequence of cellular envelope remodelling , active stress responses and DNA repair mechanisms ( Prieto et al. , 2006 ; Hernandez et al. , 2012 ; 2015 ) . 
These responses may reduce the need of AcrABmediated efflux . 
The list of bile adaptation functions identified in this study is unlikely to be complete . 
However , our observations support a tentative model in which AcrAB-mediated efflux is essential to adapt , while other functions may have complementary roles . 
If one considers the multiple types of damage caused by bile salts ( Coleman et al. , 1980 ; Kandell and Bernstein , 1991 ; Gomez Zavaglia et al. , 2002 ; Leverrier et al. , 2003 ; Prieto et al. , 2004 ; 2006 ; Merritt and Donaldson , 2009 ) , it is not surprising that lowering their concentration inside the cell by active efflux may be a sine 
qua non condition to survive . 
The fundamental role of AcrAB-mediated efflux in adaptation to bile is reminiscent of other adaptive strategies involving active efflux . 
The list of compounds extruded by bacterial efflux pumps includes antibiotics , antiseptics , heavy metals , solvents , detergents , animal hormones and host-defense molecules ( Piddock , 2006 ; Martınez et al. , 
2009 ; Blair et al. , 2014 ) . 
Furthermore , certain efflux pumps can export virulence factors ( Piddock , 2006 ) . 
The observation that lack of AcrB function impairs Salmonella enterica virulence in vivo and in cell cultures ( Wang-Kan et al. 2017 ) therefore suggests that AcrAB-mediated activity may be necessary inside the animal host not only for efflux of bile and other obnoxious compounds but also for the secretion of virulence effectors . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, media, culture conditions and chemicals
Strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( often 1 abbreviated as S. enterica ) derive from SV5015 , a His derivative of the mouse-virulent strain SL1344 ( Supporting Information Table S1 ) . 
Strains SV7249 and SV7254 were constructed by transducing alleles from ATCC14028 to SL1344 . 
Transduction was performed with phage P22 HT 105/1 int201 ( Schmieger , 1972 and G. Roberts , unpublished data ) . 
The P22 HT transduction protocol was described elsewhere ( Garzon et al. , 1995 ) . 
To obtain phage-free isolates , transductants were purified by streaking on green plates , prepared according to Chan et al. ( 1972 ) , except that methyl blue ( Sigma Aldrich ) was substituted for aniline blue . 
Phage sensitivity was tested by cross-streaking with the clear-plaque mutant P22 H5 . 
Lysogeny Broth ( LB ) was used as liquid medium . 
LB plates contained agar at 15 g L final concentra-21 tion . 
Cultures were grown at 378C with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath . 
Deoxycholic acid ( sodium salt ) and sodium choleate ( ox bile extract ) were both from Sigma Aldrich . 
Antibiotics were used at the final concentrations described previously ( Prieto et al. , 2004 ) . 
Ethidium bromide was purchased from Sigma Aldrich . 
Gene disruption
Targeted gene disruption was achieved using plasmids pKD3 , pKD4 and pKD13 ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . 
To construct multiple efflux pump mutants ( e.g. , SV7636 ) , antibiotic resistance cassettes introduced during strain construction were excised by recombination with plasmid pCP20 ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) followed by transductions with mutant lysates of P22 HT phage ( Schmieger , 1972 ) . 
The oligonucleo-tides used for disruption ( labelled ` FOR ' and ` REV ' ) are listed in Supporting Information Table S2 together with the oligonucleotides used for allele verification ( labelled ` E ' ) by the polymerase chain reaction . 
Adaptation assay on bile gradient plates
Stationary cultures in LB broth were diluted 25 times ( 100 ml of bacterial suspension in 2.5 ml LB ) and incubated at 378C with shaking until they reached a concentration of approximately 1.2 3 108 cells ml21 . 
From these cultures , 100 ml were plated on 0 % -- 30 % ox bile agar gradient plates , and another 100 ml were diluted in 2.5 ml of LB with a sublethal concentration of sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) and incubated o/n at 378C with shaking . 
The following day , the cultures were diluted like the day before in LB with DOC and incubated until there where roughly 1.2 3 108 cells ml21 ; 100 ml of the culture were plated on the ox bile gradient plates while other 100 ml were cultured o/n in LB . 
The overnight cultures where diluted in LB like the previous days , and plated again on ox bile gradient plates . 
All the plates were incubated at 378C for 2 days , growth was visually monitored . 
Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MIC ) of sodium deoxycholate 
Exponential cultures in LB broth were prepared , and samples 2 containing around 3 3 10 colony-forming-units ( CFU ) were transferred to polypropylene microtiter plates ( Soria Genlab ) containing known amounts of DOC . 
After 12 h incubation at 378C , growth was visually monitored . 
RNA isolation, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and data analysis
To prepare cells for RNA extraction , 5 ml of fresh LB 6 5 % DOC was inoculated with 100 ll from an overnight bacterial culture , and incubated with shaking at 378C . 
Three biological replicates were performed for each strain . 
In exponential cultures ( O.D. 600 0.6 ) , a 2 ml aliquot from cultures in LB was extracted after 1.5 h , and after 3 h in LB 1 5 % DOC ; in stationary phase cultures ( OD 600 2 ) , 2 ml aliquots were extracted from o/n cultures . 
The samples were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm at 48C for 2 min in a 5415 R Eppendorf centrifuge . 
The pellet was washed three times with NaCl 0.9 % and resuspended in 100 ml of a solution of lysozyme ( 3 mg ml21 ) . 
Cell lysis was facilitated by a freeze -- thaw cycle . 
After lysis , RNA was extracted using 1 ml of TRIsure reagent following manufacturer 's instructions ( Bioline ) . 
Total RNA was then resuspended in 30 ml of RNase-free water . 
The quantity and quality of the RNA was determined using a ND-1000 spectro-photometer ( NanoDrop Technologies ) . 
An aliquot of 1 lg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using QuantiTectV R Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) following manufacturer 's instructions . 
Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed in a Light Cycler 480 II apparatus ( Roche ) . 
Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 10 ll on a 480-well optical reaction plate ( Roche ) containing 5 ll SYBR , 0.2 ll DYE II ( Takara ) , 4 ll cDNA ( 1/10 dilution ) and two gene-specific pri-mers at a final concentration of 0.2 mM each . 
Real-time cycling conditions were as follows : ( i ) 958C for 10 min and ( ii ) 40 cycles at 958C for 15 s , 608C for 1 min . 
A non-RT control was included for each primer set . 
Triplicates were run for each reaction , and the Ct value is averaged from them . 
Absence of primer dimers was corroborated by running a dissociation curve at the end of each experiment to determine the melting temperature of the amplicon . 
Melting curve analysis verified that each reaction contained a single PCR product . 
Genespecific primers were designed with Primer3Plus software ( http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus . 
cgi / ) , and are listed in Supporting Information Table S2 . 
For quantification , the efficiency of each primer pair was determined to be between 90 % -- 110 % , following the instructions for efficiency determination described in the ` Guide to Performing Relative Quantification of Gene Expression Using 
Real-Time Quantitative PCR ' ( Applied Biosystems , 2014 ) . 
These efficiencies indicate that the amount of DNA is doubled in each PCR cycle , and allows for direct comparison between different genes . 
Relative RNA levels were determined using the DDCt method as described in the Applied Biosystems manual . 
Briefly , each gene Ct value is normalized to the Ct value for the internal control ( hdfR ) , which provides the DCt value . 
This value is then related to a given gene in the reference strain ( SL1344 , in this case ) , providing the DDCt value . 
Since the amount of DNA doubles in each PCR cycle , the relative amount of input cDNA can be determined by using the formula 2-DDCt . 
Each DDCt determination was performed at least in three different RNA samples ( three biological replicates ) , and the results presented here are representative examples of such determinations . 
The Student 's t test was used to determine whether the differences in RNA content were significant . 
Assessment of efflux pump activity by flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was used to monitor accumulation and efflux of ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) on a real-time basis , a method previously described ( Martins et al. , 2006 ; Viveiros et al. , 2008 ) . 
Data acquisition and analysis were performed using a Cytom-ics FC500-MPL cytometer ( Beckman Coulter ) . 
EtBr ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) was excited at 488 nm , and fluorescence was detected using a 585 nm filter . 
To study AcrAB activity with DOC , exponential cultures of strains SV7636 ( DacrD DmdtK DmdfA DemrA DacrF DmdtA macA : : Km mdsA : : Cm ) and SL1344 were diluted in LB and LB 1 5 % DOC and incubated for 2 h ( for exponential phase ) or overnight ( for stationary phase ) . 
EtBr was then added ( 1 lg ml21 ) and the cultures were incubated for 60 additional minutes at 378C in the dark to permit EtBr accumulation . 
Finally , 0.5 ml of each culture was centrifuged for 3 min at 13 000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate saline buffer for fluorescence measurement . 
Data were collected for 100 000 events per sample , and were analyzed with CXP and FlowJo 10 Software .
