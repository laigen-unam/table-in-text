Vaccination is an important measure to control Salmonella contamination in the meat production chain . 
A previous study showed that both the DrfaJ and DrfaL strains are suitable markers and allow serological differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals . 
The aim of this study was to verify whether deletion of the lon gene in a Salmonella Typhimurium DrfaJ marker strain resulted in decreased environmental survival . 
Our results indicate that deletion of the lon gene in the DrfaJ strain did not affect invasiveness in IPEC-J2 cells and resulted in an increased susceptibility to UV , disinfectants ( such as hydrogen peroxide and tosylchloramide sodium ) and citric acid . 
Immunization of pigs with inactivated DrfaJ or DlonDrfaJ vaccines allowed differentiation of infected and vaccinated pigs . 
Furthermore , deletion of the lon gene did not reduce the protection conferred by live wild type or DrfaJ vaccines against subsequent challenge with a virulent Salmonella Typhimurium strain in BALB/c mice . 
Based on our results in mice , we conclude that deletion of lon in DrfaJ contributes to environmental safety of the DrfaJ DIVA strain .

However , deletion of the lon gene might also severely compromise the protective capacity of a live Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine . 
Therefore , it was the aim of this study to verify whether deletion of the lon gene resulted in a vaccine strain that was more susceptible to environmental stress ( e.g. UV , various disinfection agents ) without affecting the strain 's ability to protect BALB/c mice against a Salmonella Typhimurium infection on the one hand and without loss of its DIVA quality in pigs on the other hand . 
1. Introduction
Vaccination of pigs is an important measure to control Salmo-nella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) contamination in the meat production chain ( Boyen et al. , 2008a ) . 
Live vaccines confer a better protection against Salmonella challenge compared to inactivated vaccines , probably due to the more pronounced cellular immune response and the induction of mucosal IgA production ( Boyen et al. , 2008a ) . 
However , the use of live vaccines can only be advocated if infected and vaccinated animals can be differentiated ; and the vaccine strain is easily eliminated from the environment . 
The ﬁrst condition has recently been met by the development of DIVA ( Differentiation of Infected and Vaccinated Animals ) vaccine strains ( Selke et al. , 2007 ; Leyman et al. , 2011 ) . 
The second condition is of increasing interest in vaccine development since live vaccines are potentially excreted into the environment by the vaccinated animals . 
In this respect , Lon-deﬁcient Salmonella strains that could serve as effective oral vaccines in mammals might decrease survival of live Salmonella Typhimurium vaccines in the environment ( Matsui et al. , 2003 ; Kodama et al. , 2005 ) . 
Lon , as an evolutionarily conserved stress protein induced by multiple stressors , helps to remove damaged and abnormal proteins during stress and contrib-utes to the regulation of cell division , cell morphology and DNA maintenance ( Downs et al. , 1986 ; Takaya et al. , 2002 , 2003 ; Kültz , 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains
Strains and primers used in this study are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . 
Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a , phage type 120 , was originally isolated from a pig stool sample on a farm where pigs were persistently infected with Salmonella and was used as the wild type strain ( Boyen et al. , 2009 ) . 
This strain was also used for the construction of three deletion mutants ( Dlon , DrfaJ ( Leyman et al. , 2011 ) and DlonDrfaJ ) using the one-step inactivation method described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) . 
Live strains ( WT , DrfaJ , Dlon and DlonDrfaJ ) for immunization of mice were prepared as follows . 
Strains were grown overnight on a shaker at 37 C in 100 ml Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Sigma -- Aldrich Chemie Gmbh , Steinheim , Germany ) . 
The bacteria were washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 3500g for 15 min at roo temperature and adjusted in PBS to the appropriate concentration of 2 107 colony forming units per ml ( CFU/ml ) . 
The number of viable bacteria was determined by plating 10-fold dilutions on brilliant green agar ( BGA ) ( International Medical Products , Brussels , Belgium ) . 
For challenge of mice , Salmonella strain NCTC12023 ( Nal20 ) was used .

2.2. Invasiveness in IPEC-J2 cells
As a measure of in vitro virulence , invasiveness of DlonDrfaJ , DrfaJ , wild type and Dlon , was assessed in porcine epithelial cells ( IPEC-J2 ) using a gentamicin protection assay . 
The polarized por-cine epithelial intestinal cell line IPEC-J2 was derived from jejunal epithelium isolated from a neonatal piglet ( Rhoads et al. , 1994 ; Schierack et al. , 2006 ) . 
Cells were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of approximately 105 cells per well and allowed to grow to conﬂuency for at least one day . 
These wells were inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a or one of its isogenic knock-out mutants at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 . 
To synchronize the infection , the inoculated multiwell plates were centri-fuged at 365g for 10 min at 37 C . 
After 30 min incubation at 37 C and 5 % CO2 , the wells were rinsed with 1 ml Hank 's buffered salt solution ( HBSS ) ( Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) and fresh medium supplemented with 50 lg/ml gentamicin ( Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisly , Scotland ) added . 
After 60 min of incubation at 37 C and 5 % CO2 , the wells were rinsed three times with 1 ml HBSS . 
To quantify invasion , the cells were lysed with 0.25 % deoxycholate ( Sigma -- Aldrich Chemie Gmbh , Steinheim , Germany ) 100 min after inoculation and 10-fold dilutions plated on BGA plates . 
The invasion assay was conducted in triplicate with three repeats per experiment . 
2.3. Immunization of piglets
We veriﬁed whether it was possible to serologically discriminate between ( 1 ) pigs immunized with DlonDrfaJ and Salmonella Typhimurium 112910a on the one hand and ( 2 ) pigs immunized with the DlonDrfaJ strain and Salmonella Typhimurium 112910a infected pigs on the other hand . 
For this purpose , twenty-one , six-week-old , bacteriologically and serologically Salmonella negative piglets ( commercial closed line based on Landrace ) were used . 
One and three weeks after their arrival , twelve pigs were inoculated intramuscularly ( IM ) with 1 ml of one of the formalin-inactivated vaccines containing 5 108 CFU/ml ( either Salmonella Typhimurium ( n = 3 ) , DrfaJ ( n = 3 ) , Dlon ( n = 3 ) or DlonDrfaJ ( n = 3 ) ) , prepared as previously described ( Leyman et al. , 2011 ) . 
The control group ( n = 3 ) was inoculated IM with 1 ml of PBS . 
Four weeks after arrival , piglets were sacriﬁed by exsanguination under anesthesia and blood samples obtained and centrifuged at 365 g. To obtain sera from Sal-monella Typhimurium infected piglets , six piglets were experimentally infected with Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a , as described previously ( Leyman et al. , 2011 ) . 
All serum samples were examined using an LPS based IDEXX enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( HerdChek Salmonella ; IDEXX Laboratories , Schiphol-Rijk , Noord-Holland , The Netherlands ) and an in-house Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a whole cell ELISA , prepared as previously described ( Leyman et al. , 2011 ) . 
2.4. Sensitivity of the DlonDrfaJ strain to ultraviolet light
The impact of the deletion of the lon gene , both in the wild type strain and its isogenic DrfaJ mutant , on the strain 's survival to UV was evaluated . 
For the UV-resistance test , strains were grown overnight on a shaker at 37 C and were diluted in PBS to 108 CFU/ml . 
From each suspension , 100 ll was transferred to a 96 well plate and exposed to 0 , 30 or 60 s of ultraviolet radiation ( Sylvania Germicidal lamp , UV-C : 253.7 nm , distance : 15 cm , 15 W ) . 
The number of viable bacteria was determined by plating 10-fold dilutions on Colombia agar ( Sigma -- Aldrich Chemie Gmbh , Steinheim , Germany ) containing 5 % sheep blood ( Biotrading , Mijdrecht , Nederland ) . 
2.5. Sensitivity to various disinfection agents and acidic conditions
Strains were grown overnight on a shaker at 37 C in LB broth and then incubated at room temperature in the presence of the following stressors for the indicated times : 15 mM hydrogen peroxide for 75 min ; 20 % ethanol for 5 min ; 1 mM tosylchloramide sodium ( SA Fagron NV , Waregem , Belgium ) for 15 min , and citric acid ( 50 mM , pH 3.0 ) for 50 min and 150 min ( Gruzdev et al. , 2001 ) . 
Following exposure , survival of Salmonella was veriﬁed by plating 10-fold dilutions on Colombia agar containing 5 % sheep blood . 
2.6. Immunization and challenge of mice
Animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientiﬁc Purposes . 
The experimental protocols and care of the animals were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Ghent University ( EC 2009/57 ) . 
To verify whether deletion of lon in DrfaJ or the wild type strain affects the strain 's protective capacity , ﬁfty , ﬁve-week-old , speciﬁe pathogen-free ( SPF ) BALB/c mice ( Bio services , Janvier , France ) were used to compare the clinical protection of DlonDrfaJ with DrfaJ on the one hand and Dlon with the wild type strain on the other hand . 
Mice were immunized via the orogastric route with 2 107 CFU/ml of either Dlon ( n = 10 ) , DlonDrfaJ ( n = 10 ) , DrfaJ ( n = 10 ) or Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a ( n = 10 ) . 
A control group of ten mice was sham-inoculated with sterile PBS . 
Four weeks after arrival all mice were challenged with 108 CFU/ml of the virulent Salmonella Typhimurium strain NCTC12023Nal20 by the orogastric route . 
Nine days post-infection , samples of spleen , li-ver and caecum were examined quantitatively for the presence of the challenge organisms . 
Samples were weighed and 10 % ( w/v ) suspensions made in buffered peptone water ( BPW ) ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) after which the material was homogenized with a stomacher . 
The homogenized samples were examined for the presence of Salmonella by plating 10-fold dilutions on BGA supplemented with nalidixic acid ( BGANAL20 ) . 
If negative at direct plating , the samples were pre-enriched overnight in BPW at 37 C , enriched overnight at 37 C in tetrathionate broth and then plated on BGA-NAL . 
Samples negative after direct plating but positive after enrichment were presumed to contain 60 CFU per gram tissue ( detection limit for direct plating ) . 
Samples that remained negative were presumed to contain 0 CFU per gram tissue .

Serological results of pigs immunized with either Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a , Dlon , DrfaJ , or DlonDrfaJ , control animals ( animals that were not immunized ) and pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910aNal20 when using an LPS based IDEXX ELISA ( white bars ) and a Salmonella Typhimurium whole cell ELISA ( black bars ) . 
Values are represented as a percentage compared to the Salmonella Typhimurium immunized group . 
3.1 . 
Deletion of lon results in an increased invasiveness in IPEC-J2 cells 
Invasion of all strains was compared in IPEC-J2 cells using a gentamicin protection assay . 
The Dlon strains were not impaired in invasiveness compared to the wild type strain and the DrfaJ strain . 
Although an elevated invasion was noticed for the lon deﬁcient strains , invasion rates of all strains were not signiﬁcantly different in IPEC-2 cells ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Bacterial numbers for the mutant strains recovered in the invasion assay were not affected by the detergent 0.25 % deoxycholate ( data not shown ) . 
3.2. Deletion of lon does not affect the serological response after immunization of pigs
Serum samples of pigs immunized with rfaJ deﬁcient strains ( DlonDrfaJ ( n = 3 ) or DrfaJ ( n = 3 ) ) and control animals ( animals that were not immunized , n = 3 ) were considered Salmonella negative when using a commercially available IDEXX ELISA . 
Pigs immunized with Dlon ( n = 3 ) or Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a ( n = 3 ) and Salmonella infected animals ( n = 4 ) were considered seropositive for Salmonella in the IDEXX ELISA test . 
Results are shown in Fig. 2 . 
Piglets immunized with either : Dlon , DrfaJ , DlonDrfaJ or Salmo-nella Typhimurium 112910a and infected animals were all positive for anti-Salmonella antibodies when using a Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910a whole-cell ELISA , while non immunized control animals were seronegative ( Fig. 2 ) . 
3.3 . 
Deletion of lon increases susceptibility to UV , various disinfection agents and acidic conditions 
The lon deﬁcient strains were highly susceptible to ultraviolet light compared to the DrfaJ strain on the one hand and to the wild type strain on the other hand , with a signiﬁcant reduction ( P < 0.05 ) in the number of surviving cells at 1 min exposure ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Furthermore , the Dlon strains ( Dlon and DlonDrfaJ ) were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide , ethanol , chloraminum and citric acid compared to the DrfaJ and the wild type strains . 
The DlonDrfaJ strain survived exposure to 15 mM hydrogen peroxide for 75 min , with a 0.7 log reduction ( P < 0.05 ) compared to the DrfaJ strain . 
The Dlon strain survived exposure to 15 mM hydrogen peroxide for 75 min , with a 0.8 log reduction ( P < 0.05 ) compared to the wild type strain . 
Results are shown in Fig. 4 . 
All strains were sensitive to exposure to 20 % ethanol , only a 0.2 log reduction ( P > 0.05 ) in survival of DlonDrfaJ was seen compared to the DrfaJ strain . 
Results are not shown . 
The DlonDrfaJ strain survived exposure to tosylchloramide sodium for 15 min , with a 0.4 log reduction ( P < 0.05 ) compared to the DrfaJ strain . 
The number of surviving cells of Dlon was reduced compared t the wild type strain . 
However , this reduction was not signiﬁcant ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Results are shown in Fig. 5 . 
The Dlon strains showed a signiﬁcant reduction ( P < 0.05 ) in survival compared to the DrfaJ and the wild type strains when exposed to 50 mM citric acid for 150 min ( Fig. 6 ) . 
3.4. DlonDrfaJ and DrfaJ equally protect mice against Salmonella Typhimurium 112910a
All strains were able to signiﬁcantly ( P < 0.05 ) reduce bacterial counts in the spleen and liver of BALB/c mice compared to control animals . 
The rfaJ deﬁcient strains ( DlonDrfaJ and DrfaJ ) were equally able to protect mice against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge . 
Only the wild type strain was able to signiﬁcantly ( P < 0.05 ) reduce bacterial counts in the caeca of mice . 
Results are shown in Fig. 7 . 
4. Discussion and conclusions
Several attenuated live vaccine candidates against Salmonella Typhimurium have been investigated in the past two decades ( Nagy et al. , 2006 ) . 
One major drawback , that vaccinated pigs produce antibodies against the vaccine strain and therefore are no longer distinguishable from ﬁeld-exposed animals by serological tests , was overcome by using DIVA marker strains , such as DrfaJ ( Leyman et al. , 2011 ) and DlonDrfaJ , as proven in this study . 
Our study conﬁrmed that deletion of the lon gene does not inﬂuence invasiveness in IPEC-J2 cells compared to its isogenic wild type strain , indicating that lon deﬁcient strains might colonize their host cells to the extent that they are able to elicit a protective immune response . 
The use of susceptible mice in combination wit a highly virulent challenge strain , allowed us to conﬁrm that DlonDrfaJ successfully protects BALB/c mice against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge in both spleen and liver and that the strain 's protective capacity was not impaired compared to the DrfaJ DIVA strain . 
However , only the wild type strain was able to signiﬁcantly reduce bacterial counts in the caeca of mice compared to unvaccinated control animals , highlighting that the deletion mutants used in this study were partially attenuated in their ability to protect against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge . 
Moreover , more research will be necessary to investigate in vivo persistence of Dlon strains in both mice and pigs . 
Disruption of the lon gene in DrfaJ increased susceptibility of the DrfaJ strain to environmental stress . 
Sensitivity of DlonDrfaJ and Dlon to ultraviolet light is explained by the overproduction of oxygen species , leading to oxidative damage and the accumulation of naturally unstable proteins , such as SulA , a cell division inhibitor produced after DNA damage ( Schoemaker et al. , 1984 ) . 
Furthermore , our study conﬁrmed that Lon , as primary ATP-depen-dent quality control protease , is required to resist many types of stress , such as disinfection agents and citric acid . 
Thus , deletion of lon could signiﬁcantly contribute to decreased environmental persistence of live vaccine strains . 
Based on our ﬁndings , we summarize that deletion of the lon gene in the DrfaJ strain allows differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals ; does not inﬂuence the protective capacity of the DrfaJ strain in BALB/c mice ; and results in an increased susceptibility to ultraviolet light , disinfection agents and citric acid . 
Therefore , we conclude that deletion of lon in DrfaJ increases the susceptibility of live Salmonella Typhimurium vaccines to some environmental stresses .
