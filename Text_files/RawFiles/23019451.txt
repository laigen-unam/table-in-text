Abstract 
A series of methoxy and deoxy derivatives of mannopyranose-1-phosphate ( Manp-1P ) were chemically synthesized , and their ability to be converted into the corresponding guanosine diphosphate mannopyranose ( GDP-Manp ) analogues by a pyrophosphorylase ( GDP-ManPP ) from Salmonella enterica was studied . 
Evaluation of methoxy analogues demonstrated that GDP-ManPP is intolerant of bulky substituents at the C-2 , C-3 , and C-4 positions , in turn suggesting that these positions are buried inside the enzyme active site . 
Additionally , both the 6-methoxy and 6-deoxy Manp-1P derivatives are good or moderate substrates for GDP-ManPP , thus indicating that the C-6 hydroxy group of the Manp-1P substrate is not required for binding to the enzyme . 
When taken into consideration with other previously published work , it appears that this enzyme has potential utility for the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of GDP-Manp analogues , which are useful probes for studying enzymes that employ this sugar nucleotide as a substrate . 
Introduction
Modified sugar nucleotide analogues are valuable probes to study glycosyltransferases and other enzymes that use these activated glycosylating agents as substrates [ 1-5 ] . 
The synthesis of natural and non-natural sugar nucleotides is therefore a topic of continuing interest [ 6 ] . 
The classical method for chemically synthesizing sugar nucleotides involves the preparation of a sugar 1-phosphate derivative followed by its coupling to an activated nucleoside monophosphate to form the key pyrophosphate moiety ( Figure 1A ) [ 7 ] . 
In general , the yield of this process is low , and the purification of the product can be tedious ; hence , the development of new methods to prepare sugar nucleotides remains an area of active research [ 6 ] . 
Although improved chemical methods have been developed [ 8-13 ] , another attractive strategy is to employ a chemo-enzymatic approach , in which a synthetic sugar 1-phosphate derivative is converted to the sugar nucleotide by a pyrophosphorylase ( Figure 1B ) [ 14,15 ] . 
This approach is increasingly used for the synthesis of sugar nucleotides , but a limitation is that the specificity of the pyrophosphorylase must be sufficiently broad to recognize the synthetic sugar 1-phos-phate derivative . 
However , some of these enzymes have been demonstrated to have broad specificity , or can be engineered to have broad specificity , with regard to both the sugar 1-phos-phate and nucleotide substrates [ 16-19 ] . 
As part of a larger study on the specificity of mannosyltransferases involved in mycobacterial glycan biosynthesis [ 20-22 ] , we had the need for a panel of singly deoxygenated and methylated guanosine diphosphosphate mannopyranose ( GDP-Man ) derivatives . 
In developing a strategy for the synthesis of these compounds , we chose to take advantage of a GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase ( GDP-ManPP ) from Salmonella enterica [ 23 ] , which had previously been shown to have a relaxed specificity for the sugar 1-phos-phate moiety [ 24,25 ] . 
In particular , it has been shown that the enzyme will accept mannopyranosyl 1-phosphate ( Manp-1P ) derivatives deoxygenated at C-2 , C-3 and C-4 ( 1 -- 3 , Figure 2 ) , as well as a substrate lacking the hydroxymethyl group at C-5 ( 4 ) [ 24 ] . 
A series monoazido derivatives ( 5 -- 8 ) were also shown to be substrates [ 25 ] . 
To further probe the potential of this enzyme for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified GDP-Manp derivatives , we describe here the preparation of all four singly methylated Manp-1P analogues 9 -- 12 , as well as the 6-deoxy-Manp-1P derivative 13 , and an initial evaluation of their ability to serve as a substrate for S. enterica GDP-ManPP . 
Results and Discussion
Synthesis of 2-methoxy derivative 9 The synthesis of sugar 1-phosphate 9 containing a methyl group at O-2 commenced from 3-O-benzyl-4 ,6 - O-benzylidene-α-D-mannopyranoside 14 [ 26 ] as illustrated in Scheme 1 . 
Methyl-ation of the alcohol under standard conditions proceeded in 80 % yield affording 15 . 
The benzylidene protecting group was cleaved , together with the methyl glycoside , by acetolysis giving the tetra-O-acetylated compound 16 in 81 % yield . 
This glycosyl acetate was converted to the corresponding thioglycoside ( 17 ) , which was , in turn , coupled with dibenzyl phosphate under NIS -- AgOTf activation conditions , providing compound 18 in 55 % yield over two steps from 16 . 
The anomeric stereochemistry in 18 was confirmed by the magnitude of the 1JC1 , H1 , which was 177.9 Hz , consistent with α-stereochemistry as described earlier by Timmons and Jakeman for rhamnopyranosyl phosphates [ 27 ] . 
In the other phosphorylation reactions reported in this paper , the anomeric stereochemistry was determined in an analogous manner . 
Compound 18 was then deprotected in two steps , namely catalytic hydrogenolysis and then , without further purification , treatment with a mixture of CH3OH -- H2O -- Et3N 5:2:1 to remove the acetyl groups . 
This series of reactions gave 2-methoxy Manp-1P analogue 9 in 92 % overall yield from 18 .

Synthesis of 3-methoxy derivative 10 The preparation of the 3-methoxy Manp-1P analogue 10 followed a route similar to that used for the synthesis of 9 ( Scheme 2 ) . 
Methyl 2-O-benzyl-4 ,6 - O-benzylidene-α-D-mannopyranoside ( 19 ) [ 26 ] was first methylated giving 20 and then converted into glycosyl acetate 21 in 49 % yield over the two steps . 
Subsequent thioglycosylation provided a 52 % yield of 22 . 
The protected dibenzyl phosphate 23 was next formed by the NIS -- AgOTf promoted glycosylation of dibenzyl phosphate with 22 , which afforded the desired compound , 23 , in 75 % yield . 
Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl groups and deacylation led to the formation , in 67 % yield , of Manp-1P derivative 10 . 
Synthesis of 4-methoxy derivative 11 As illustrated in Scheme 3 , the synthesis of the 4-methoxy Manp-1P analogue 11 started by treatment of methyl α-D-mannopyranoside ( 24 ) with trityl chloride in pyridine . 
The product , 25 , was then converted to the isopropylidene acetal 26 in 65 % overall yield from 24 . 
The hydroxy group in 26 was methylated under standard conditions ( CH3I , NaH ) to give the 4-methoxy analogue 27 in 91 % yield . 
Acetolysis of 27 to the corresponding glycosyl acetate 28 , followed by reaction with ethanethiol and BF3 · OEt2 , yielded thioglycoside 29 , in a modest 39 % yield from 27 over two steps . 
This compound was then converted to 11 , in 56 % yield , as outlined above , by successive phosphorylation and deprotection .

Synthesis of 6-methoxy derivative 12 Two routes , differing in the choice of protecting groups , were explored to produce the 6-methoxy Manp-1P derivative 12 ( Scheme 4 and Scheme 5 ) . 
In one route , the C-2 , C-3 , and C-4 hydroxy groups of the mannose residues were protected with benzyl ethers and in the other they were protected with benzoyl esters . 
The overall yields of these two methods were 30 % and 17 % , respectively . 
In the first method ( Scheme 4 ) , the initial step was the conversion , in 78 % yield , of the fully acetylated thioglycoside 31 [ 28 ] into silyl ether 32 by treatment with sodium methoxide and then tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane in DMF . 
Benzylation of 32 using benzyl bromide and sodium hydride gave 33 in 84 % yield . 
The TBDPS group was then cleaved and replaced with a methyl group to give the 6-methoxy compound 35 in 72 % yield over two steps . 
The protected dibenzyl phosphate 36 was formed in 70 % yield by phosphorylation as described for the synthesis of 9 -- 11 . 
Catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of NaHCO3 was used to cleave all the benzyl groups , which gave the 6-methoxy Manp-1P derivative 12 in 91 % yield . 
The second route to 12 began with methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl - α-D-mannopyranoside ( 37 ) [ 29 ] and is illustrated in Scheme 5 . 
Methylation of the free OH , even under mildly basic conditions ( e.g. , Ag2O -- CaSO4 ) , led to significant amounts of acyl group migration , and the desired product was obtained in only 52 % yield . 
Nevertheless , enough material was produced to move forward . 
Acetolysis conditions were used to replace the methyl group at the anomeric center in 38 with an acetyl group , resulting in a 96 % yield of 39 . 
Thioglycosylation , followed by coupling of the resulting thioglycoside donor 40 ( obtained in 75 % yield ) with dibenzyl phosphate , gave phosphate 41 in a yield of 67 % over the two steps . 
The 6-methoxy Manp-1P analogue 12 was obtained by catalytic hydrogeno-lysis of the benzyl ethers followed by treatment with CH3OH -- H2O -- Et3N 5:2:1 providing 12 in 85 % yield over two steps . 
Synthesis of 6-deoxy derivative 13
The synthesis of the 6-deoxy Manp-1P analogue 13 used an intermediate ( 37 ) prepared in the course of the synthesis of the 6-methoxy analogue ( Scheme 6 ) . 
First , the hydroxy group of 37 was converted to the corresponding iodide in 65 % yield , by using triphenylphospine and iodine . 
The product , 42 , was then subjected to acetolysis and catalytic hydrogenation , which gave 6-deoxy glycosyl acetate derivative 43 in 72 % yield . 
The subsequent thioglycosylation , phosphorylation and deprotection steps proceeded , as outlined above , to give the 6-deoxy Manp-1P 13 in 43 % yield over four steps .

Evaluation of 9 -- 13 as substrates for GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase With 9 -- 13 in hand , each was evaluated as a substrate for the S. enterica GDP-ManPP . 
Before doing that , the recombinant protein was produced and the natural substrate for the enzyme , Manp-1P ( 46 , Figure 3 ) , was evaluated by incubation with the enzyme and GTP . 
The reaction was monitored by HPLC ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information File 1 ) and stopped when the complete consumption of GTP was observed . 
Simultaneous with the loss of the GTP was the appearance of the signal for a new product , which was found to elute at a retention time similar to that for an authentic sample of GDP-Manp . 
The product was isolated , and analysis by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed an ion with m/z = 604.0691 , which corresponds to the [ M − H ] − ion ( calcd m/z = 604.0699 ) of GDP-Manp . 
Having established that the enzyme GDP-ManPP was active , we carried out the same incubations for 9 -- 13 , and in all cases the corresponding GDP-Manp analogue peaks could be observed ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information File 1 ) . 
However , in the case of 11 and 9 , a peak corresponding to GDP , resulting from hydrolysis of the GDP-sugar , was also observed , and , in the case of 9 , a much smaller amount of the GDP-Manp analogue was produced . 
To confirm the identity of each GDP-Manp analogue , the product peaks were isolated and analysed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . 
For the reactions involving 9 -- 12 a signal at m/z ≈ 618 was observed , as would be expected for the [ M − H ] − ion of the methylated GDP-Man derivatives ( 48 -- 51 , Figure 4 ) . 
Similarly , for the reaction with 13 , a signal at m/z ≈ 588 was observed in the mass spectrum consistent with the 6-deoxy GDP-Man derivative 52 . 
Relative activity of Manp-1P analogues with GDP-ManPP After it was established that all five Manp-1P analogues could serve as substrates for GDP-ManPP , the relative activity with each was assessed . 
This was done by using an established colorimetric activity assay , which relies on the detection of the pyrophosphate ( PPi , Figure 3 ) formed as a byproduct of the enzymatic reaction [ 30 ] . 
As illustrated in Figure 5 , all five synthetic derivatives 9 -- 13 were active as substrates , although at lower levels than the parent compound 46 . 
The 6-methoxy ( 12 ) and 6-deoxy ( 13 ) analogues , demonstrated moderate to good relative activities , while the 2-methoxy ( 9 ) , 3-methoxy ( 10 ) , and 4-methoxy ( 11 ) compounds showed much lower activities . 
For example , the 2-methoxy , 3-methoxy , and 4-methoxy analogues displayed a 6 - , 14 - , and 17-fold decrease relative to 46 , respect-ively . 
Because both the 6-deoxy and 6-methoxy analogues ( 12 and 13 ) showed relatively good activity it is likely that this hydroxy group does not interact significantly with the enzyme . 
On the other hand , because the 2-methoxy , 3-methoxy , and 4-methoxy compounds all showed a large decrease in activity , it is likely that these positions are bound tightly in the active site of the enzyme . 
A graphical summary of the substrate specificity for GDP-ManPP is shown in Figure 6 .

Kinetic analysis of Manp-1P analogues with GDP-ManPP To better understand how these 9 -- 13 interact with GDP-ManPP , kinetic analyses were performed by using the colorimetric activity assay mentioned above ( Table 1 ) . 
Both the 6-methoxy Manp-1P ( 12 ) and 6-deoxy Manp-1P ( 13 ) derivatives bind relatively well to the enzyme , showing only a two - or three-fold increase in KM , respectively , compared to the native Manp-1P donor 46 . 
The turnover rate of 6-methoxy analogue 12 is , however , much lower than the 6-deoxy counterpart ( 13 ) and the natural substrate 46 , as substantiated by a greater than 10-fold decrease in kcat . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the C-6 hydroxy group does not engage in any critical hydrogen-bonding interactions and that a bulky substituent interferes with the rate of substrate turnover . 
The binding of the 2-methoxy ( 9 ) and 4-methoxy ( 11 ) analogues is very weak compared to the native substrate , as seen by the greater then 100-fold increase in KM ; consequently , the turnover rates are also low . 
The binding between 3-methoxy analogue 10 is moderate , with only a five-fold increase in the observed KM , but it shows an extremely low turnover rate . 
These results all suggest that GDP-ManPP is not tolerant of bulky substituents at the C-2 , C-3 , and C-4 positions , which is consistent with the results obtained from their relative activity . 
It should be noted that these trends are consistent with earlier studies of the enzyme using deoxygenated or azido analogues [ 24,25 ] .

Conclusion
In this paper , we report the synthesis of a panel of methoxy and deoxy analogues of Manp-1P . 
Five analogues , 9 -- 13 , in which one of the hydroxy groups was methylated or deoxygenated were generated by chemical synthesis , and the ability of these compounds to be converted to the corresponding GDP-Manp analogues by GDP-ManPP from S. enterica was evaluated . 
All the derivatives acted as substrates for GDP-ManPP , but with uniformly lower activity than the natural substrate Man-1P . 
The results suggest that the C-2 , C-3 , and C-4 hydroxy groups of Manp-1P are bound within the active site of GDP-ManPP and the addition of a methyl group at these positions is tolerated very poorly . 
Conversely , the addition of a methyl group to , or deoxygenation of , O-6 had a much smaller effect , suggesting that this position protrudes from the active site , or is accommodated in a pocket that can tolerate either of these modifications . 
These results are consistent with earlier studies of this enzyme , which were focused on deoxygenated and azido derivatives [ 24,25 ] . 
Considered together , our studies and those published previously suggest that this enzyme can be used to access deoxy and azido derivatives of GDP-Man on a preparative scale , but that the synthesis of analogues containing more sterically demanding groups is likely to be only possible when the modifications are present on O-6 .
