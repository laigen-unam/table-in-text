Summary
The O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is a virulence factor in enterobacterial infections , and the advantage of its genetic loss in the lethal pathogen Yersinia pestis has remained unresolved . 
Y. pestis and Salmonella enterica express b-barrel surface proteases of the omptin family that activate human plasminogen . 
Plasminogen activation is central in pathogenesis of plague but has not , however , been found to be important in diarrhoeal disease . 
We observed that the presence of O-antigen repeats on wild-type or recombinant S. enterica , Yersinia pseudotuberculosis or Escherichia coli prevents plasminogen activation by PgtE of S. enterica and Pla of Y. pestis ; the O-antigen did not affect incorporation of the omptins into the bacterial outer membrane . 
Puriﬁed His6-Pla was successfully reconstituted with rough LPS but remained inactive after reconstitution with smooth LPS . 
Expression of smooth LPS prevented Pla-mediated adhesion of recombinant E. coli to basement membrane as well as invasion into human endothelial cells . 
Similarly , the presence of an O-antigen prevented PgtE-mediated bacterial adhesion to basement membrane . 
Substitution of Arg-138 and Arg-171 of the motif for protein binding to lipid A 4 cents - phosphate abolished proteolytic activity but not membrane translocation of PgtE , indicating dependence of omptin activity on a speciﬁc interaction with lipid A . 
The results suggest that Pla and PgtE require LPS for activity and that the O-antigen sterically

prevents recognition of large-molecular-weight substrates . 
Loss of O-antigen facilitates Pla functions and invasiveness of Y. pestis ; on the other hand , smooth LPS renders plasminogen activator cryptic in S. enterica . 
Introduction
Plague is an acute zoonotic disease estimated to have caused 200 million deaths throughout recorded history , yet the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis still persists endemically in many countries and causes local outbreaks ( reviewed by Perry and Fetherston , 1997 ) . 
Plague is usually transmitted to humans subcutaneously by the bite of a ﬂea that acquired the bacterium from infected rodents . 
The bacterium spreads from the site of the ﬂea bite to the regional lymph nodes and then to the bloodstream . 
Y. pestis survives within human phagocytic and epithelial cells , but extracellular growth predominates during systemic phases of the infection . 
High proteolytic activity ( Sodeinde et al. , 1992 ) and ability to multiply in the ﬂea midgut ( Hinnebusch et al. , 2002 ) are important virulence determinants for plague . 
Pathogenic bacteria intervene by various mechanisms with the mammalian proteolytic plasminogen/plasmin system to use it for tissue invasion or nutritional requirements ( reviewed by Lähteenmäki et al. , 2001a ) . 
Y. pestis expresses the Pla surface protease that is an efﬁcient activator of plasminogen ( Plg ; Sodeinde and Goguen , 1989 ) , and the central roles of Pla and Plg in the pathogenesis of plague have been well established ( Sodeinde et al. , 1992 ; Goguen et al. , 2000 ) . 
Pla is encoded on the Y. pestis-speciﬁc plasmid pPCP1 ( Brubaker et al. , 1965 ) and belongs to the omptin family of enterobacterial aspartate proteases . 
Pla also degrades the main circulating inhibitor of plasmin , a2-antiplasmin ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) and is a laminin-speciﬁc adhesin ( Lähteenmäki et al. , 1998 ) . 
Together , these properties create localized , uncontrolled proteolysis that enhances spread of Y. pestis from the subcutaneous infection site into the blood circulation . 
Pla also mediates bacterial invasion into cultured human cells ( Cowan et al. , 2000 ; Lähteenmäki et al. , 2001b ) and degrades the C3 component of complement ( Sodeinde et al. , 1992 ) , which may also contribute to the establishment of systemic infection . 
The roles that omptins play in the virulence of other enterobacterial species appear to be less dramatic . 
SopA of Shigella ﬂexneri increases bacterial virulence indirectly by processing the IcsA protein needed for actin-based motility within eukaryotic cells ( Egile et al. , 1997 ; Shere et al. , 1997 ) . 
PgtE of Salmonella enterica cleaves an 18-residue cationic antimicrobial peptide , and OmpT of Escherichia coli cleaves protamine ( Stumpe et al. , 1998 ; Guina et al. , 2000 ) , which may contribute to bacterial resistance to innate immunological defence within mac-rophages or at epithelial surfaces . 
Recombinant PgtE has been found to activate Plg , but the activity has not been detected in clinical isolates of S. enterica ( Sodeinde and Goguen , 1989 ; Lähteenmäki et al. , 1995 ) , and the roles of Plg activation and localized proteolysis in pathogenesis of salmonellosis have remained open . 
This is surprising in view of the hypothesis that pla originates from the chromosomal pgtE gene of S. enterica and has been acquired by Y. pestis by lateral gene transfer ( Sodeinde and Goguen , 1989 ) . 
The omptins share ª50 % sequence identity , and recent crystal structure resolution ( Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ) and topology modelling ( Kramer et al. , 2000 ; Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) have indicated that they are membrane-embedded , antiparallel-oriented b-barrels ( see structure models of Pla and PgtE in Supplementary material , Fig . 
S1 ) . 
The active-site residues and the resi-dues affecting substrate recognition are located in ﬁve short loops protruding from the bacterial outer membrane . 
The omptins cleave substrates after basic residues , but subtle substitutions or deletions in the surface loops alter substrate speciﬁcity of the omptins towards Plg , antiproteases and low-molecular-mass substrates ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
This exempliﬁes how the omptins may have evolved with and affect the lifestyle of their host bacterium . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is the immunodominant mol-ecule on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria . 
In its smooth form , LPS consists of the structurally variable O-speciﬁc polysaccharide ( O-antigen ; Oag ) that is mostly furnished by oligosaccharide repeating units and is covalently linked to the more conserved core oligosaccharide that substitutes the lipid A. Oag is an important virulence factor of a range of enterobacterial pathogens , including the human enteropathogens S. enterica , Yers-inia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , and mediates resistance to complement-mediated and phagocytic killing of bacteria ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Mecsas et al. , 2001 ; reviewed by Rautemaa and Meri , 1999 ) . 
The genome of Y. pestis carries mutations in the genes encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of Oag ; thus , the bacterium possesses a short-chain , rough type of LPS ( Skurnik et al. , 2000 ) . 
Y. pestis is a highly successful invasive pathogen , and the nature of the selective advantage of the loss of Oag has remained unexplained ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) .

LPS affects the folding and assembly of outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria ( Ried et al. , 1990 ; Sen and Nikaido , 1991 ) . 
The transmembrane bbarrel conformation identiﬁed for omptins is restricted to outer membrane proteins ( Koebnik et al. , 2000 ) , and a structural model for a b-barrel -- LPS interaction was provided by the crystal structure of FhuA of E. coli with bound LPS ( Ferguson et al. , 1998 ) . 
The FhuA structure contains four basic amino acids on one side of the b-barrel that bind to lipid A phosphates in the LPS molecule , and a highly similar three-dimensional structure has been detected in other prokaryotic or eukaryotic proteins that bind to LPS ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ) . 
The crystal structure of the FhuA -- LPS complex also showed at least two further residues that make contact with lipid A ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ) . 
In vitro folding of OmpT into an enzymatically active form was recently found to require LPS ( Kramer et al. , 2002 ) , and the LPS-binding motif of Ferguson et al. ( 2000 ) is partially present in correct three-dimensional organization in the omptin b-barrel ( Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ) . 
These residues are also conserved in Pla and PgtE and are predicted to bind to phosphates in lipid A ( see Supplementary material ) . 
We report here that virulence-associated functions of Pla and PgtE require rough LPS but are inhibited by Oag . 
This most probably contributes to the decisive role of Pla proteolysis in plague as well as to the minor role of Plg activation in the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections . 
Results
Expression of Plg activation by S. enterica
The ability of S. enterica to activate Plg has remained controversial ( Sodeinde and Goguen , 1989 ; Lähteenmäki et al. , 1995 ) . 
Our initial measurement of endogenous Plg activation in clinical isolates of S. enterica revealed that rough strains exhibited , on average , higher levels of activation than smooth strains . 
As examples , Plg activation by the isolate SL1102 with an Re type of rough LPS as well as by the smooth , commonly used virulent strain 14028 are shown in Fig. 1A . 
Strain SL1102 exhibited Plg activation , whereas strain 14028 failed to show detectable activity . 
Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis showed the presence of the pgtE gene in both strains , and immunoblotting of cell envelope proteins with anti-His6-PgtE antibodies revealed a similar expression level of PgtE in cell envelopes of both strains ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Site-spe-ciﬁc deletion of pgtE was constructed in both strains , and the deletion derivatives SL1102-1 and 14028-1 were negative for Plg activation and PgtE expression ( Fig. 1A and B ) . 
To conﬁrm the function of PgtE as a Plg activator , the deletion derivatives were complemented with pgtE cloned behind the inducible trc promoter in plasmid pMRK3 and tested for Plg activation . 
The activity was high in strain SL1102-1 ( pMRK3 ) and clearly lower in strain 14028-1 ( pMRK3 ) ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The catalytic residues in omptins are conserved ( see the structures of Pla and PgtE in Supplementary material ) . 
We next substituted the catalytic resi-due Asp-206 of PgtE into Ala-206 , and the resulting plasmid pMRK31 did not confer Plg activation on SL1102-1 cells ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The PgtE expression levels in cell enve-lopes were , however , similar in all complementation deriv-atives ( Fig. 1B ) . 
These studies indicated that PgtE indeed functions as a proteolytic activator of Plg and that Plg activation by PgtE is efﬁcient only in rough Salmonella . 
To estimate 
Bacterial plasminogen activators and LPS 217 the critical length of the Oag chain needed to inhibit Plg activation , we also expressed pMRK3 in the well-characterized S. enterica mutant series containing LPS molecules of different length ( Schmidt and Lüderitz , 1969 ) . 
The bacteria were cultivated under conditions in which their endogenous PgtE activity was very low , as shown for strain SF1119 ( pSE380 ) possessing an Rc LPS ( Fig. 1C ) . 
The strains with rough-type LPS ( chemotypes Ra to Re in order of decreasing size of the core region length ) supported Plg activation by pMRK3 , the strain with a semi-rough LPS ( SR ; possessing one Oag repeat ) was slightly decreased , whereas the smooth strain with a long Oag exhibited low Plg activation similar to the control strain with the vector pSE380 alone ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Immunob-lotting with anti-His6-PgtE antibodies of the bacterial cell wall proteins showed that the expression levels of PgtE in the outer membranes were similar in the recombinant strains ( Fig. 1D ) . 
These results also indicated that the low level of Plg activation in the smooth strain of S. enterica did not result from poor incorporation of PgtE into the outer membrane and that Oag repeats are needed for inhibition . 
Plg activation by Pla is affected by the LPS type Yersinia pestis has evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis O1b ( Achtman et al. , 1999 ; Skurnik et al. , 2000 ) , which exhibits temperature-sensitive Oag expression ( Bengo-echea et al. , 1998 ) . 
Y. pseudotuberculosis cultivated at 25 ∞ C has a smooth LPS with Oag , whereas cells cultivated at 37 ∞ C lack the Oag . 
Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates lack pla , which has however been successfully 
A. Plasminogen activation by the isolates , their DpgtE as well as complementation derivatives are shown .

expressed in Y. pseudotuberculosis ( Kutyrev et al. , 1999 ) . 
We transformed pMRK1 into the pYV-cured O1b strains Pa3606 and PB1of Y. pseudotuberculosis , which were cultivated at 25 ∞ C and 37 ∞ C . 
The Pa3606 ( pMRK1 ) cells cultivated at 37 ∞ C exhibited efﬁcient Plg activation , whereas cells from 25 ∞ C failed to show activity ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Western blotting indicated that both cells expressed equivalent levels of Pla that was similarly autoprocessed ( Fig. 2A ) . 
An aliquot of both cell cultures was cultivated for 5 h at both 25 ∞ C and 37 ∞ C ; the cells shifted from 25 ∞ C to 37 ∞ C exhibited an increased ability to activate Plg , whereas the reverse was observed with cells shifted from 37 ∞ C to 25 ∞ C ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Visualization of LPS by electro-phoresis and silver staining conﬁrmed the expected rough and smooth LPS type on the bacteria from 25 ∞ C and 37 ∞ C ( not shown ) . 
After cultivation at 25 ∞ C , the rough Dwb derivative of Y. pseudotuberculosis PB1 showed greatly enhanced Plg activation , whereas the mutation had only a marginal effect in cells cultivated at 37 ∞ C ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Again , no signiﬁcant differences in the amounts of the Pla proteins in the cell walls were detected ( not shown ) . 
Kramer et al. ( 2000 ; 2002 ) have shown that puriﬁed OmpT can be successfully reconstituted in the presence of LPS . 
To obtain direct evidence for an effect of LPS type on Pla functions , we subjected Pla to the reconstitution procedure of Kramer et al. ( 2000 ; 2002 ) with the detergent N-dodecyl-N , N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulpho-nate ( DodMe2NPrSO3 ) , using increasing concentrations of smooth or Re LPS from S. enterica . 
His6-Pla puriﬁed under denaturing conditions was reconstituted to an active form with increasing amounts of the Re LPS , whereas reconstitution with smooth LPS gave activity close to the level seen with the detergent control ( Fig. 2D ) . 
LPS in itself did not enhance Plg activation ( not shown ) .

The LPS-binding motif of PgtE is critical for Plg activation and autoprocessing
LPS is important for the folding and assembly of entero-bacterial outer membrane proteins , and the omptins were shown recently to require LPS for biological activity ( Kramer et al. , 2000 ; 2002 ) . 
A consensus LPS-binding motif of four basic amino acids has been identiﬁed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins that bind LPS ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ) . 
Two residues of the motif , Arg-138 and Arg-171 ( PgtE numbering ) , are conserved in correct spatial organization in PgtE , Pla and OmpT to bind phosphorylated glucosamine in lipid A ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ; Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ; Kramer et al. , 2002 ; see Supplementary material , Fig . 
S1 ) . 
We substituted both arginines in PgtE for glutamates separately ( encoded in pMRK32 and pMRK33 ) and together ( pMRK34 ) , and the DpgtE strain SL 1102-1 complemented with these plasmids was tested for Plg activation . 
PgtE R138E and PgtE R171E supported Plg activation , whereas the double mutant PgtE R138E R171E failed to do so ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The omptin molecules in the bacterial outer membrane are partially autoprocessed at a single cleavage site ( Kramer et al. , 2000 ; Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
We next analysed in more detail the processing and folding of PgtE derivatives in the outer membrane ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Folding was

Plasmin activity formed after a reaction time of 6 h is shown . 
Bacterial plasminogen activators and LPS 219 assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis of non-heated omptins ( Heller , 1978 ; Kramer et al. , 2000 ) ; under these conditions , all PgtE derivatives migrated similarly as a single peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 27 000 Da ( 27 kDa ) . 
Heat-denatured PgtE migrated as three distinct peptides , the a-form of 34 kDa , the b-form of 17 kDa and the g-form of 14 kDa . 
The b - and g-forms were not detected in the proteolytically inactive derivative PgtE D206A . 
The PgtE derivatives encoded by pMRK32 and pMRK33 were similarly autoprocessed , whereas the double substitution derivative PgtE R138E R171E did not form the b - or g-forms . 
LPS type affects adhesive and invasive functions of omptins
Pla expresses adhesive and invasive functions that are not dependent on its proteolytic activity or plasmin formation ( Lähteenmäki et al. , 1998 ; 2001a ) . 
To analyse whether these functions are sensitive to LPS type and shared by PgtE , we transformed pMRK1 , pMRK3 as well as pMRK2 , which encodes OmpT of E. coli , into rough ( XL1 , IHE3070 , IHE3074 ) and smooth ( IHE3034 , IHE1049 ) isolates of E. coli and analysed the adhesiveness of the recombinant strains to the basement membrane preparation Matrigel as well as their invasiveness into human ECV304 cells ( Fig. 4 ) , human HUV-EC-C and primary endothelial cells ( not shown ) . 
As with S. enterica and Y. pseudotuberculosis , Plg activation by PgtE and Pla was only observed in rough recombinant E. coli ( Fig. 4 ) , and no major differences in surface expression of the omptins were detected ( not shown ) . 
Pla enhanced adhesiveness and invasiveness of the rough strains to all target cells , whereas the smooth host strains remained poor in both properties . 
PgtE conferred adhesiveness to the rough E. coli strains , and the OmpT-induced adhesion levels were lower than those seen with the other two omptins ( Fig. 4 ) . 
None of the strains exhibited adhesiveness to an albumin-coated surface ( not shown ) , and PgtE and OmpT did not enhance invasion of the host strains into the human cell lines .

Discussion
Each pathogen has adapted to its particular lifestyle , which is reﬂected in the genome organization and expression of virulence factors . 
The genome of Y. pestis contains around 150 pseudogenes , many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
Y. pestis is genetically uniform and estimated to have evolved from the orally infecting intestinal pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis only 1500 -- 20 000 years ago ( Achtman et al. , 1999 ) . 
Y. pestis has rapidly adapted to being a parasite of insects and a blood-borne pathogen of mammals ; outstanding questions in plague pathogenesis have included the high invasiveness of Y. pestis despite possessing an LPS without Oag and the nature of surface structures that complement the loss of the Oag ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
We show here that Pla of Y. pestis and PgtE of S. enterica have a dual interaction with LPS . 
These proteases/adhesins require rough LPS for function but are inhibited by Oag , and we propose that a pathogenic advantage of rough LPS in Y. pestis is to enable efﬁcient Pla-mediated proteolysis , adhesion and invasion to cause systemic disease . 
On the other hand , S. enterica possesses a functional Plg activator which , however , is cryptic in strains with the smooth LPS common in S. enterica isolates . 
S. enterica infects humans by the oral -- faecal route and exploits M cells as the site of entry from the intestine , and a systemic dissemination is considered to occur inside macrophages ( reviewed by Jepson and Clark , 2001 ; Monack et al. , 2001 ) . 
Oag is the major determinant of serum resistance of S. enterica ( Rautemaa and Meri , 1999 ) , whose intracellular lifestyle apparently does not use plasminogen activation by PgtE . 
Reconstitution of Pla indicates that the protein requires rough LPS to be active , and our hypothesis is that rough LPS is important for the activity all omptins . 
Direct evidence for binding of LPS to an omptin remains lacking , but our ﬁnding is in agreement with those from Kramer et al. ( 2002 ) showing that fully acylated lipid A is required for activation of OmpT and that , additionally , the heptosebound phosphates in the inner core of LPS are important for OmpT activation . 
Kramer et al. ( 2002 ) did not speciﬁcally assess the role of 4 cents - phosphate of lipid A in the activation . 
The lack of core phosphates in the Y. pestis LPS ( Vinogradov et al. , 2002 ) and in the Rc/R5 and Re LPSs used in this study highlight the importance of the interactions of Arg-138 and Arg-171 of the omptin mole-cule with the phosphorylated glucosamine in lipid A . 
The 4 cents - phosphate in lipid A in the LPS -- FhuA and the LPS -- OmpT complexes is positioned to make contact with both arginines , which are oriented outside the barrel ( Ferguson et al. , 1998 ; Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ; see Supplementary material , Fig . 
S1 ) . 
The LPS-binding motif of Ferguson et al. ( 2000 ) predicts that R138 of the omptin barrel makes an electrostatic interaction with the 4 cents - phosphate and R171 a hydrogen bond with the O4 atom of the 4 cents - phosphate , and we observed that substitution of both arginines was required to abolish proteolytic activity by PgtE expressed in the Re background . 
The substitution derivative PgtE R138E R171E did not cleave Plg or process itself but was transported normally to the outer membrane . 
The folding of the PgtE derivatives in the outer membrane was assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis of unheated proteins ( Heller , 1978 ; Kramer et al. , 2000 ) , which did not reveal any major changes in protein folding by the substitutions . 
These ﬁndings thus strongly suggest that Arg-138 and Arg-171 speciﬁcally affect the proteolytic activity of PgtE . 
Kramer et al. ( 2002 ) could not detect large structural changes in OmpT upon binding of rough LPS and concluded that LPS is required to obtain a native active site geometry in OmpT . 
Arg-138 and Arg-171 are located in the b-strand leading to loop 3 ( see Supplementary material ) , and we hypothesize that their binding to lipid A phosphate contributes to the formation of the correct conformation of the surface loops . 
This is in accordance with our previous ﬁndings showing that L3 is critical for substrate recognition by Pla ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
Additional amino acids may be involved in omptin -- LPS interactions , as the omptins have counterparts to FhuA residues that interact with phosphate and fatty acids of lipid A ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ; Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ; Kramer et al. , 2002 ) ; the importance of these interactions for omptin function and assembly remain to be established . 
OmpT , in contrast to Pla and PgtE , degrades the small-molecular-mass chromogenic substrate S-2251 ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) , even when expressed in smooth recombinant bacteria . 
Oag inhibited Plg activation and adhesiveness of Pla and PgtE , as well as invasiveness of Pla , but did not prevent the autoprocessing or the cell wall expression of the proteins , and our conclusion is that Oag chains prevent interactions of Pla and PgtE with large-molecular-mass targets through steric hindrance . 
This is supported by the structural model of the b-barrel -- LPS complex ( Ferguson et al. , 1998 ; 2000 ; Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ; Kramer et al. , 2002 ) , which predicts that the Oag is positioned to extend onto the surface loops of omptins . 
It is interesting to note that Oag has been found to interfere with the function of Y. pseudotuberculosis inva-sin expressed in S. ﬂexneri ( Voorhis et al. , 1991 ) . 
Surface expression of PgtE is controlled by the PhoP / Q regulatory system ( Guina et al. , 2000 ) , which also controls the length of the O-antigen ( Guo et al. , 1997 ) . 
The PhoP/Q system responds to intracellular Ca2 + and Mg2 + concentrations . 
Recent DNA array analysis conﬁrmed that pgtE is induced in S. enterica inside macrophages , whereas genes for LPS synthesis and modiﬁcation are repressed ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) . 
This raises the possibility that PgtE can function with large-molecular-mass substrates within macrophages or during bacterial release from dying phagocytes . 
The PmrA/B two-component system regulates modiﬁcation of lipid A phosphates with eth-anolamine and aminoarabinose as well as changes in core polysaccharide structure ( reviewed by Ernst et al. , 2001 ) , and pmrA mutants with increased substitution of 4 cents - phosphate with aminoarabinose ( Helander et al. , 1994 ) support reduced activity of PgtE encoded by pMRK3 ( M. Kukkonen , unpublished ) . 
This is in agreement with the

The omptins are indicated on the left , the bottom panels show activity in host bacteria with pSE380 . 
The strains shown for Plg activation are XL1 ( ﬁlled diamonds ) , 3070 ( ﬁlled triangles ) , 3074 ( ﬁlled inverted triangles ) , 1049 ( open circles ) and 3034 ( open squares ) . 
The symbol open triangle indicates plasmin formation by XL1 with pSE380 . 
The adhesion results are means and standard deviations of adherent bacteria in 20 randomly chosen microscopic ﬁelds of 1.6 ¥ 104 mm2 . 
The invasion is given as the percentage of inoculated bacteria surviving gentamicin treatment . 
Bacterial plasminogen activators and LPS 221 proposed role of the lipid A 4 cents - phosphate for PgtE activity . 
Our ongoing analysis of the effect of PmrA/B regulation on PgtE function , however , indicates several mechanisms as some of the pmrA mutants are deﬁcient in surface expression of PgtE ( M. Kukkonen , unpublished ) . 
The biological signiﬁcance of the autoprocessing of omptins remains open . 
Prevention , by substitution of the cleavage site , has no dramatic effect on proteolytic activities of OmpT or Pla ( Kramer et al. , 2000 ; Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
The mature a-PgtE ( 34 kDa ) is processed into b-PgtE ( 17 kDa ) and g-Pla ( 14 kDa ) , which were not detected with proteolytically inactive derivatives of PgtE . 
The unheated PgtE migrated as a single peptide , which indicates that the cleavage does not destroy the b-barrel structure . 
The precise autoprocessing site in PgtE was not determined in this study , but the sizes of the b - and the gforms and the fact that PgtE R138E and PgtE R171E were autoprocessed suggest that the cleavage site is after Arg-154 . 
This will result in peptides with calculated masses of 17.2 kDa and 15.7 kDa . 
Arg-154 is located in the surface region of the omptin b-barrel , in the vicinity of the catalytic site ( Vandeputte-Rutten et al. , 2001 ) . 
We have shown previously ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ; Lähteenmäki et al. , 2001b ) and also in this communication shown that omptins differ in their functions , and autoprocessing is a further indication of the slightly differing substrate recognition by the omptins : Pla is autoprocessed at the residue Lys-262 in loop 5 ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) and OmpT at Lys-217 in loop 4 ( Kramer et al. , 2000 ) . 
The autoprocessing of Pla and PgtE remains partial , and its biological signiﬁcance , if any , remains to be established . 
Evolution of Y. pestis from Y. pseudotuberculosis O1b has involved the acquisition of the Pla-encoding plasmid pPCP1 ( Brubaker et al. , 1965 , Achtman et al. , 1999 ) . 
When expressed in Y. pseudotuberculosis O1b strains , Pla-mediated Plg activation was efﬁcient only in cells that lacked the O1b antigen , because of either deletion of the chromosomal wb region encoding enzymes active in the synthesis of O1b ( Skurnik et al. , 2000 ) or lack of Oag synthesis at 37 ∞ C . 
The temperature sensitivity of the Oag synthesis may have been crucial for the transformation of the intestinal pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis into the more aggressive and systemic pathogen Y. pestis . 
Infections by Y. pseudotuberculosis are rarely systemic or lethal , but the uncontrolled plasmin proteolysis , bacterial adhesiveness to basement membrane and complement protein degradation caused by Pla are likely to contribute to massive systemic infection by Y. pestis . 
It is important to note that the relative importance of the putative virulence functions of Pla have not been established and that the introduction of pPCP1 into Y. pseudotuberculosis does not decrease the 50 % lethal dose in subcutaneously infected mice ( Kutyrev et al. , 1999 ) . 
This indicates that additional , so far unidentiﬁed factors are also important for the evolution and the high invasiveness of the plague bacterium . 
For example , the rough LPS of Y. pestis has been directly associated with resistance to complementmediated killing ( Porat et al. , 1995 ) . 
Our observation that Pla and PgtE enhance Plg activation and adherence to basement membranes more efﬁciently than OmpT of E. coli supports the hypothesis ( Sodeinde and Goguen , 1989 ) that Pla originates from PgtE of S. enterica . 
Pla and PgtE are 72 % identical in amino acid sequence and , in particular , are similar to each other and differ from the other omptin sequences at sites important in plasminogen recognition ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
An essential difference between Pla and the other two omptins is that only Pla furnishes the pathogen with invasive characteristics . 
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and plasmids
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
For analysis of endogenous PgtE activity , 
Salmonella strains were cultivated in a 3:1 mixture of Nminimal broth ( Nelson and Kennedy , 1971 ) and Luria broth , 2 + supplemented with 8 mM Mg to optimize PgtE expression on the bacterial surface ( Guina et al. , 2000 ) . 
For expression of PgtE , plasmid pMRK3 was constructed by amplifying the complete reading frame of pgtE ( Guina et al. , 2000 ; database accession number AF239770 ) from the genomic DNA of S. enterica SH401 and cloning the fragment into pSE380 under the IPTG ( Promega ) - inducible trc promoter . 
Induction of omp-tin expression by 5 mM IPTG was as detailed in Kukkonen et al. ( 2001 ) . 
The effect of growth temperature on Pla proteo-lysis was tested in Y. pseudotuberculosis Pa3606 ( pMRK1 ) and PB1 ( pMRK1 ) cultivated at either 25 ∞ C or 37 ∞ C under inducing conditions . 
To obtain His6-PgtE , the pgtE gene was cloned into the pQE30 expression vector ( Qiagen ) . 
His6-PgtE was isolated from the cytoplasm of E. coli M15 ( pREP4 ) and His6-Pla from E. coli BL21 ( pREP4 ) under denaturing conditions according to the protocol of the QIAexpressionist kit ( Qiagen ) . 
DNA techniques
Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . 
In frame deletion of pgtE of S. enterica SL1102 and 14028 was performed by site-speciﬁc mutagenesis using the pir-dependent suicide vector pCVD442 ( Donnenberg and Kaper , 1991 ) essentially as described by Mobley et al. ( 1993 ) . 
Primers used in the mutagenesis were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence S. typhimurium LT2 chromosome ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; accession numbers AE008807 and AE008808 ) . 
A DNA fragment covering 3126 bp ( nucleotides 1 -- 2160 in AE008808 and 19142 -- 20107 in AE008807 ) was ampliﬁed from the chromosomal DNA of S. enterica SH401 ( Kukkonen et al. , 1993 ) to contain an in frame deletion of 786 bp ( nucle-otides 115 -- 900 in AE008808 ) within the coding region of pgtE . 
The substitutions D206A , R138E , R171E and the double substitution R138E R171E were created by a recombinant PCR ampliﬁcation procedure ( Higuchi et al. , 1988 ) , in which the desired mutation site was introduced in the internal primer pair , and the outside primer pair was the same as used in amplifying the entire pgtE . 
The correct nucleotide sequence or deletion was ascertained at each mutation site by nucleotide sequencing or PCR ampliﬁcation before testing of the mutated constructs .

Reconstitution of Pla
To remove urea , puriﬁed His - Pla was dialysed 6 extensively against PBS containing 1 mM detergent n-dodecyl-N , N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulphonate ( DodMe2NPrSO3 ) . 
Protein concentration was adjusted to 200 mg ml-1 , and DodMe2NprSO3 was added to the preparation to the ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM . 
LPSs were extracted from S. enterica chemotypes Re and smooth ( Schmidt and Lüderitz , 1969 ) using the phenol -- chloroform -- light petroleum method ( Galanos et al. , 1969 ) and hot phenol -- water ( Westphal and Jann , 1965 ) method respectively . 
To conﬁrm the composition of the LPS , sugar , phosphate and fatty acid analyses were performed as described previously ( Kaca et al. , 1988 ) . 
Puriﬁed Pla ( 1 mg ) was refolded with the LPS preparations ( in a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 10 or 50 mg ml-1 ) or with DodMe2NPrSO3 alone ( Kramer et al. , 2002 ) and tested for Plg activator activity . 
General methods
Analysis of omptin expression in cell envelope preparations was done essentially as described previously ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
Brieﬂy , bacterial cell envelope was released by sonication , and cell debris was removed by centrifugation ; cell envelopes were then pelleted at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4 ∞ C . 
After separation by SDS-gel electrophoresis ( gel density 12 % ) , the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane , and the omptins were detected with rabbit antisera raised against His6-Pla or His6-OmpT ( Kuk-konen et al. , 2001 ) or His6-PgtE produced by Medprobe ( Norway ) as well as secondary antibodies and phosphatase substrate . 
Kinetic measurement of Plg activation with the chromogenic plasmin substrate S-2251 ( Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride ; Chromogenix ) was performed as detailed elsewhere ( Kukkonen et al. , 2001 ) . 
Bacterial adhesion to the basement membrane preparation Matrigel ( Becton Dickinson ) and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; 
Sigma ) was assayed essentially as detailed by Lähteenmäki et al. ( 1998 ) . 
Bacterial invasion into human ECV304 cells ( ATCC 1998-CRL ) , human endothelial HUV-EC-C cells ( ATCC 1730-CRL ) and primary human endothelial cells ( HUVEC ; Technoclone ) was measured by a standard gentamicin protection assay as detailed by Lähteenmäki et al. ( 2001b ) .
