Formation by Environmental Isolates f Salmonella a d t Natural Antimicrobials n Their Sensitivity
I n the United States , nontyphoidal Salmonella alone is responsible for 1 million foodborne illnesses , 19,000 hospitalizations , and 400 deaths each year ( Scallan et al. , 2011 ) . 
Salmonella is frequently associated with outbreaks of human illnesses due to consumption of fresh produce and meat ( Pakalniskiene et al. , 2009 ; CDC , 2010 ; Scallan et al. , 2011 ) . 
Environmental isolates of Salmonella can form bio-ﬁlm on produce and abiotic surfaces as a defensive mechanism to overcome the adverse environmental conditions ( Patel et al. , 2013 ; Yaron and Romling , 2014 ) . 
Bioﬁlm is an organized group of bacterial cells that has ability to attach to biotic or abiotic surfaces ( Costerton et al. , 1999 ) . 
Cell surface hydrophobicity and speciﬁc appendages , including ﬁmbriae , curli , and outer membrane proteins , can inﬂuence bacterial attachment to surface ( Goulter et al. , 2009 ) . 
Studies have shown association of curli expression , cellulose production , and bacterial hydrophobicity for effective attachment and bioﬁlm production by Escherichia coli O157 : H7 and Salmonella enterica on biotic and abiotic surfaces ( Saldaña et al. , 2009 ; Patel et al. , 2011 , 2013 ) . 
Bioﬁlm forming Salmonella may persist for longer duration on food contact surfaces and subsequently cross-contaminate food . 
Furthermore , higher antimicrobial concentrations and effective treatment measures will be required to remove those bioﬁlm forming Salmonella ( Kroupitski et al. , 2009 ; Soni et al. , 2013 ) . 
Ineffective antimicrobial concentrations may lead to development of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella that is even more hazardous from public health and food safety perspective . 
Therefore , it is important to evaluate the efﬁcacy of alternative antimicrobials for removing Salmonella in bioﬁlm . 
Chlorine and other acid-based chemical sanitizers have been used to remove enteric pathogens on food equipment surfaces ( Bodur and Cagri-Mehmetoglu , 2012 ; Wang et al. , 2012 ) . 
Effectiveness of chlorine varies with its chemical and physical state , treatment conditions , and organic residues on fresh produce . 
Furthermore , reaction of chlorine with water containing organic matter results in harmful byproducts such as chloramines and trihalomethanes ( Dychdala , 2001 ; LopezGalvez et al. , 2010 ) . 
Chemical sanitizers such as peracetic acid , chlorhexidine gluconate , benzalkonium chloride , and other quaternary ammonium compounds have been used ; however , 5 -- 7 log reduction of enteric bacteria is difﬁcult with these sanitizers ( Wong et al. , 2010 ; Steenackers et al. , 2012 ; Corcoran et al. , 2014 ) . 
Due to these limitations of sanitizers , advent of antimicrobial resistance of foodborne pathogens , and consumer preference for natural ingredients for their health beneﬁts , there is a need for evaluation of natural antimicrobials as an alternative to chemical sanitizers ( Lee Wong , 1998 ; Condell et al. , 2012 ) . 
Sporran , a proprietary mixture of eugenol , thymol , and rosemary extract and cinnamaldehyde have signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella on spinach , lettuce , and in soil ( Yossa et al. , 2011 , 2012 ; Yossa et al. , 2013 ) . 
Zhang et al. ( 2014 ) reported inhibitory activity of natural antimicrobials against bioﬁlm forming Salmonella in microtiter plate assay . 
In this study , we have used minimum bioﬁlm eradication concentration ( MBEC ) assay to determine the bactericidal efﬁcacy of antimicrobials in kill-ing Salmonella in bioﬁlms . 
The objective of this study was to mitigate the bioﬁlm forming swine environmental isolates of Salmonella by cinnamaldehyde and sporran .

Abstract 
The objective of this study was to determine reduction of Salmonella in bioﬁlms by essential oils . 
Bioﬁlm formation of 15 Salmonella isolates from conventional swine farm environment was evaluated by 96-well microtiter plate crystal violet and minimum bioﬁlm eradication concentration ( MBEC ) assays . 
Only one of the 15 isolates was a strong bioﬁlm producer as classiﬁed by crystal violet assay . 
All Salmonella isolates formed bioﬁlm on MBEC assay . 
The curli expression was robust among strains S322 and S435 ( Salmonella Infantis ) , S644 , S777 , S931 , S953 , and S977 ( Salmonella Typhimurium ) as observed by Congo red dye binding assay . 
The cell hydrophobicity varied with strains and growth phase of the strain ; however , there was no signiﬁcant difference in hydrophobicity of these strains . 
Natural antimicrobials were evaluated with MBEC assay for their bactericidal efﬁcacy in reducing Salmonella in bioﬁlms . 
Cinnamaldehyde and sporran at 1000 ppm signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella in bioﬁlms . 
The bactericidal effect of these antimicrobials increased with their concentrations . 
Salmonella were reduced by 6 log CFU from their initial populations of 7 -- 7.5 log CFU/cm when 2 2000 ppm concentration of these antimicrobials were used . 
Salmonella were undetectable when 3000 ppm of cinnamaldehyde or sporran was used . 
Natural antimicrobials such as cinnamaldehyde and sporran can be used to reduce Salmonella in bioﬁlms .

Materials and Methods
Salmonella strains
Fifteen Salmonella strains : Salmonella Derby ( 2 ) , Salmo-nella Infantis ( 4 ) , and Salmonella Typhimurium ( 9 ) of conventional swine farm environment ( soil and lagoon ) origin were obtained from North Carolina State University ( Table 1 ) . 
These strains were isolated as part of a longitudinal study conducted on 30 conventional farms in North Carolina . 
The details of isolation , antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles , and their phenotypic and genotypic characterizations have been reported previously ( Keelara et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) . 
Bioﬁlm formation, hydrophobicity, and curli expression
Salmonella strains were evaluated for bioﬁlm formation by 96-well microtiter plate crystal violate assay using four growth media : full-strength and diluted ( 10 % ) Luria-Bertani 
( LB ) and Tryptic Soy Broth ( TSB ) as described by Patel and Sharma ( 2010 ) . 
Hydrophobicity assay was determined using bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons ( BATH ) assay as described by Li and McLandsborough ( 1999 ) . 
Percent hydrophobicity was calculated as ratio of the absorbance of the bacterial assays to the control . 
Overnight cultures of individual Salmonella strains grown in TSB were streaked on tryptone agar supplemented with Congo red ( 40 mg/mL ) and Coomassie brilliant blue ( 20 mg / mL ) ( Romling et al. , 2003 ) , and incubated at 22 C and 37 C for 48 h to determine curli expression . 
Curli expressing Sal-monella were identiﬁed by typical red colonies on agar . 
Effect of antimicrobials on Salmonella in bioﬁlms formed on MBEC pegs
A 22 mL of overnight grown culture adjusted to 5.5 log CFU/mL cell density in 10 % LB without salt ( LBNS ) was transferred to the trough of the MBEC plate ( Innovotech , Inc. , Edmonton , Canada ) , and then , the trough plate was covered with the peg lid cover . 
Plates were incubated at 22 C for 48 h on rocking table with the angle of the rocking between 9 and 16 of inclination . 
After incubation , bioﬁlm cells were determined by removing all eight pegs from ﬁrst column of MBEC plate using sterile pliers and immersed in the respective wells of rinse plate containing PBS . 
Rinse plate was sonicated for 15 min in an ultrasonic cleaner ( Branson Ultrasonic Corporation , Danbury , CT ) . 
After sonication , serially diluted aliquots of the bioﬁlm rinsates were spot plated ( 8 spots of 10 lL each ) on XLT4 agar . 
Colonies from each spot were counted following incubation at 37 C for 24 h . 
A 96-well microtiter plate was set as an antimicrobial challenge plate to determine the antimicrobial effect of natural antimicrobials . 
The wells of last column were ﬁlled with 200 lL LB ( control ) and remaining column wells were ﬁlled with 200-lL of 1000 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 , and 5000 ppm concentrations of cinnamaldehyde ( Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , MO ) and sporran ( EcoSmart Tech , Alpharetta , GA ) , or 5 ppm of chlorine ( Clorox , Oakland , CA ) . 
Bioﬁlm pegs with Salmonella population were exposed to the challenge plate containing antimicrobials for 30 min at 22 C . 
After incubation , peg lids were rinsed in a 96-well rinse plate containing 200 lL PBS and then neutralized in a neutralizing agent medium for 2 min . 
After neutralization , Salmonella in bioﬁlm pegs were dislodged by sonication for 15 min in a 96-well microtiter recovery plate containing 200 lL PBS . 
Serially diluted suspensions from wells of each column of recovery plate were spot plated ( 8 spots of 10 lL each ) on XLT4 agar and incubated at 37 C for 24 h to determine surviving Sal-monella populations in antimicrobial-treated bioﬁlm pegs .

Statistical analysis
A split-plot analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) model was used for surviving Salmonella populations in bioﬁlms ( log CFU / cm ) using a negative binomial distribution and logit link 2 function ( SAS 9.4 , Cary , NC ) with whole plot being plate and subplot being well within plate . 
The effects of Salmonella source of origin , Salmonella strains , and their combinations on bioﬁlm formation were analyzed . 
Pairwise means comparisons used the Royen -- Tukey -- Kramer multiplicity adjustment to maintain experimentwise a = 0.05 ( SAS 9.2 , Cary , NC ) . 
Results
Crystal violet bioﬁlm assay
Most Salmonella strains formed bioﬁlms on polystyrene 96-well microplates . 
A cutoff value ( three standard deviations above the mean optical density of the negative controls ) was used for classifying bioﬁlm strength of Salmonella in growth media . 
Salmonella strains were classiﬁed as negative ( 2 ) , weak ( three strains ) , moderate ( eight strains ) , and strong ( one strain ) bioﬁlm producers according to classiﬁcation suggested by Stepanovic et al. ( 2000 ) . 
In general , these Salmonella strains formed stronger bioﬁlms in full-strength LB and TSB media than in corresponding diluted media . 
Biomass produced by eight Salmonella strains grown in fullstrength LB ( 0.13 -- 0.33 ) was signiﬁcantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than in diluted LB ( 0.07 -- 0.20 ) ( Table 2 ) . 
Similarly , seven of 15 Salmonella strains grown in full-strength TSB ( 0.16 -- 0.34 ) produced signiﬁcantly more biomass than in diluted TSB ( 0.11 -- 0.25 ) . 
Bioﬁlm formation varied with the Salmonella serotypes . 
Four of the nine Salmonella Typhimurium strains were either weak on nonbioﬁlm formers . 
All strains of Sal-monella Infantis were moderate bioﬁlm producers , whereas Salmonella Derby strain S657 was the only strong bioﬁlm producer .

Hydrophobicity
Hydrophobicity was characterized by adherence of bacterial cells to hydrocarbons , which contributes to the ability of bacteria to attach to the biotic or abiotic surfaces . 
In this study , 12 out of 15 Salmonella strains were hydrophobic in nature . 
Percent hydrophobicity was diverse among strains and different phases of growth cycle ( Table 3 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in percent hydrophobicity of Salmo-nella strains in their log or stationary growth phase except for strains S421 , S481 , S931 , and S1214 ( Table 3 ) . 
Signiﬁcantly higher hydrophobicity of log-phase cultures was observed with Salmonella strains S421 ( 20.2 % ) and S931 ( 20.1 % ) compared with other Salmonella strains ( Table 3 ) . 
In stationary phase , strain S1214 showed signiﬁcantly higher hydrophobicity ( 20.4 % ) than S1238 ( 7.4 % ) , S948 ( 3.9 % ) , S931 ( 8 % ) , S481 ( 4.2 % ) , and S421 ( 9.1 % ) . 
Curli expression
Salmonella strains were evaluated for their ability to produce curli ﬁmbriae on Congo red agar at two different temperatures ( 22 C and 37 C ) . 
Based on colony characteristics , strains were classiﬁed as negative ( 5 , colorless colonies ) , weak curli producer ( 3 , light pink colonies ) , and strong curli

Antimicrobial activity of cinnamaldehyde and sporran against Salmonella on MBEC bioﬁlm pegs
Salmonella population in bioﬁlm recovered from MBEC pegs ranged from 6.63 to 8.05 log CFU/cm . 
Most Salmo-2 nella strains formed bioﬁlm as evidenced by recovery of signiﬁcantly higher bacterial populations attached to MBEC pegs ( Table 4 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in bioﬁlm formation by Salmonella when compared within source ( soil and lagoon ) and serotype except for Salmonella Typhimur-ium ( S644 ) from soil , which produced signiﬁcant bioﬁlm ( 8.05 -- 0.10 log CFU/cm2 ) among all the isolates . 
Natural antimicrobials were used to remove Salmonella in bioﬁlms formed on MBEC pegs . 
Cinnamaldehyde and sporran signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella populations in bioﬁlm and their antimicrobial effect increased with concentrations . 
Salmonella were undetectable ( < 0.73 log CFU / cm ) when 3000 ppm cinnamaldehyde or sporran were used 2 ( Table 4 ) . 
Cinnamaldehyde and sporran at 2000 ppm reduced ( p < 0.05 ) Salmonella in bioﬁlm by 6 log CFU from their initial bioﬁlm populations of 7 -- 7.5 log CFU/cm . 
The anti-2 microbial effect of cinnamaldehyde varied with strains ; four Salmonella strains ( S481 , S644 , S931 , and S948 ) were undetectable at 2000 ppm concentration of cinnamaldehyde . 
Cinnamaldehyde at lower concentration ( 1000 ppm ) reduced ( p < 0.05 ) all Salmonella strains in bioﬁlms except strains S948 and S977 . 
Likewise , a 1000-ppm sporran signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella strains S644 , S948 , S977 , and S1013 in bioﬁlms . 
Similar to natural antimicrobials , chlorine also signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella by 1 -- 3.43 log CFU/cm at 2 low concentrations ( 5 ppm ) ( Table 4 ) and to undetectable levels at 25 and 50 ppm concentration ( not shown ) . 
Discussion
Bacteria in bioﬁlm environment are resistant to commonly used sanitizers and can contaminate food product . 
Therefore , it is imperative to eradicate bacterial pathogens in bioﬁlms . 
In this study , we evaluated bioﬁlm formation by environmental isolates of Salmonella and subsequent removal of Salmonella in bioﬁlms by cinnamaldehyde and sporran . 
Studies have reported that the farm environment plays an important role in persistence and dissemination of Salmonella all along the food chain ( Keelara et al. , 2013 ; Holvoet et al. , 2014 ) . 
In our study , all Salmonella strains of lagoon origin ( S481 , S948 , S953 , S977 , S1013 , and 1214 ) and three strains from soil origin ( S322 , S421 , and S644 ) formed stronger bioﬁlms ( p < 0.05 ) in full growth media . 
However , it should be noted that these strains were weak or moderate bioﬁlm formers as classiﬁed by Stepanovic et al. ( 2000 ) . 
Our results are in agreement with previous studies where enteric pathogens formed bioﬁlm when under stress or grown in media lacking essential nutrients ( Solomon et al. , 2005 ; Patel et al. , 2011 ) . 
Diluted growth media enhance the expression of promoter agfD , which is involved in Salmonella spp . 
bioﬁlm formation ( Romling et al. , 2000 ; Gerstel and Romling , 2001 ) . 
We observed stronger Salmonella bioﬁlm formation in TSB me-dium than in LB medium . 
Weak bioﬁlm formation in LB medium could be attributed to interference of salt in expression of adhesive extracellular matrix as observed with E. coli ( Romling , 2005 ; Patel et al. , 2011 ) . 
Most Salmonella strains were signiﬁcantly hydrophilic at log phase compared with stationary phase as observed previously ( Patel et al. , 2011 ) . 
The relationship between hydrophobicity and bioﬁlm formation is unclear . 
In the previous study , E. coli O157 : H7 strains 4406 and 4407 were hydro-phobic in nature but formed poor bioﬁlm ( Patel et al. , 2011 ) . 
We observed strong bioﬁlm by MBEC assay by those Sal-monella isolates ( S777 , S953 , and S977 ) , which were hydrophilic in nature . 
Bacterial hydrophobicity had a minimum role in bioﬁlm formation of Shiga-toxigenic E. coli ( Rivas et al. , 2007 ) . 
We suggest that bioﬁlm formation by Salmo-nella in our study may rely on conditions such as nutrient availability , environmental stressors , and effectors for bio-ﬁlm formation ( Reisner et al. , 2006 ) . 
Studies have reported the role of curli expression and relationship with bioﬁlm formation in E. coli and Salmonella ( Barnhart and Chapman , 2006 ; Saldaña et al. , 2009 ; Patel et al. , 2011 , 2013 ) . 
Curli production varied among Salmonella strains , categorized as strong , weak , and curli-negative isolates based on uptake of dye . 
This variation in curli expression has been associated with survival ﬁtness of pathogens as observed in E. coli O157 : H7 ( Carter et al. , 2011 ; Macarisin et al. , 2012 ) . 
In the previous study , a stronger curli expression was reported when environmental isolates of E. coli O157 : H7 were grown at 22 C than at 37 C ( Macarisin et al. , 2012 , 2014 ) . 
However , we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference in curli production by Salmonella isolates at different temperatures . 
In addition , studies have reported both positive ( Boyer et al. , 2007 ; Patel et al. , 2011 ; Yaron and Romling , 2014 ) and negative correlation ( Rivas et al. , 2007 ; Kim and Harrison , 2009 ) with hydrophobic nature of E. coli isolates and bioﬁlm formation . 
Among all Salmonella strains , Salmonella Typhimurium exhibited strong curli production and hydrophobicity , which is alarming as these factors may inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation in Salmonella Typhimurium , one of the most commonly associated serotypes of foodborne outbreaks ( Medalla et al. , 2013 ; Keelara et al. , 2014 ) . 
Removal of Salmonella on equipment surfaces is challenging once it forms bioﬁlm . 
Wong et al. ( 2010 ) evaluated the susceptibility of 3 - and 7-day-old Salmonella bioﬁlm on MBEC plate to chemical sanitizers . 
In their study , the age of Salmonella bioﬁlm did not inﬂuence the efﬁcacy of disinfectants . 
Sodium hypochlorite ( 500 mg/L ) or benzalkonium chloride ( 0.2 % ) could not remove Salmonella bioﬁlms in CDC bioﬁlm reactor ( Corcoran et al. , 2014 ) . 
Chen et al. ( 2015 ) observed the synergistic antimicrobial effect of levulinic acid and SDS in removing up to 7.6 log CFU/mL of Salmonella in bioﬁlms . 
A chlorinated alkaline detergent ( Sanifoam ) was superior to 0.2 % peracetic acid in removing bioﬁlm-forming Salmonella on poultry processing surfaces ( Ziech et al. , 2016 ) . 
Natural antimicrobials such as cinna-maldehyde and sporran have shown antimicrobial activity against various pathogens , including Salmonella and E. coli 
O157 : H7 on biotic and abiotic surfaces ( Jia et al. , 2011 ; Yossa et al. , 2013 ; Zhang et al. , 2014 ; Liu et al. , 2015 ) . 
It is suggested that the mechanism of these antimicrobials is due to more than one mode of action . 
Cinnamaldehyde inhibited amino acid decarboxylase and ATPase in Enterobacter aerogenes and Listeria monocytogenes , respectively ( Thor-oski et al. , 1989 ; Wendakoon and Sakaguchi , 1995 ) . 
Clove oil and thymol present in sporran inhibit amylase and protease activity in Bacillus cereus and increase ATP permeability resulting in lethal damage to bacterial cell ( Gill and Holley , 2006 ) . 
Role of carvacrol at sublethal concentration ( 20 mM ) in disruption of Salmonella bioﬁlm formation has been reported ( Knowles et al. , 2005 ) . 
At lower concentrations , essential oil may interfere with bacterial attachment to equipment surface by reducing ﬂagellar production or by inhibiting quorum sensing ( Nostro et al. , 2007 ; Burt et al. , 2014 ) . 
In preliminary studies , we observed marginal reduction of these pathogens at # 500 ppm concentration of cinnamaldehyde and sporran ( data not shown ) . 
Treatment with thyme oil , oregano oil , or carvacrol at 0.025 % reduced up to 1.6 log Salmonella in bioﬁlms after a 1-h exposure ( Soni et al. , 2013 ) . 
They observed complete removal of Salmonella in bioﬁlms at 0.05 -- 0.1 % concentrations of these antimicrobials . 
In our study , cinnamaldehyde and sporran at 3000 ppm concentration reduced Salmonella in bioﬁlms to undetectable level ( < 6 log reduction ) . 
Cinnamaldehyde and sporran at # 1000 ppm has signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella on fresh produce ( Yossa et al. , 2012 , 2013 ) . 
Four Salmonella Typhi-murium strains were undetectable at lower concentrations ( 2000 ppm ) of cinnamaldehyde suggesting differences in sensitivity of these isolates to cinnamaldehyde . 
In this study , the need for higher concentrations of these antimicrobials for complete removal of Salmonella in bioﬁlms could be attrib-uted to environmental ﬁtness of Salmonella strains . 
Chlorine is used at different concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 ppm in commercial processing facilities as a chemical sanitizer to reduce microbial load on fresh produce ( Cherry , 1999 ; Taormina and Beuchat , 1999 ) . 
In our study , chlorine signiﬁcantly reduced Salmonella in bioﬁlm at 25 and 50 ppm concentrations . 
Conclusions
Our study conﬁrms that environmental isolates of Salmo-nella form bioﬁlm under unfavorable conditions , which could facilitate their persistence and dissemination in the farm environment and food chain . 
Natural antimicrobials such as cinnamaldehyde and sporran are effective in reducing Salmonella in bioﬁlms . 
These natural antimicrobials at higher concentrations can serve as an alternative to chemical sanitizers toward meeting consumers ' preference for natural interventions in the food system . 
Furthermore , natural anti-microbials could overcome the potential concern of chlorinetolerant bacteria in water . 
This study provides evidence for the role of natural antimicrobials in removing bioﬁlms and potential concerns to the overall cost -- beneﬁt analysis when compared with chlorine .
