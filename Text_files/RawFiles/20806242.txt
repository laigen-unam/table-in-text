SEF14 fimbriae are only found in some strains of serogroup-D Salmonella such as S. enteritidis , suggesting that SEF14 fimbriae may affect serovar-specific virulence traits . 
In this study , we found that prevalence of sefA , sefD and sefR genes in S. dublin and S. enteritidis was 100 % . 
In 18 isolates of S. pullorum , the prevalence of sefA gene was 100 % , while the prevalence of sefD and sefR genes was 38.9 % ( 7/18 ) , and 11 strains isolated after 1980s did not contain any gene sefD or sefR . 
Interestingly , among the 7 strains of S. pullorum before 1980s , the sefD sequence has a missing base pair at position 196 and caused open reading frame ( ORF ) shift , resulting in a stop codon ( TAG ) at position 71 amino acid residual ( Leu of TTA at position 214 -- 216 shift into stop codon of TAG at position 215 -- 217 ) . 
Unlike S. pullorum , all S. enteritidis and S. dublin tested could express SEF14 fimbriae in vitro .

Introduction*
The existence of fimbrial structures on the surface of Salmonella enterica serovar , such as the plasmid-enco-ded fimbriae ( PEF ) , long polar fimbriae ( LPF ) , thin aggregative fimbriae ( AGF ) and type I fimbriae ( FIM ) , has been recognized for many years [ 1 -- 4 ] . 
Originally , Feutrier et al. [ 5 ] detected a fimbriae from a human isolate of S. enteritidis , and biochemically characterized the fimbriae polypeptide subunit ( Mr , 14,400 ) , which was markedly lower than that reported for the type 1 fimbriae of S. typhimurium ( Mr , 22,100 ) [ 5 ] . 
Ogunniyi et al. [ 6 ] reported that SEF14 fimbriae could illicit a strong , protective immune response , in the following study , some data shown that SEF14 fimbriae were not involved in primary attachment to murine or human-originated intestinal epithelia [ 7 , 8 ] . 
Further results demonstrated that the SEF14 fimbriae were essential for full virulence of S. enteritidis in vivo , and that the SEF14 fimbriae mediated interactions between the bacteria and host

The role of SEF14 fimbriae in virulence remains to be further elucidated . 
The sef14 fimbriae operon contains four structure genes ( sefABCD ) which required for the translocation and biogenesis of SEF14 fimbriae [ 9 ] , both SEFA and SEFD are located on the cell surface and may play an important role in interaction between bacteria and host cells . 
sefA encodes the major subunit , sefD encodes the putative adhesin . 
And adjacent to sefD , there is an AraC-like regulatory protein encoded by sefR that activates transcription of the sef genes [ 10 ] . 
The gene sefA has been shown to have limited distribution among Salmo-nella serogroup-D and some species such as S. pullorum , S. gallinarum , and S. typhi possess the intact gene of sefA but fail to express SEF14 fimbriae [ 11 ] . 
In this study we focus on sefA , sefD and sefR of sef14 operon gene clusters of S. pullorum and S. enteritidis and investigate clues of different expression of SEF14 fimbriae between S. pullorum and S. enteritidis . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture
A total of 18 strains of S. pullorum , 11 strains of S. enteritidis and one strain of S. dublin were used in this study . 
Standard procedures were used to prepare the bacteria . 
Colonisation factor antigen ( CFA ) broth ( casomino acid 10 g/l , yeast extract 1.5 g/l , MgSO4 · 7 H2O 0.05 g/l , MnCl2 0.005 g/l , pH 6.0 ) was prepared for SEF14 fimbriae expression [ 12 ] . 
S. pullorum isolates isolated in different times of years in the infected chickens were listed in Table 1 , kindly provided by Yangzhou-based Poultry Institute , Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences , and of all 18 strains , 7 were isolated before 1980s . 
The S. enteritidis clinical isolates SE20 , SE43 , SE51 , and SE57 from human gastroenteritis outbreaks were kindly provided by the Center for Disease Control of Yangzhou . 
The isolates MY , XJ were isolated from infected ducks ( gifts from Dr. Cheng , College of Animal Science and Technology at Sichuan Agriculture University ) and S. O9 isolate from the diseased chicken . 
The S. enteritidis standard strains 50336 , 994 , 3378 and 50041 were generous gifts from Dr. Schifferli , school of Veterinary Medicine at University of Pennsylvania and S. dublin ( C79 -- 84 ) was purchased from China Institute of Veterinary Drugs Control . 
PCR, DAN cloning and sequencing analysis
The bacterial genomic DNA as PCR templates were extracted according to previous methods [ 13 ] . 
The presence of sefA , sefD and sefR gene of SEF14 fimbriae were detected by PCR amplification and each pair of oligonucleotide primers were used in the following : sefA F : CGC ATA TGG CTG GCT TGT TGG TAA C , sefA R : CGA CTA GTT TAG TTT TGA TAC TGC TGA A ; sefD F : GAA TCA GTA TAA TTC GTC AAT ACC TAA G , sefD R : ATT CAA TTT CTG TCG CAT ATA TGC TTA T and sefR F : ATG TTG AAA AAA AAC GCC ATA A , sefR R : AGC ATA AAT GCA GCT TTT TCT C , respectively , which were designed according the reported sequence information [ 10 , 14 ] . 
PCR products were subjected to horizontal gel electro-phoresis in 1.5 % ( w/v ) agarose , and the size of PCR products were determined based on DL2000 marker ( Takara biotechnology ) . 
All PCR products with expected size of molecular weight were purified and cloned into pMD18-T easy vector ( Takara biotechnology ) for sequencing by commercial service ( Takara biotechnology and service ) and analysis with the help of biosoftware DNASTAR ( Dnastar ) . 
Isolation and identification of SEF14 fimbriae
The gene sefA was cloned into plasmid pET22b + ( Novagen ) and constructed recombinant plasmid , pETsefA . 
After pETsefA was transformed to host cells E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and 0.1 mM IPTG induce for optimal condition , the recombinant BL21 ( DE3 ) with pETsefA expressed the soluble fusion protein of SEFA protein and polyhis-tidine-tag ( rSEFA-his ) with approximate size of 15.2 kDa which were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and Westernblotting analysis with mouse anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody ( Invitrogen ) . 
The fusion protein was purified by Protino Ni-TED 2000 packed columns according the purification manual ( Macherey-Nagel ) . 
The mouse sera with high titer of anti-rSEFA were made after being immunized with the purified rSEFA-his protein . 
SEF14 fimbriae were extracted according the reported methods with some modification [ 15 ] . 
Briefly , bacteria were grown statically in 200 ml of CFA medium at 37 °C for 50 h , harvested by centrifugation , and pellets were suspended in 10 ml of 0.15 Methanolamine buffer ( pH 10.5 ) . 
Fimbriae were separated from the cells at room temperature by shearing bacteria in a blender for three minutes , after which cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation ( 12,000 × g , 15 min , and 4 °C ) . 
The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) containing 0.2 % SDS to precipitate fimbriae SEF 14 . 
These proteins were resolved by 12 % SDS-PAGE , Western-blotting was conducted as described and the mouse anti-rSEFA serum was used as the first antibody , horse-radish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG ( Sigma ) for the secondary antibody [ 16 ] .

Result and discussion
Based on molecular weight and DNA sequence the pre-valence of sefA , sefD and sefR genes in S. dublin and S. ente-ritidis was 100 % . 
In S. pullorum sefA gene was detected in all 18 isolates of S. pullorum , while sefD and sefR genes were only detected in 7 S. pullorum strains those isolated before 1980s . 
The prevalence of sefD and sefR was 7/18 ( 38.9 % ) on S. pullorum strains ( Table1 ) . 
The sequence of sefA , sefD and sefR genes in S. enteritidis were identical with those sequences in NCBI GenBank data which accession number were L11008 , U07129 and AF233854 , respectively . 
The sequence of sefA gene from 18 isolates of S. pullorum was completely identical to sefA gene from S. enteritidis . 
Most interestingly , 7 isolates of S. pullorum containing sefD gene has a missing base pair at position 196 which caused ORF shift , resulting in a stop codon ( TAG ) at position 71 amino acid residual ( Leu for TTA at position 214 -- 216 shift into stop codon for TAG at position 215 -- 217 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Edwards et al. [ 9 ] suggested SEF14 fimbrial subunits from the periplasm of bacteria were exported across the cytoplasmic membrane in a secretory-dependent manner . 
Using a genetic approach with well defined , isog-enic mutants of ΔsefA strain and ΔsefD strain , expression of SEF14 fimbriae in different mutants showed that export of SEFD occurred in the absence of sefA gene ( ΔsefA strain ) and export of SEFA did not occur in the absence of sefD gene ( ΔsefDstrain ) [ 9 ] . 
They proposed that sefD encoded the adhesin subunit of SEF14 fimbriae and the translocation of sefD is a prerequisite for the export of sefA across the outer membrane [ 9 ] . 
In this report , although 18 isolates of S. pullorum contain the intact sefA gene , but no SEF14 protein expression was detected . 
The missing base pair at position 196 in sefD gene , or absence of sefD gene in all 18 isolates may be the reason that they did not express SEF14 fimbriae . 
In the following study , through SEF14 fimbriation culture , fimbriae extraction , isolation and identification , the fimbriae expression in different Salmonella strains was tested . 
Based on SDS-PAGE analysis , there were 14.3 KD protein bands of major subunit SEFA in lane1 and lane3 for all strains from S. enteritidis and S. dublin , respectively , but not in lane2 for S. pullorum ( Fig. 2A ) . 
And the result of Western-blotting further confirmed that the kind of protein extracted from S. enteritidis and S. dublin could be recognized by anti-rSEFA serum , there was no band showed in lane2 for S. pullorum ( Fig. 2B ) . 
This illustrated that we extracted SEF14 fimbriae from S. enteritidis and S. dublin successfully , and S. enteritidis and S. dublin could express SEF14 fimbriae in the surface of bacteria , but not S. pullorum . 
This result was identical with the prevalence of sef genes and their sequencing in S. pullorum . 
Very interestingly , in this study we found that the isolated S. pullorum strains before 1980s all contain defective sefD and sefR genes , and those strains isolated after 1980s just contained sefA gene , but no sefD and sefR gene . 
Based on the data of the difference and variation of sef14 operon gene clusters between S. enteritidis and S. pullorum , we may explain why SEF14 fimbriae in S. pullorum could not be expressed . 
By now we are not sure the role of SEF14 fimbriae as a virulence factor and the significance of the SEF14 antigen existed in some strains of Salmonella . 
And this kind of mutant isolates or mutants of sef gene unable to express SEF14 fimbriae may help to answer some of these questions .
