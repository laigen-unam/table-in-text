QseC is a membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase found in Gram-negative pathogens and is involved in the regulation of bacterial virulence . 
LED209 , a QseC-specific inhibitor , significantly inhibits the virulence of several pathogens and partially protects infected mice from death by blocking QseC . 
However , the mechanism of its antibacterial effects remains unclear . 
In this experiment , a Salmonella Typhimurium ( S.Typhimurium ) and macrophage co-culture system was utilized to investigate possible mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial effects of the QseC inhibitor . 
QseC blockade inhibited the expression of QseC-dependent virulence genes , including flhDC , sifA , and sopB , in S.Typhimurium , leading to inhibition of swimming motility , invasion capacity , and replication capacity of the pathogens . 
Release of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) from S.Typhimurium-infected macrophages was significantly inhibited by blocking QseC . 
Activated caspase-1 and IL-1β levels were suppressed , and intracellular bacterial count was reduced in infected macrophages . 
QseC blockade effectively reduced the virulence of S.Typhimurium , inhibited S.Typhimurium-induced pyroptosis of macrophages , and promoted elimination of intracellular bacteria from infected macrophages . 
Thus , the antibacterial effects of QseC inhibitor are mediated via enhancement of intracellular killing of S.Typhimurium in macrophages . 
The rapid and global distribution of antimicrobial-resistant organisms is one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe infections and has become a significant challenge to humans1 ,2 . 
Certain types of Gram-negative bacteria have become resistant to all available antibiotic drugs , contributing to increased morbidity and mortality , diffifficulty in controlling infectious illness , and escalating healthcare costs3 ,4 . 
On the other hand , discovery and development of new antibiotics has rapidly declined , and the number of new antibiotics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration has decreased in recent years . 
Consequently , the arsenal of antibiotics is shrinking , weakening our ability to treat infectious diseases5 ,6 . 
Therefore , developing new antibiotic agents with low probabilities of inducing resistance is of paramount importance . 
Anti-quorum sensing is a promising theoretical strategy to prevent bacterial infections because this type of targeting may reduce resistance selection . 
Many Gram-negative bacteria carry QseC , a highly conserved membrane histidine sensor kinase , to identify environmental cues and regulate the expression of virulence factors . 
Upon sensing both host-derived adrenergic signals and the bacterial aromatic signal autoinducer-3 , QseC autophosphorylates and subsequently phosphorylates a transcription factor , namely , QseB , which activates the transcription of key virulence genes7 .

( email : xxluo3@fmmu.edu.cn ) inhibits QseC-mediated activation of virulence-related gene expression and partially protects mice from death following infection with Salmonella typhimurium or Francisella tularensis8 . 
However , LED209 only inhibits bacterial virulence and does not suppress S. Typhimurium growth . 
The fundamental mechanism underlying the in vivo protective effects of LED209 remains unclear . 
The macrophage inflammasome , a critical component of the innate immune response , is a large multiprotein complex that recognizes invading pathogens in the cytosol and enables autocatalytic activation of caspase-1 . 
Activation of this protein triggers maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 as well as pyroptosis , a pro-inflammatory form of macrophage cell death9 ,10 . 
Previous studies reported that the macrophage NLRC4 inflammasome can detect S. Typhimurium flagellin . 
Moreover , caspase-1-induced pyroptosis of macrophages is an innate immune response to fight intracellular bacteria11 . 
However , excessive cell pyroptosis can cause immunological diseases and septic shock in the host12 ,13 . 
We hypothesized that QseC inhibitors may suppress inflammasome over-activation and macrophage pyroptosis by inhibiting bacterial virulence release and enhancing the clearance of S. Typhimurium . 
In this experiment , we investigated the possible antimicrobial mechanisms of Br-LED209 , a LED209-derived QseC inhibitor , with a co-culture system of S. Typhimurium and macrophages . 
Br-LED209 effectively blocked the QseC of S. Typhimurium and suppressed the expression of its virulence genes . 
After that , QseC blockade inhibited S. Typhimurium-induced pyroptosis of macrophages and promoted the elimination of intracellular bacteria , which were possibly mediated by inhibiting excessive activation of inflammasomes in the infected macrophages . 
Materials and Methods Bacterial strains . 
S. Typhimurium ( XJ76218 ) , enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 : H7 ( EHEC ) ( XJ76330 ) , and Shigella flexneri ( XJ76116 ) were obtained from Xijing Affiffiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University ( Xi'an , China ) . 
All of these strains were isolated from feces of patients . 
Synthesis and characterization of Br-LED209 . 
Ara-acetylaminobenzene sulfonyl chloride and para-bromoaniline were used as raw materials to obtain 4-amino-N - ( 4-bromophenyl ) benzenesulfonamide through acylation and deacylation . 
The resulting product and phenyl isothiocyanate were then used to yield N - ( 4-bromophenyl ) -4 - ( 3-phenyl thiourea ) benzenesulfonamide , named Br-LED209 in short . 
The synthesis route and chemical structure of Br-LED209 is shown in Figure S1 . 
The chemical structure of Br-LED209 was confirmed by mass spectrometry ( MS ) , 1H NMR , and 13C NMR ( data not shown ) . 
Br-LED209 is a light yellow powder with melting point between 116 °C and 120 °C . 
The purity of Br-LED209 is higher than 95 % . 
Br-LED209 was dissolved in DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in all of the in vitro experiments was 1 % ( v/v ) . 
DMSO at the same concentration was used as control in all the experiments . 
Construction of the qseC mutant strain . 
An isogenic S. Typhimurium qseC mutant was constructed using λ red mutagenesis as described previously8 . 
Briefly , a qseC PCR product was generated using prim-ers showed in Table 1 and pKD3 as template , and gel-purified . 
The PCR product was electroporated into S. Typhimurium containing pKD46 , which were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour , and plated on media containing 30 μg / ml chloramphenicol overnight at 37 °C . 
The resultant colonies were patched for chloramphenicol resist-ance and ampicillin sensitivity , and PCR verified for the absence of the gene . 
Plasmid pCP20 , which encodes a resolvase , was electroporated into the mutant strain , and the resulting colonies were patched for chloramphenicol sensitivity . 
The chloramphenicol cassette was resolved from the mutant and a non-polar isogenic qseC mutant was created . 
Bacterial susceptibility and growth assay . 
To analyze bacterial growth , one isolated single colony was inoculated into 2 ml of Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth and cultured at 37 °C with shaking overnight . 
The overnight culture was diluted to 1:100 in 4 ml of fresh LB broth and then cultured at 37 °C . 
Br-LED209 was added to bacterial cultures to obtain final concentrations of 10 , 50 , and 200 μM . 
Bacterial cultures were collected for cell growth analysis by measuring OD600 absorbance every 1 h , and growth curves were generated according to the values of OD600 absorbance . 
The minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) were determined by a microdilution assay with broth microdilution guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute . 
Levofloxacin ( LEV ) was used as the positive antibiotic control .

Protective effects of Br-LED209 on S. Typhimurium-infected mice . 
Eight - to ten-week-old male BALB/c mice weighing 18 -- 22 g were used in this study . 
Infection was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 1.0 × 108 colony-forming units ( CFUs ) of wild-type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant in 0.4 ml of LB broth . 
The mice were treated orally with 20 mg/kg Br-LED209 three hours before and after infection . 
Livers and spleens were harvested at 8 , 16 and 24hours after infection . 
The samples were homogenized , and the supernatants were plated on agar plates for evaluating bacterial burden in the infected organs . 
The morphologies of livers and spleens of infected mice were examined by observing hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the respective tissues . 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR . 
To evaluate the QseC blocking effifficiency of Br-LED209 , the expression of virulence genes in WT S. Typhimurium and the qseC mutant was detected by quantitative real-time PCR . 
In brief , RNA was extracted from an overnight culture grown aerobically in LB medium in the absence or presence of 200 μM Br-LED209 using a bacterial RNA isolation kit ( Tiangen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
The primers used in the real-time assays are listed in Table 2 . 
Real-time RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex TaqII ( Takara ) following the manufacturer 's instruction . 
The rpoA ( RNA polymerase subunit A ) gene was used as the endogenous control . 
Data was collected using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager 2.1 software . 
Data were normalized to levels of rpoA and analyzed by the comparative critical threshold ( CT ) method . 
Expression levels in different groups were compared by the relative quantification method . 
Real-time data are expressed below as fold changes compared with the WT group in the absence of Br-LED209 . 
Motility assay . 
To evaluate the effect of Br-LED209 on the flagella motility of S. Typhimurium , S. Typhimurium ( WT and qseC mutant ) was cultured in LB medium for 12 h. Subsequently , 1 μl aliquot of the culture was spotted onto 0.3 % agar plates with or without 200 μM Br-LED209 , and halo sizes were measured at 6 , 12 and 18 hours after incubation at 37 °C 14 . 
HeLa cell invasion and intracellular bacteria replication assay . 
HeLa cells were plated in 96-well culture dishes at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well and infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 50:1 for 1 h . 
The cells were then treated with 100 μg / ml gentamicin for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria . 
The cell culture medium was replaced with 10μg / ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment . 
The cells were then lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 at the indicated time points , and the lysates were diluted and plated on agar plates to determine the number of CFUs14 . 
Fold increase was calculated as the ratio of intracellular bacteria at 6 and 12 hours to that at 1 hour . 
Macrophage release lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assay . 
Male BALB/c mice weighing 18 -- 22 g were sacrificed by cervical dislocation . 
Resident peritoneal macrophages were harvested as described previously with slight modification15 . 
In brief , the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 5 ml of ice-cold sterile PBS . 
The buffer containing resident peritoneal cells was slowly withdrawn . 
Cells were collected by centrifugation ( 1000 × g for 5 min ) and plated in a culture flask containing Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium ( Hyclone ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U/ml penicillin , and 100 μg / ml streptomycin . 
The peritoneal macrophages were allowed to adhere for 3 h ( 37 °C , 5 % CO2 ) and then washed with PBS to remove unattached cells . 
The macrophages were plated in 96-well culture dishes ( Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well . 
Experiments were performed as described previously with slight modifications16 -- 18 . 
Briefly , S. Typhimurium were grown overnight in LB at 37 °C . 
The overnight culture was subsequently diluted at 1:50 into fresh LB and grown for 3 -- 4 h at 37 °C before infection . 
Macrophages were infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant diluted in fresh DEME at MOI of 25:1 . 
Images of macrophages were taken under a light microscope at 1 h after infection . 
LDH released in the supernatant was detected using a cytotoxicity detection kit ( Roche ) . 
Data on detected LDH were used to calculate the pyroptotic rate of infected macrophages based on the following equation : [ ( experimental release − spontaneous release ) / ( maximum release − spontaneous release ) ] × 100 , where spontaneous release is from the cytoplasm of uninfected macrophages , and maximum release is that obtained by lysis of macrophages with a solution of 0.1 % Triton X-100 .

For the fluorescence microscope assay , macrophages seeded on a glass slide were infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at MOI of 25:1 for 1 h and washed twice with PBS . 
The macrophages were stained with DAPI and the membrane impermeant dye propidium iodide ( PI ) . 
The percentage of PI-positive cells was determined by counting cell numbers in four random visual fields . 
Western blot . 
The caspase-1 p10 subunit and processed interleukin ( IL ) -1 β released into the culture supernatant from macrophages were collected and precipitated with 10 % TCA ( vol/vol ) for 1 h on ice .

The macrophages were infected with opsonized WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at MOI of 25:1 for 30 min . 
Then the cells were washed with PBS and treated with 100 μg / ml gentamicin for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria . 
The cell culture medium was replaced with 10 μg / ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment . 
To count the number of intracellular bacteria , macrophages were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 for 10 min .

Results
Bacterial growth was not inhibited by Br-LED209 in vitro . 
To assess whether Br-LED209 influences the growth of bacteria in vitro , S. Typhimurium , S. flexneri , and EHEC were cultured in LB medium in the absence or presence of Br-LED209 at different concentrations . 
The growth curve demonstrated that Br-LED209 did not inhibit growth of the three strains in vitro at concentrations up to 200 μM . 
Meanwhile , levofloxacin , which was used as a positive control , completely inhibited the growth of all three tested strains at two fold dilutions of MIC values used on each strain ( Fig. 1A -- C ) . 
The results of MIC assay showed that Br-LED209 did not have significant bactericidal effects at a concentration of 256 μg / ml in vitro ( Fig. 1D ) . 
Figure 1 . 
Br-LED209 has no influence on bacterial growth in vitro . 
Growth curves of Salmonella Typhimurium ( A ) Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) ( B ) Shigella flexneri ( C ) were drawn every hour at OD600 absorbance in the absence or presence of Br-LED209 at different concentrations . 
The antibiotic levofloxacin ( LEV ) was used as positive control . 
( D ) Minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of Br-LED209 . 
S. Typhimurium-infected mice were protected in vivo by blocking QseC . 
To evaluate the protective effects of Br-LED209 in vivo , BALB/c mice were infected by intraperitoneal administration of WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at 1.0 × 108 CFUs . 
The mice were treated twice orally with Br-LED209 ( 20 mg / kg ) at 3 h before and after infection . 
Livers and spleens were harvested at 8 , 16 and 24 hours after infection , homogenized and then plated on agar plates for bacterial counts . 
The results showed that bacterial numbers in the liver and spleen were dramatically lower in Br-LED209-treated mice and qseC mutant-infected mice than the corresponding values in WT-infected mice ( Fig. 2A , B ) . 
Livers and spleens were harvested at 24 hours after infection and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . 
The morphological structure of liver tissue samples exhibited obvious hepatocyte edema and vacuolar degeneration in the WT-infected group . 
Besides , the WT-infected group showed significant congestion in hepatic sinusoid and central vein . 
No obvious hepatocyte edema , vacuolar degeneration and congestion were observed in the Br-LED209-treated and the qseC mutant-infected groups ( Fig. 2C ) . 
In spleen tissue , splenic corpuscles demolished and disappeared , red pulp widened and white pulp atrophied in the WT-infected group . 
Meanwhile , obvious congestion was observed in the red pulp and white pulp area of the WT-infected group . 
However , hyperemia of red pulp and white pulp was drastically reduced in the Br-LED209-treated group and the qseC mutant-infected group ( Fig. 2C ) . 
Swimming motility of S.Typhimurium was inhibited by blocking QseC . 
Flagella-mediated motility is fundamental to S. Typhimurium pathogenesis . 
For this reason , expression of the flhDC gene , which encodes the master regulator of flagellum biosynthesis , was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR . 
Data were normalized to levels of rpoA and were calculated as fold changes compared to the WT group . 
The results showed that flhDC expression in S. Typhimurium was dramatically decreased in the presence of Br-LED209 at 200 μM and also the qseC mutant compared with the WT strain ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Next , a motility assay was performed to examine whether swimming motility of S. Typhimurium was affected . 
The diameter of motility halos was significantly reduced in the presence of Br-LED209 at 200 μM and also in the qseC mutant compared with the WT strain ( Fig. 3B , C ) . 
Figure 2 . 
Bacterial burden and pathological damages in organs of infected mice were reduced by blocking QseC . 
( A , B ) BALB/c mice were infected by intraperitoneal administration of 1.0 × 108 CFUs of WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant . 
The mice were treated twice orally with Br-LED209 ( 20 mg/kg ) at 3 h before and after infection . 
Livers and spleens were harvested at 8 , 16 and 24 hours after infection , homogenized and then plated on agar plates for bacterial counts . 
( * P < 0.05 , ** P < 0.01 , *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in two-way ANOVA , n = 5 ) ( C ) Morphological characteristics of liver and spleen in BALB/c mice were compared among groups infected with WT S. Typhimurium , the qseC mutant or Br-LED209 . 
Scale bars : 100 μm . 
These motility experiments were performed in triplicate , and the halo diameters reflect the average of these experiments . 
These results suggested that motility inhibition of S. Typhimurium was related to QseC blockade . 
Figure 3 . 
The swimming motility of S. Typhimurium was inhibited by blocking QseC . 
( A ) Expression of the mobility-related gene flhDC was evaluated . 
RNA was extracted from an overnight culture grown aerobically in LB medium in the absence or presence of Br-LED209 . 
Real-time reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR was performed . 
The rpoA gene was used as the endogenous control . 
Data were normalized to levels of rpoA and were calculated as fold changes compared to the WT group . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in one-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) ( B , C ) Swimming motility assay . 
About 1 μl of WT bacteria or the qseC mutant was spotted onto agar plates with or without 200 μM Br-LED209 , and halo sizes were measured at 6 , 12 and 18 hours after incubation at 37 °C . 
( * P < 0.05 , *** P < 0.001 vs. WT ; # P < 0.05 vs. WT+B r-LED209 in two-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) . 
The invasion and replication capacities of S. Typhimurium were inhibited by blocking QseC . 
To evaluate the invasion and replication capacity of S. Typhimurium , the expression of invasion - and replication-associated genes sopB and sifA in S. Typhimurium were measured by quantitative real-time PCR . 
Data were normalized to levels of rpoA and calculated as fold changes compared with the WT group . 
The results showed that QseC blockade inhibited the expression of sopB and sifA in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 4A , B ) . 
To further investigate the down-regulation of invasion-associated genes in response to QseC blockade , the invasion capacity and replication capacity of S. Typhimurium on epithelial cells were investigated . 
HeLa cells were infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at the MOI of 50:1 for 1 , 6 , or 12 h . 
The cells were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 , and the lysates were diluted and plated on agar plates to determine the CFU . 
Fold-increase was calculated as a ratio of the intracellular bacteria count at 6 and 12 hours to that at 1 hour . 
The results demonstrated that QseC blockade significantly decreased the numbers of intracellular bacteria at each time point ( Fig. 4C , D ) , suggesting that the invasion and replication capacities of S. Typhimurium were inhibited by blocking QseC . 
Inflammasome activation and pyroptosis of infected macrophages was inhibited by blocking 
QseC . 
Br-LED209 did not kill S. Typhimurium in vitro ( Fig. 1 ) , but eliminated them from the internal organs of infected mice ( Fig. 2 ) . 
We hypothesized that the clearance of bacteria from infected mice by Br-LED209 might be mediated by antimicrobial innate immune response . 
Macrophages play crucial role in controlling S. Typhimurium infection . 
Therefore , we investigated whether the function of macrophages was affected by S. Typhimurium infection . 
Overnight culture of S. Typhimurium were diluted at 1:50 into fresh LB and grown for 3 -- 4 h at 37 °C before the infection . 
Macrophages were infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at MOI of 25:1 . 
Images of macrophages were taken under a light microscope at 1 h after infection . 
The images showed that a high percentage of macrophages infected with S. Typhimurium were swollen , and many of the infected cells had died at 1 h after infection . 
In the Br-LED209-treated group and the qseC mutant-infected group , macrophages were protected and no significant cell death was observed ( Fig. 5A ) . 
LDH released in the supernatant was detected 1 h after infection using a cytotoxicity detection kit . 
Results showed that the amount of released LDH decreased significantly after 
Figure 4 . 
The invasion and replication capacities of S. Typhimurium were inhibited by blocking QseC . 
( A , B ) Expression of the invasion - and replication-related genes sopB and sifA was evaluated in S. Typhimurium . 
RNA was extracted from an overnight culture grown aerobically in LB medium in the absence or presence of Br-LED209 , and RT-PCR was performed . 
The rpoA gene was used as the endogenous control . 
Data were normalized to levels of rpoA and were calculated as fold changes compared to the WT group . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in one-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) ( C ) HeLa cells were infected with S. Typhimurium for 1 h . 
The cells were treated with 100 μg / ml gentamicin for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria . 
Then the cells were lysed and bacteria were diluted and plated on LB medium plates to determine the number of CFU . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in one-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) ( D ) After treatment with 100 μg / ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria , the cell culture medium was replaced with 10 μg / ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment . 
Cells were lysed at the indicated time points and intracellular bacteria were counted . 
Fold-increase was calculated as the ratio of intracellular bacterial count at 6 and 12 hours to that 1 hour . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in two-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) . 
Figure 5 . 
Inflammasome activation and pyroptosis of infected macrophages was inhibited by blocking QseC . 
( A ) S. Typhimurium were grown overnight in LB and subsequently diluted at 1:50 into fresh LB and grown for 3-4 h at 37 °C . 
Macrophages were infected with WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant diluted in fresh DEME at MOI of 25:1 . 
Morphological characteristics of macrophages after S. Typhimurium infection . 
Light microscope images were taken at 1 hour post-infection . 
Scale bars : 20 μm . 
( B ) LDH released from S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages was measured . 
The pyroptotic rate of macrophages was calculated based on the equation in methods . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in one-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) ( C , D ) Membrane permeability of macrophages after S. Typhimurium infection . 
Macrophages were stained with DAPI and the membrane impermeant dye propidium iodide ( PI ) . 
Scale bars : 20 μm . 
The percentage of PI-positive cells was determined by counting cell numbers in four random visual fields . 
( *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in one-way ANOVA ) ( E ) Macrophages were infected with S. Typhimurium . 
Activated caspase-1 and IL-1β were precipitated from macrophage supernatants and detected by Western blot . 
QseC blockade ( Fig. 5B ) . 
To further confirm these results , we stained the infected macrophages with DAPI and PI and calculated the percentage of PI-positive cells by counting cell numbers in four random visual fields . 
We detected strong PI signals in S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages . 
QseC blockade significantly reduced the number of PI-positive cells ( Fig. 5C , D ) . 
The inflammasome can recognize invading pathogens , activate caspase-1 and subsequently trigger inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis . 
To further confirm the manner of death of infected macrophages , the expression of activated caspase-1 and IL-1β were detected by Western blot . 
Data showed that QseC blockade significantly suppressed the production of the caspase-1 p10 and IL-1β p17 forms of macrophages ( Fig. 5E ) , which indicated that inflammasome activation had been significantly inhibited and macrophage pyroptosis had been prevented . 
Elimination of intracellular bacteria from macrophages was enhanced by blocking QseC . 
Next , the capacity of the macrophages to kill bacteria was evaluated . 
Since inflammasome-activating S. Typhimurium induced rapid macrophage pyroptosis within 1 hour of infection ( Fig. 5 ) , intracellular bacterial burden could not be measured under this condition . 
Thus , another condition was used to study macrophage-killing capacity according to many previously published studies19 -- 21 . 
S. Typhimurium were cultured overnight and opsonized in DMEM containing 10 % normal mouse serum for 20 min before infection . 
The numbers of intracellular vital bacteria were counted at 1 , 8 , and 16 hours after infection . 
The data showed no difference in the number of recovered bacteria among the different treatment groups at one hour after infection . 
However , the number of bacteria recovered from macrophages significantly decreased after Br-LED209 treatment or infection with qseC mutant bacteria at 8 and 16 hours after infection ( Fig. 6 ) . 
The results indicated that QseC blockade could promote the clearance of intracellular Salmonella by inhibiting intracellular replication of bacteria and increasing the killing capacity of macrophages . 
Discussion
QseC is a promising target for developing broad-spectrum antimicrobials because of its broad distribution and high degree of conservation among different bacterial species22 . 
LED209 is a potent QseC inhibitor that blocks the expression of virulence genes and suppresses the pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria8 ,22 . 
Thus , LED209 is a promising antimicrobial agent . 
However , LED209 only exerts protective effects against S. Typhimurium infection in a mouse model and does not affect bacterial growth in vitro . 
The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear . 
In this study , Br-LED209 , which is a LED209 derivative , was synthesized to explore the mechanism of its protective effects in vivo . 
The effifficacy of Br-LED209 at inhibiting QseC was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo . 
Results showed that Br-LED209 did not kill S. Typhimurium in vitro ( Fig. 1 ) . 
However , bacterial burden in the liver and spleen of infected mice was reduced significantly and pathological damage of these infected organs was alleviated after Br-ED209 treatment in vivo ( Fig. 2 ) . 
These results indicated that Br-LED209 retained its ability to block QseC . 
QseC regulates multiple virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium . 
As such , downstream genes regulated by QseC would be affected if the protective effects of Br-LED209 were mediated by blocking QseC . 
The flhDC gene encodes the master regulator of flagellum biosynthesis in S. Typhimurium , and regulates bacterial motility and facilitates bacterial invasion23 . 
The sopB gene encoding SopB participates in the invasion of nonphagocytic cells , early maturation of Salmonella-containing vacuole ( SCV ) , regulation of SCV traffifficking , and inhibition of SCV -- lysosome fusion24 ,25 . 
The sifA gene is required for SCV membrane integrity and 
Figure 6 . 
Elimination of intracellular bacteria from macrophages was enhanced by blocking QseC . 
S. Typhimurium were cultured at 37 °C with shaking overnight and opsonized in DMEM and 10 % normal mouse serum for 20 min . 
Macrophages were infected with opsonized WT S. Typhimurium or the qseC mutant at MOI of 25:1 for 30 min . 
The cells were washed with PBS and treated with 100 μg / ml gentamicin for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria . 
Then , cell culture medium was replaced with 10 μg / ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment . 
To count the number of intracellular bacteria , macrophages were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 . 
Bacteria were diluted and plated on LB medium plates to calculate CFU at the indicated time points . 
( * P < 0.05 , ** P < 0.01 , *** P < 0.001 vs. WT in two-way ANOVA , n = 3 ) . 
SCV maintenance . 
This gene permits the survival and replication of S. Typhimurium in macrophages and inhibits lysosome function20 ,26 . 
All of these three genes are tightly regulated by QseC and are particularly important in S. Typhimurium pathogenesis . 
Therefore , the expression and virulence of these genes were investigated . 
Results indicated that QseC blockade significantly inhibited the expression of QseC-regulated virulence genes including flhDC , sifA , and sopB in S. Typhimurium . 
Moreover , QseC blockade suppressed flagellar motility as well as the invasion and replication capacities of S. Typhimurium in epithelial cells ( Figs 3 and 4 ) . 
Macrophages are key innate immune cells that play a critical role in controlling bacterial infection . 
Inflammasome signaling of macrophages and caspase-1-induced pyroptotic cell death are innate immune effector mechanisms against many bacterial species11 ,27 -- 30 . 
Pyroptosis removes the replication niche of intracellular bacteria and promotes bacterial clearance through the NADPH oxidase system of recruited neutrophils11 . 
Previous studies have reported that caspase-1 activation clears pathogens such as Salmonella28 , Shigella29 , and Legionella30 , and controls infection . 
However , systemic or excessive activation of inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis in vivo may be deleterious to bacterial clearance12 ,13 . 
For example , Shigella infection activated NLR inflammasomes , promoted mac-rophage cell death , and secured its own dissemination31 . 
In a murine model of acute pneumonia , pyroptosis of alveolar macrophage by inflammasome signaling induction impaired Pseudomonas aeruginosa clearance and increased mortality . 
Conversely , restricting inflammasome activation enhanced bacterial clearance and decreased pathology32 . 
NLRC4 inflammasome-induced pyroptotic signaling have been reported to cause enhanced vascular permeability , septic shock , and rapid death in mice after the cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin33 . 
Ayres et al. found that inflammasome activation in a mouse model of Escherichia coli resulted in IL-1β -- driven lethal immunopathology , which could not be tolerated by the host34 . 
Inhibiting inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis by caspase-1 specific inhibitors or caspase-1 and NLRC4 knockout also significantly alleviated tissue damage , decreased bacterial burden , and increased the survival rate of infected mice32 -- 35 . 
Many studies have proposed that pyroptosis may benefit the host during infection but may be detrimental during overwhelming infection or sepsis12 ,13 . 
At the early onset of infection , bacteria hide in macrophages and replicate themselves until bacterial load is suffifficient to subvert immune defense . 
Under such condition , pyroptosis is beneficial to the host because bacteria will be released from macrophages and subsequently killed by neutro-phils . 
However , during overwhelming infection , inflammasome-induced pyroptosis releases a large number of pathogens from macrophages for dissemination throughout the host . 
The recruited neutrophils will fail to kill all bacteria and effectively control infection . 
Therefore , repeated rounds of pyroptosis can lead to severe inflammatory changes and significant damage to host tissues36 . 
Low bacterial quantities or localized infections induce inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis , and positively promote bacterial clearance11 ,28 -- 30 . 
High bacterial quantities or severe sepsis cause lethal inflammasome activation and pyroptosis31 ,32,34,37,38 . 
In the present study , we performed intraperitoneal injection of 108 CFUs of S. Typhimurium into mice . 
Such a high bacterial load could lead to severe and overwhelming sepsis-like infection . 
QseC blockade significantly suppressed flagellar gene expression in S. Typhimurium and subsequently inhibited caspase-1 activation , IL-1β release , and macrophage pyroptosis ( Fig. 5 ) , promoted the antimicrobial activity of macrophages to eliminate intracellular bacteria ( Fig. 6 ) , and alleviated inflammatory damage of infected tissues ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The defensive function of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis as well as the role of IL-1β in the clearance of microbial infections are controversial . 
Pyroptosis is a caspase-1-dependent form of programmed cell death . 
Caspase-1 has a critical function in the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and in triggering inflammatory response39 . 
IL-1β may induce the upregulation of adhesion molecules in the endothelium to mediate neutrophil recruitment and clear bacteria40 . 
However , IL-1β is one of the major proinflammatory cytokines in sepsis41 ,42 . 
While a low amount of these cytokines is critical for cell-mediated bacterial killing , excessive production of cytokines can lead to severe immunopathology43 ,44 . 
In summary , over-activation of inflammasomes can induce excessive macrophage pyroptosis and severe tissue damage . 
Our results demonstrated that QseC blockade significantly inhibited the pyroptosis of infected mac-rophages and improved the clearance of S. Typhimurium from infected macrophages .
