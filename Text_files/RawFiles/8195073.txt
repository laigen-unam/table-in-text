Coproporphyrinogen oxidation is a late step in heme biosynthesis . 
The biochemically characterized eukaryotic coproporphyrinogen III oxidases have an obligate requirement for molecular oxygen , and a similar enzyme is encoded by the hemF gene in Salmonella typhimurium . 
Anaerobic heme synthesis requires an oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen oxidase , which is probably encoded by the hemN gene in S. typhimurium . 
The hemN gene has been cloned from an insertion mutant . 
The nucleotide sequence was obtained and used for PCR amplification of the wild-type gene . 
A single open reading frame was identified as the hemN gene on the basis of its interruption by the insertion mutation and plasmid complementation studies of hemF hemN double mutants . 
The predicted HemN protein has 38 % amino acid sequence identity to a putative anaerobic Rhodobacter sphaeroides coproporphyrinogen oxidase . 
The hemN RNA 5 ' end and the inferred transcription initiation site were mapped by primer extension . 
The 52.8-kDa HemN protein is expressed from the second ATG codon of the hemN open reading frame . 
An open reading frame with an unknown function directly upstream of hemN has a striking amino acid sequence , including 11 acidic residues in a row . 
Heme (Fe protoporphyrin IX) and various modified deriv- atives are cofactors for a number of important enzymes. In enteric bacteria such as Salmonella typhimunum and Esche- richia coli, heme is essential for the activity of the cytochromes in respiratory chains, which function in electron transport to oxygen or nitrate. Heme is therefore required for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (1, 22). Heme is also the cofactor for two catalases, encoded by katG and katE, which are important in cellular defense against oxygen metabolites (7, 9). The heme biosynthetic pathway branches at uroporphy- rinogen III to produce two additional compounds, siroheme and cobalamin (vitamin B12) (24, 31, 37). Heme synthesis occurs in 10 steps starting from glutamate. Coproporphyrinogen oxidation, the eighth step in the pathway, converts the propionyl groups on the A and B rings of coproporphyrinogen III into vinyl groups. The reaction is an oxidative decarboxylation and requires an electron acceptor (11). All eukaryotic coproporphyrinogen oxidases have an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen to serve as the acceptor (5, 38, 47). In prokaryotes, both anaerobic respiration and synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll (by photosynthetic organ- isms) require an oxygen-independent coproprophyrinogen ox- idase (28, 42, 43). Rhodobacter sphaeroides, for example, is known to have both types of activity (40). We have previously described genetic evidence for the existence of both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen oxidases in S. typhimurium (44). The presence of two enzymes, which might be redundant under aerobic conditions, would explain the failure to generate coproporphyrinogen-accumulating hem mutants of S. typhi- murium in a single step. We predicted that mutants defective in the oxygen-independent enzyme should require heme for anaerobic respiration. Auxotrophs that are Hem- only during
anaerobic growth were isolated and mapped to the hemN gene near 85 min . 
Starting from a hemN mutant strain , secondary mutations which affect the oxygen-dependent enzyme were found ; these map in the hemF gene near 50 min ( 44 ) . 
Since no other loci were found in these mutant hunts , we suggested that hemF encodes the oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen oxidase , while hemN encodes the oxygen-independent enzyme . 
The functional redundancy of hemF and hemN for aerobic growth suggests that the hemN product can function in either the presence or absence of oxygen . 
Subsequent results have confirmed that hemF does encode an oxygen-dependent cop-roporphyrinogen oxidase similar to the yeast enzyme ( 5 , 45 , 48 ) . 
Knowledge about the oxygen-independent enzyme is very limited compared with its aerobic counterpart . 
The first description of an anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity , provided by Tait ( 42 , 43 ) 20 years ago , was followed by a few other reports ( 28 , 40 ) . 
The enzymatic activity is complex : it apparently requires both membrane and soluble components , NADP + , S-adenosylmethionine , and perhaps a flavoprotein as cofactors ( 42 , 43 ) . 
Here , we report the cloning and sequencing of the S. typhimurium hemN gene . 
We have identified a single open reading frame ( ORF ) that is responsible for complementation of all hemN mutants . 
The sequence predicted for the HemN protein is very similar to a predicted anaerobic coproporphy-rinogen oxidase from R. sphaeroides ( 10 ) .

diography were all performed exactly as descr * ibed previously ( 15 ) . 
Primer extension . 
RNA for primer extensioin was prepared from S. typhimunum TE4950 , which is TE22Z 31 carrying the plasmid pTE483 . 
The primer ( 5 ' - CCAGA T ( - nCCA GTCwA TllGC T-3 ' ) hybridizes within the hemN gene and was extended 112 nucleotides to the RNA 5 ' end , an A at bp 1419 . 
RNA preparation , 32P 5 ' - end labeling of ti ie primer , and reverse transcription were done as described previously ( 45 ) . 
Conversion ofhemN : : Mud-J to hemN : : Mud - ( Cam . 
The MudCam element was originally constructed on a pllasmid and then transferred to the S. typhimurium chromosomie to give strain TE2730 ( put : : Mud-Cam ) as described elsewlhere ( 16 ) . 
This strain was used as the donor in a phage P22-imediated transduction into the recipient strain TE4559 ( hemP V : : Mud-J Aput ) , which contains the hemN704 : : Mud-J insertion and a nontransducible deletion in the put region ( derived from MS1748 [ Table 11 ) . 
The desired recombinant with the he?mN : : Mud-Cam insertion was obtained by selecting for Camr arid screening for Kans and Lac - . 
Sequence of the zif-214 : : TnlO insertion site . 
TE3954 ( hemN704 : : Mud-J zif-214 : : TnlO ) contains two linked transposon insertions . 
A 1.2-kb DNA fragment was otbtained by PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA with prinners ( MuR and TnlO ) derived from the transposon sequentces ( 16 ) . 
After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI , a 0.7-kb fragment , which extends from a BamHI site in the TnlO prime-r to the EcoRI site within the hemN gene , was cloned into pUC120 . 
The pUC reverse primer ( New England Biolabs ) was us ; ed to sequence into the 0.7-kb fragment from the BamHI sidle . 
The junction sequence of the TnlO and chromosomal DN / K indicated that TnlO had been inserted into the ( duplicatesd ) 9-bp target sequence ( 5 ' - TGCGCAGCC-3 ' ) between bp I1442 and 1450 . 
Construction of a mutation ( ATG - > AC ( G ) affecting the hemN initiation codon . 
The mutation that cha : nges the second ATG ( Met ) codon of the hemN gene at bp 1521 to an ACG ( Thr ) codon was constructed by PCR with pTE482 as the template . 
The method took advantage of a Soiu3A site in the hemN gene that lies 21 bp downstream of tthe target ATG codon . 
One primer was used to introduce thte mutation ; this primer also created a novel BamHI site at the position of the Sau3A site ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In a second PCR , an adjjoining segment was amplified with a primer that created a nc wvel BglII site at the Sau3A site . 
The primers were designecd so that upon ligation of the two PCR fragments to join the iamHI and BglII sites , the Sau3A site at bp 1545 was regenerateed , restoring the wild-type sequence of the hemN gene except ifor the ATG-to-ACG mutation ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The two cloned PCR fragments were made as follows . 
One fragment extended from a Clal site ( derived frrom the pBR322 
ClaI site and next to the HindlIl site at bp 1240 ) to the novel BamHI site and included the changed ATG codon ; the fragment was amplified with the pBR322 RI cw primer ( 5 ' - GTATC ACGAG GCCCT TTCGT-3 ' ) , which was extended across the pBR322 EcoRI , ClaI , and HindIII sites , together with a second primer ( 5 ' - CGGGA TCCCA GTCTA 1TI GC TGTTC AGAC-i TGCTC ACTCC TTC-3 ' , bp 1548 to 1509 ) introducing the ATG-to-ACG mutation ( mutation underlined ) and the novel BamHI site . 
The second PCR fragment started from a novel BglII site introduced by a primer ( 5 ' - GAAGA TCTGG CCCTG ATCCA GAAAT-3 ' ) , which hybridized to bp 1545 to 1566 , and was extended to the HindIll site at bp 2180 in the middle of hemN . 
A three-fragment ligation was used to join the two PCR fragments at their BamHI and BglII sites , inserting them into pTE482 cleaved at the ClaI and HindlIl ( bp 2180 ) sites . 
The new plasmid , pTE485 , is identical to pTE482 except that it carries the ATG-to-ACG mutation . 
This mutation has been confirmed to be the only mutation in pTE485 , by sequencing the PCR-derived part of pTE485 .

The nucleotide sequence for the hemN gene has been given GenBank accession number U06779 .

RESULTS
Cloning and DNA sequence of the hemN gene . 
Heme is an essential cofactor for cytochromes , which are required for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources . 
Mutants defective in a number of hem genes have been recovered by screening for strains that require exogenous heme for aerobic growth on glycerol or NB agar ( 44 ) . 
The eighth step in the heme pathway , oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III , requires either the hemF or the hemN function during aerobic growth ( 44 ) ; only double mutants defective in both genes have a Hem - phenotype aerobically . 
The hemF gene encodes an oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( 45 ) . 
Under anaerobic conditions , the hemN function is specifically required for this step ; thus , the hemN gene probably encodes an oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen oxidase . 
The hemF gene was cloned previously by complementation of a hemF hemN double mutant by using a library of S. typhimurium chromosomal DNA fragments inserted in pBR328 ( 20 , 45 ) . 
No hemN clones were recovered by this method . 
Therefore , the hemN gene was cloned as a Mud-Cam insertion . 
Mud-Cam is a small derivative of phage Mu that is suitable for mutagenesis and cloning ( 16 ) . 
Strain TE4571 was constructed by converting the hemN704 : : Mud-J insertion into hemN704 : : Mud-Cam , as described in Materials and Methods . 
Genomic DNA prepared from strain TE4571 was digested with SalI and then cloned into pBR322 , selecting for Camr . 
The resulting plasmid , pTE467 , contains a SalI fragment from the hemN region including the hemN : : Mud-Cam insertion ( Fig. 2 ) , and the SalI hemN fragment ( except the insertion ) was sequenced as described in Materials and Methods . 
Primers were designed to PCR amplify the 0.8-kb HindIII-SalI fragment by using genomic DNA of the wild-type strain LT-2 as the template . 
The cloned 0.8-kb HindIII-SalI PCR fragment was sequenced to show that no mutations had been introduced by PCR . 
Then , this HindIII-SalI fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pTE467 , which carries the hemN : : Mud-Cam insertion . 
The new plasmid , pTE483 , contains a wild-type version of the hemN gene . 
The sequence o the entire 3,055-bp Sall fragment carrying hemN is shown Fig. 3 . 
hemN An sequence . 
open reading frame , interrupted Mud-Cam insertion in pTE467 , was identified as the gene . 
This ORF starts at bp 1521 and is predicted to encode 52.8-kDa protein of 457 amino acids . 
Although the would allow a longer potential ORF of 485 amino starting from upstream ATG an codon at bp 1437 , we that hemN starts from the downstream ATG . 
This is pated partly because a good Shine-Dalgano sequence rectly positioned near the downstream ATG . 
Expression from the downstream ATG is also suggested the HemN + phenotype of a strain with the zif-214 : : TnlO insertion ( originally from strain SK811 ) ( Table 1 ) insertion lies between the two ATG codons ( bp 1442 and would interfere with translation from the upstream In this strain , transcription of hemN probably depends TnlO promoter ( 8 ) . 
To confirm that the HemN protein is translated starting the downstream ATG , we constructed a mutation that ATG codon into ACG ( Thr ) , as described in and Methods and illustrated in Fig. 1 . 
This mutation expression of the HemN protein from the plasmid pTE458 below ) . 
Complementation tests . 
The identification of the hemN was also supported by complementation tests . 
A hemN hemE double mutants was isolated by localized tagenesis with hydroxylamine as described in Materials Methods . 
The mutant strains failed to form visible during aerobic growth on minimal glycerol agar but when heme was added to the medium . 
Recombination-defi-cient recA versions of all 12 mutants could be complemented for heme-independent growth by the plasmidpTE482 only hemN + . 
For each mutant , the results of complementation tests with plasmids carrying DNA segments from region were the same for the hemN : : Mud-J plasmid pTE458 , containing the ATG ( Met ) - to-ACG mutation , was incapable of complementing the hemN double mutants . 
These results strongly suggest that genes close to hemN are not required for heme

Sequence similarity to genes from other organisms . 
Recently , the DNA sequence of the E. ccli region corresponding to the S. typhimurium hemN gene has been determined as part of a large study ( 34 ) . 
An ORF corresponding to HemN is also found in E. coli . 
The predicted sequences of the E. ccli and S. typhimurium HemN proteins are very similar : only 34 changes of 455 amino acids ( two residues have not been determined in the published E. coli sequence ) . 
The sequence of an R. sphaeroides gene encoding an anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase has also been reported previously ( 10 ) . 
The amino acid sequence deduced for the R. sphaeroides coproporphy-rinogen III oxidase ( 305 amino acids ) has significant similarity to the C-terminal two-thirds of HemN . 
Furthermore , the R sphaeroides protein sequence can be extended further to an upstream ATG . 
When this is done , similarity to HemN continues over the entire protein sequence ( Fig. 4 ) . 
DNA sequences from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Rhizobium phaseoli that encode predicted proteins with extensive similarity to HemN were also found in searches of the Genbank data base ( 46 ) . 
The significance of the similarity seen with these sequences ( which are both unpublished ) is not clear because in both cases the amino acid sequence similarity is distributed over more than one ORF . 
Further studies are needed to determine the explanation for these results . 
Upstream of hemN lies another ORF ( orf-171 ) predicted to encode a 171-amino-acid protein . 
The amino acid composition of this ORF is striking . 
It contains more than 40 % charged residues , with particularly high charge density in both the N-and C-terminal domains , including 11 contiguous acidic resi-dues near the C terminus . 
Charge clusters of this kind are very unusual in prokaxyotic proteins ( 27 ) . 
So far , we do not know anything about the function of this ORF . 
Genetic map of the hemN region . 
Nucleotide sequence homology helped to locate the hemN region on the E. coli chromosome . 
A map based on the E. coli sequence is shown in Fig. 5 ( 25 , 26 , 33 , 34 ) . 
The hemN gene lies about 2 kb downstream ofpolU and is next to the glnALG operon ; hemN and glnALG are convergently transcribed . 
This map is consistent with our previous placement of the hemN gene at 85 min in the S. typhimunium chromosome ( 44 ) . 
Primer extension . 
The position of the hemN promoter was determined by primer extension ( Fig. 6 ) . 
RNA purified from an S. typhimurium strain carrying pTE482 was used as the template for reverse transcription . 
The 5 ' - end and inferred transcription initiation site maps 102 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon . 
Sequences that have correct spacing to be conserved hexamers of a ( u70 promoter are also indicated in Fig. 3 . 
Identification of a protein encoded by the hemN gene . 
The maxicell technique was used to examine proteins expressed from plasmids carrying hemN , as shown in Fig. 7 . 
The plasmid pTE482 contains a HindIII-SalI fragment with a wild-type copy of hemN ( Fig. 2 ) . 
A labeled protein of about 50 kDa was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , consistent with the predicted size of HemN . 
The plasmids pTE485 and pTE486 are derivatives of pTE482 that carry mutations in the hemN gene . 
pTE485 contains the ATG ( Met ) - to-ACG ( Thr ) mutation described above , and pTE486 carries a frameshift mutation constructed by filling in the HindIII site in the middle of the hemN gene . 
Neither of these two plasmids expressed the 50-kDa protein . 
primer extension products . 
The position of the band corresponding to the hemN transcript is indicated by an arrow . 
The two lanes on the right show the same reaction but with different volumes loaded onto the gel . 
The sequencing ladder GATC was generated with the same primer that was used for primer extension . 
The sequence given is the complement of nucleotides 1424 to 1403 of Fig. 3 . 
S. typhimurium DNA carried in pTE483 is indicated by The hemN gene and an upstream ORF ( orf-171 ) lie fragment and are transcribed left to right .

The upstream ORF extends from bp 817 to 1329 , and hemN extends from bp 1521 to 2891 . 
The hemN gene starts from the second ATG condon of a longer ORF . 
Underlined letters indicate the transcriptional initiation site and a possible o70 promoter sequence .

DISCUSSION
In this the hemN work we have characterized gene of S. typhimurium , the which is required for oxygen-independent oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III for heme synthesis . 
No other found to genes have been be required for this reaction . 
mutations recovered All previously by screening for this phenotype were mapped at the hemN locus ( 44 ) , and only hemN the one hem gene was identified in the region from DNA sequence and complementation tests reported in this hemN gene was by cloning fragments of chromosomal DNA from a hemN : : Mud-Cam insertion mutant , the drug selecting resistance for encoded by the transposon . 
used to Subsequently , PCR was generate a plasmid carrying DNA and complementhe wild-type hemN gene . 
sequencing tation studies established the position of hemN within the cloned segment . 
A protein of about 50 kDa was observed in maxicells , consistent with the predicted size for HemN of 52.8 kDa . 
The predicted amino acid sequence of the HemN protein is 38 % identical to that of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase encoded by the R sphaeroides hemF gene ( 10 ) . 
Given the similarity to the R. sphaeroides gene , we believe that hemN is likely to be the structural gene for this enzyme in S. typhimunium . 
In a previous study of the aerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase encoded by hemF ( 45 ) , we detected oxygen-dependent conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX by extracts of S. typhimurium . 
The activity was absent in a hemF mutant and substantially increased when hemF was provided on a multicopy plasmid . 
In contrast , so far we have been unable to demonstrate activity of the oxygen-indepen-dent system , even in extracts prepared from cells carrying hemN on a multicopy plasmid . 
At present we do not know the reason for this , but on the basis of our experiments with the HemF enzyme , we are confident that we could have detected activity if our extracts had contained a functional enzyme . 
We can not predict whether the S. typhimurium HemN activity should be oxygen sensitive , but we have assumed that it may be , even though the enzyme clearly functions under aerobic conditions in vivo ( 44 ) . 
In our experiments , we tried to duplicate the conditions used in Tait 's work with the photosynthetic bacterium R. sphaeroides ( 42 , 43 ) . 
A similar activity has been in reported Rhizobium japonicum ( 28 ) . 
Assays were performed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of Mg2 + , with NADP + and either S-adenosylmethionine or a combination of ATP and methionine as cofactors . 
For the other coproporphyrinogen oxidases , the requirement for S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor in a reaction which does not involve methylation indicates that the reaction is unusual . 
We think that there may be a parallel to other enzymes ( pyruvate formate-lyase , lysine 2,3-amino mutase , and the class III ribonucleotide reductase ) for which S-adenosyl-methionine acts to generate a stable protein radical ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 13 , 14 , 19 , 29 , 30 ) . 
A similarity to class III ribonucleotide reductase would be particularly striking since the class I ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes an oxygen-dependent reduction which utilizes a tyrosyl radical ( reviewed in reference 35 ) . 
Tyrosines have been implicated in the action of the oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen oxidase from bovine liver ( 47 ) . 
Comparison with other S-adenosylmethionine-de-pendent enzymes may help in further studies of coproporphy-rinogen oxidase .
