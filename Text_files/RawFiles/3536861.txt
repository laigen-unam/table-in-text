The proU locus , which encodes a high-affinity betaine transport system , and the kdp operon , which encodes a potassium transport system , are the principal osmoresponsive genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium . 
The kdp operon is known to be induced in response to changes in cell turgor . 
We have investigated the control of proU expression and shown that it differs from that of kdp in a number of fundamental ways . 
Rather than responding to changes in turgor , proU expression is principally determined by the intracellular accumulation of potassium ions . 
Potassium and betaine were shown to play distinct osmoprotective roles . 
Potassium serves as the principal osmoprotectant and is accumulated in response to low-level osmotic stress to restore turgor . 
As external osmolarity is increased to a level at which the corresponding increase in internal potassium concentrations is potentially deleterious to enzyme function , betaine ( when available ) is accumulated in preference to potassium . 
The different mechanisms ofproU and kdp regulation reflect the different physiological roles of these two osmoprotectants . 
Bacterial cells are frequently subjected to fluctuations in
the osmolarity of the medium in which they are growing . 
Most organisms respond to osmotic stress in a similar manner , by accumulating high intracellular concentrations of compatible solutes ( 30 , 31 ) . 
These solutes not only balance external osmolytes such that cell turgor is maintained but must also be compatible with the function of intracellular enzymes . 
In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium the accumulation of K + ions plays a primary role in maintaining the osmotic balance of the cell ( 6 ; W. Epstein , FEMS Microbiol . 
Lett. , in press ) . 
An ionic balance is normally maintained by the intracellular synthesis of equivalent amounts of glutamate ( 41 ) . 
Potassium uptake is mediated by two independent transport systems , a low-affinity system , Trk , and a high-affinity system , Kdp ( 36 ) . 
The Kdp system contributes to the accumulation of K + whenever the Trk system is not sufficiently active to maintain turgor ; the expression of the kdp operon is specifically induced under such conditions ( 26 ) . 
It is well established that in the absence of exogenous solutes such as proline or betaine the intracellular concentration of K + ions is essentially proportional to the osmolarity of the external medium ( 16 ) . 
However , in complex media the situation is less simple . 
Certain organic compounds ( compatible solutes ) can serve as osmoprotectants and , if accumulated by the cell , will significantly enhance growth universally rates at high osmolarity . 
The most adopted compatible solutes are proline and betaine ( N,N,N-trimethylglycine ) . 
Betaine is accumulated during osmotic stress by such diverse organisms as halotolerant plant spe-cies ( 44 ) , marine animals ( 4 ) , halophilic bacteria ( 22 ) , and cyanobacteria ( 35 ) . 
Both proline and betaine can serve as osmoprotectants for the gram-negative bacteria E. coli and S. typhimurium . 
Thus , increased synthesis of proline ( 13 ) or betaine ( 27 , 40 ) or the uptake of these compounds when supplied exogenously ( 6 , 7 , 11 , 14 , 29 , 34 ) can markedly enhance growth rates at high osmolarity . 
There are two distinct transport systems for betaine in S. typhimurium ( 6 , 7 ) . 
The proP gene encodes a low-affinity betaine uptake system which also transports proline ( 6 ) , whereas the proU gene , originally defined as a proline transport system ( 14 , 15 ) , encodes a high-affinity transport system with betaine as its principal substrate ( 7 ) . 
ProU is a periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport system ( unpublished results ) , and expression of the proU gene is induced under conditions of osmotic stress ( 7 , 15 , 17 ) . 
The proP and proU genes have also been identified in E. coli and probably serve analogous roles ( 17 , 18 ) . 
Osmotic stress affects the expression of only a very limited number of bacterial genes ( 7 , 12 ) . 
The relative expression of the porins OmpC and OmpF is affected by the osmolarity of the medium ( 19 , 20 ) . 
However , many other factors also influence porin expression ( 42 ) , and the precise role of osmolarity is obscure and may be indirect . 
Expression ofphoA and malB is also affected by medium osmolarity ( 43 ) , but again these affects are not major and may well be an indirect effect on the cellular concentration of their relevant inducers ( 5 ) . 
In E. coli the enzymes involved in the conversion of choline to betaine are only synthesized in osmotically stressed cells ( 40 ) . 
The genes encoding these enzymes are located near the lac operon and are absent in S. typhimurium and many E. coli strains ( 40 ) . 
It seems that their likely regulation is at the level of transcription , but this has not yet been demonstrated . 
Unlike of the any above-mentioned , osmotically influenced genes , kdp and proU are fully repressed at low osmolarity , and expression is induced over 100-fold by osmotic stress . 
Thus , kdp and proU are the only two known genes which are directly induced at the transcriptional level in response to osmotic stress . 
The kdp and proU genes encode high-affinity potassium and betaine transport systems , respectively . 
The relative roles of K + and betaine in restoring turgor and facilitating growth at high osmolarity are presently obscure . 
In this paper we show that these two osmoprotectants play distinct physiological roles . 
It has been demonstrated that the kdp gene is primarily regulated in response to changes in turgor pressure ( 26 ) . 
Initial studies showed that , like kdp expression , proU expression is also induced by osmotic stress ( 7 , 15 , 17 ) . 
We show here that there are a number of fundamental differences in the responses of kdp and proU to osmotic stress . 
These differences are reconciled by the demonstration that induction of proU expression is not directly controlled by changes in cell turgor , but is apparently dependent upon the intracellular concentration of potassium ions . 
Thus , when a cell is osmotically stressed the consequent changes in cell turgor activate K + transport , leading to an increase in intracellular K + concentrations which induces proU expression . 
The different mechanisms of induction of pro Uand kdp are shown to reflect distinct physiological roles for betaine and potassium as osmoprotectants . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacteeial strains and growth media . 
All strains are derivatives of S. typhimurium LT2 or of E. coli K-12 . 
Their genotypes and sources are detailed in Table 1 . 
Transductions in S. typhimurium were carried out with a high-transducing derivative of phage P22 int4 as described by Roth ( 37 ) . 
E. coli transductions were with phage P1 vir ( 32 ) . 
After transduction of any transposon or Mu derivative , the correct location of the element and the presence of only a single copy of that element in the transductant were checked by marker rescue . 
Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C unless otherwise stated . 
For strain constructions cells were grown in LB medium ( 37 ) . 
For all other experiments the growth medium used was LOM ( low-osmolarity medium [ 6 ] ) , which contains 0.4 mM MgSO4 , 6 , uM ( NH4 ) 2SO4 . 
FeSO4 , 20 mM ( NH4 ) 2HP04 , 10 mM bistrispropane , 5 mM NaCl , 10 mM glucose , and 1 mM KCl . 
For certain experiments the potassium concentration was varied by adding extra KCl as appropriate . 
For potassium limitation KCl was omitted ; flame photometry showed the potassium concentration in this `` potassium-free '' medium to be < 8 1xM . 
Isolation of a stable proU-lacZ fusion in S. typhimurium . 
Although we have previously constructed pro U-lacZ operon fusions with the Mu derivatives Mu dl and Mu dl-8 ( 7 ) , a mini-Mu derivative ( Mu dJ , originally called Mu dI1734 ; [ 10 ] ) has recently been described which lacks all transposition functions and is therefore completely stable . 
A Mu dJ-mediated proU-lacZ fusion was isolated by transducing LT2 to Kanr with a P22 lysate of TT10288 . 
TT10288 contains a his : : Mu dJ insertion and , in addition , a very closely linked Mu dl helper phage that provides the genes encoding transposition functions and that can be copackaged with the Mu dJ in P22 transducing particles . 
About 104 Kanr colonies , each of which contained an independent Mu dJ insertion into the chromosome , were pooled , washed twice in minimal medium , and plated on LOM-agar plates containing 0.3 M NaCl and 40 , ug of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-3-D-galactoside per ml . 
Deep blue ( Lac ' ) colonies were picked and screened on LOM-agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - , - D-galactoside but lacking the added NaCl . 
Any colonies which expressed 3-galactosidase on the plates containing 0.3 M NaCl but remained white ( Lac - ) on low-salt plates were purified and characterized further . 
On the basis of previous results ( 7 ) we anticipated that most of these isolates would contain proU-lacZ fusions . 
One such derivative , CH1301 , was shown to contain a single Mu dJ insertion , and the insertion was shown to be in proU by transductional mapping and marker rescue as described previously ( 7 ) . 
Expression of , B-galactosidase from this fusion was regulated in a manner identical to that reported previously for Mu dl-8-mediated pro U-lacZ fusions ( 7 ) . 
proU-lacZ fusions in E. coli . 
A mini-Mu-mediated proU-lacZ operon fusion was selected from a collection of random Mu dI1681 insertions . 
These random mini-Mu insertions were constructed by infection of MC4100 ( 9 ) with a temper-ature-induced lysate of strain POI1681 , which contains both the mini-Mu and a Mu helper phage ( 10 ) . 
pro'U - lacZ fusions were selected from this pool as described above for the S. typhimurium fusions , except that MacConkey mediumlactose was used as an indicator rather than 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-p-D-galactoside . 
As for S. typhimurium , all osmotically induced lacZ fusions selected in this manner mapped to a single locus which was shown to be proU by cotransduction with a srl : : TnJO insertion . 
kdp-lacZ fusions were not selected by this procedure since MacConke medium-lactose plates contain sufficient K + to fully repress kdp expression . 
As discussed below , proU-lacZ fusions isolated in E. coli were found to be regulated in a matiner identical to that of the more completely characterized pro UlacZ fusions in S. typhimurium . 
Stabilized kdp-lacZ fusion . 
The E. coli kdpAS : : Mu dl ( Apr lac ) fusion ( 26 ) was stabilized by selecting temperature-resistant colonies at 42 °C . 
These temperature-resistant de-rivatives were screened for the absence of Mu dl transposition when transduced into a Mu-free strain . 
One such stabilized kdp-lacZ fusion transduced into MJF1 ( 38 ) ; was the resultant strain , MJF261 , shown contain single was to a Mu dl insertion , and the insertion was shown to be in kdp , by marker rescue and genetic mapping . 
This stabilized fusion was used for all experiments with kdp and is referred to as kdpAS : : Mu dlX . 
Growth of cells under potassium limitation . 
Cells grown overnight in LOM were washed twice in LOM lacking KCl and resuspended in the same K + - free medium at a 1:50 dilution . 
Cells stopped growing at an optical density at 600 nm of about 0.3 ( see Fig. 3 ) . 
Since growth could be rapidly restored to normal rates by the addition of 1 mM KCl , we concluded that growth was indeed limited by potassium . 
Osmotic stress . 
The two osmolytes used routinely were 0.3 M NaCl and 0.44 M sucrose . 
These are isoosmotic concentrations of the two solutes . 
Cells were osmotically stressed in one of two ways . 
Steady-state adaptation to osmotic stress was achieved by growing cells overnight in the presence of the appropriate osmolyte , subculturing the cell into the same medium at a 1:50 dilution , And growing to the midexponential phase before assaying . 
Alternatively , a rapid osmotic shock was achieved by growing cells to midexponential growth in LOM medium before adding sucrose to 0.44 M or NaCl to 0.3 M. Pulse-labeling . 
Samples ( 1.0 ml ) of cells grown as indicated below were pulsed for 2 min with [ 35S ] methionine ( 800 Ci mmol-1 ; 5 , uCi ) followed by a 2-min chase with unlabeled methionine ( 100 , ug ml - ' ) . 
The cells were then rapidly sedimented by centrifugation , resuspended in 50 , u1 of Laemnli sample buffer ( 25 ) , boiled for 2 min , and separated on a 9 % sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel ( 2 , 25 ) . 
Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography after the gel was dried . 
, - Galactosidase assays . 
, - Galactosidase was assayed by the procedure of Miller ( 32 ) . 
Cells were permeabilized by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-chloroform procedure . 
All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated on at least three independent occasions . 
Measurement of intracellular KV . 
Cells were grown to the midexponential phase in LOM containing NaCl , KCl , and betaine as appropriate . 
Cells from 1 ml of culture were rapidly harvested by centrifugation for 30 s in an Eppendorf a Cells of S. typhimurium CH1301 ( proU-lacZ ) , E. coli MJF261 ( kdp-lacZ ) , and E. coli CH1366 ( proU-lacZ ) to the midexponential phase in were grown LOM , with osmolytes and K + added as indicated , and assayed for , - galactosidase activity .

centrifuge , all of the supernatant was removed , and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of deionized water . 
The suspension was boiled for I min to release k ' from the cell , and the K + concentration was determined by flame photometry . 
Each data point is an average of at least three separate determinations that did not vary by more than - + -10 % . 
Results obtained with this inexpensive and rapid procedure were very similar to those obtained with 42K ( see below ) . 
Cell volumes were determined by the distribution of 3H20 and [ 14C ] sucrose by the method of Stock et al. ( 39 ) as described previously ( 1 ) . 
Values obtained for cell volumes were consistent with previously reported results ( 34 , 39 ) . 
Increasing the osmolarity of LOM by adding 0.3 M NaCl caused a decrease in cell volume of approximately 35 % ( from 3.0 to 1.95 , ul mg - ' ) . 
Measurement of relative intracellular K + and betaine concentrations . 
Cells were grown to saturation in LOM containing 0.3 M NaCl , harvested by centrifugation , and suspended at 10 mg of protein per ml in LOM containing chloramphen-icol ( 50 , ug ml - ' ) and NaCl as appropriate . 
42KHCO3 ( 150 mCi mmol-1 ) and [ 14C ] betaine ( 10 mCi mmol-1 ) were added to a final concentration of 1 mM , and the cells were incubated at 20 °C for 90 min . 
Preliminary experiments showed this to be sufficient time for equilibration of the internal and external pools . 
Cells were then collected by filtration through a 0.45-p . 
m membrane filter ( Millipore Corp. ) and washed in the same medium in which they had been incubated but lacking the radioisotopes , and the 42K ' and [ 14C ] betaine accumulated by the cells were determined by scintillation counting . 
Due to the very short half-life of 42K and the overlap of the scintillation windows , the 14C was counted after allowing sufficient time for 42K decay . 
RESULTS
Because direct assays for proU and kdp function are difficult to perform , expression of these genes was assessed by assaying 0-galactosidase expression from isolates with kdp-lacZ or proU-lacZ operon fusions . 
Assays were performed during steady-state growth in the appropriate me-dium , rather than after sudden osmotic shock , unless otherwise indicated . 
The proU gene and the ProU transport system are considerably better characterized in S. typhimurium than they are in E. coli . 
However , strains with kdp-lacZ fusions have never been isolated in S. typhimurium ; despite several attempts with various selections , we have so far been unabl to isolate strains with such fusions in this species . 
This suggests there may be some differences in the Kdp system between these two species . 
However , any difference is likely to be minor , for example , in the affinity of the transport system for its substrate , rather than a major difference in the actual mechanism of kdp regulation . 
It is known that S. typhimurium possesses a Kdp transport system , the genes have been cloned by virtue of their sequence homology to the E. coli kdp genes ( W. Epstein , personal communication ) , and , like in E. coli , the Kdp proteins of S. typhimurium are induced by potassium starvation ( 3 ; unpublished results ) . 
We have therefore studied the regulation of kdp expression in E. coli MJF261 and the regulation of proU expression primarily in S. typhimurium CH1301 . 
However , to exclude the possibility that the differences in regulation we observe between proU and kdp ( see below ) are due to a species difference , and to show that these differences are not a consequence of any species difference in Kdp , also we isolated a proU-lacZ fusion in E. coli ( CH1366 ) and repeated some experiments with this species . 
As described below , no significant difference in the regulation of proU expression was seen between E. coli and S. typhimurium . 
Potassium limitation induces kdp but not proU . 
In minimalsalts medium , K + accumulation provides the principal means of maintaining cell turgor ( 16 ) . 
When cells are grown under potassium limitation , potassium can not be accumulated to sufficient intracellular concentrations to maintain cell turgor , and any turgor-sensitive gene would be expected be induced . 
Strains containing either to a proU-lacZ or a kdp-lacZ fusion were grown under potassium limitation ( < 8

, uM ) , and P-galactosidase activity was assayed ( Table 2 ) . 
Our results with kdp-lacZ fusions were in full agreement with those of Laimins et al. ( 26 ) ; expression of kdp at low osmolarity was strongly induced by potassium limitation ( < 8 , uM K + ) . 
However , under identical growth conditions no induction of proU expression was observed in either E. coli or S. typhimurium . 
This indicates an important difference from the regulation of kdp and , in addition , implies that the expression of proU can not be simply in response to changes in cell turgor . 
Excess potassium represses kdp but not proU . 
When sufficient potassium is present in the growth medium it is accumulated by the cell to restore turgor . 
It is well established that intracellular potassium concentrations increase in more or less direct proportion to external osmolarity , both to a Cells were grown under potassium limitation ( 50 , uM ) or excess ( 1 mM ) in medium containing 0.3 M NaCl , and , B-galactosidase activity was assayed during midexponential growth . 
Leucine ( 1 mM ) was included in the growth medium for CH776 to induce expression of tppB ( 23 ) . 
oppA ( 23 ) and putP ( 8 ) are both constitutively expressed under these growth conditions maintain an osmotic balance and to restore turgor ( 16 ; see below ) . 
Thus , during steady-state growth at high osmolarity in the presence of excess potassium ( 50 mM ) , sufficient K + can be accumulated to partially or completely restore turgor , and expression of turgor-sensitive genes would be expected to be repressed . 
Consistent with this , and with the view that kdp is turgor regulated , we found that kdp was not expressed during steady-state growth in medium of high osmolarity as long as sufficient K + ( 50 mM ) was present ( Table 2 ) . 
However , at lower K + concentrations ( 1 mM ) , turgor could not be maintained in these Kdp - strains , and kdp expression was induced . 
In marked contrast to kdp , expression of proU was maintained at a fully induced level during steady-state growth at high osmolarity , even in the presence of 50 mM K + ( Table 2 ) . 
Again , there was no obvious difference in the regulation of proU-lacZ fusions in E. coli and S. typhi-murium . 
These results illustrate another clear difference between kdp and proU and again imply that induction of proU expression can not be a direct response to changes in cell turgor . 
Effect of kdp mutations on proU expression . 
Because the pro U-lacZ strains are Kdp + , whereas the kdp-lacZ strain we used is phenotypically Kdp - , it is important to ascertain that the differences in regulation between proU and kdp are not simply a result of the presence or absence of the Kdp transport system . 
Thus , a kdp : : TnlO insertion was introduced into an E. coli proU-lacZ fusion strain , and the expression of proU was compared with that of its Kdp + parent ( Table 3 ) . 
The differences in the regulation of proU and kdp can not be attributed to the presence or absence of a functional Kdp system . 
As expected ( 16 , 26 ) , growth of the Kdp - derivative was limited by potassium even at extracellular concentrations as high as 350 , uM ( data not shown ) . 
This is because the remaining K + transport system , Trk , has a low affinity for K + ( K , = 1 mM ) and is unable to accumulate K + at sufficient rates to maintain optimal intracellular concentrations ( see below ) . 
In contrast , the Kdp + derivative grew normally at both 100 and 350 , uM K + . 
proU expression was not induced by K + limitation , even when such limitation was made more severe by the introduction of a kdp mutation ( Table 3 ) . 
Similarly , expression of proU was not repressed by excess K + ( 50 mM ) in either the Kdp - or the Kdp + derivative . 
The only effect of introducing a kdp lesion was that proU expression at high osmolarity was reduced when extracellular K + concentrations were low enough ( 100 or 350 j , M ) to be limiting for K + accumulation . 
This is in contrast to the Kdp + derivative , where K + does not become limiting at these extracellular concentrations ( see below ) and where proU expression remains relatively constant even at low extracellular K + concentrations . 
Thus , when the cell can not accumulate sufficient K + to restore turgor and maintain optimum growth rates , osmotic stress is increased , yet proU expression is actually reduced . 
Significantly , these results are completely opposite to those found for kdp , which is induced rather than repressed as K + becomes limiting ( Table 2 ) , and confirm that proU and kdp are induced by very different signals . 
These observations suggest that intracellular potassium concentrations may be important in regulating proU expression . 
proU is induced under conditions where intracellular potassium concentrations would be expected to be high and is repressed when intracellular potassium concentrations would be expected to be low . 
To confirm these interpretations , we measured intracellular potassium concentrations under the various growth conditions ( Table 4 ) . 
In Kdp + strains , intracellular K + concentrations were found not to vary significantly with various extracellular concentrations between 100 puM and 50 mM but to increase with increasing medium osmolarity . 
This is in excellent agreement with the data of Epstein and Schultz ( 16 ) . 
In contrast , in a Kdpstrain intracellular potassium levels are reduced at extracellular levels below the of Trk and 350 potassium K , ( 100 , uM ) . 
Again , these data are consistent with published results ( 26 ) ; in addition , the reduced intracellular K + concentrations correlate well with reduced growth rates under the same conditions ( data not shown ) . 
In all cases , the measured intracellular concentrations of K + ions , altered by varyin the extracellular K + concentrations or medium osmolarity or by introducing kdp mutations , are compatible with the view that induction of proU is dependent upon the accumulation of intracellular potassium . 
Expression of proU depends upon intracellular potassium . 
The data above show that kdp and proU expression is regulated differently and demonstrate that proU can not respond directly to changes in turgor . 
Other than turgor , the most direct physiological response to osmotic stress is the accumulation of K + ions within the cell . 
In the absence of osmoprotectants such as betaine , intracellular K + concentrations increase in proportion to extracellular osmolarity ( 16 ; this paper ) . 
It therefore seemed possible that proU expression might be determined by the intracellular concentration of K + ions . 
This hypothesis is strongly supported by the data presented above , which show that proU expression is induced whenever intracellular K + concentrations are high and is repressed whenever concentrations are low . 
( i ) Iso-osmotic concentrations of different osmolytes which increase intracellular K + to similar extents ( 16 ) have similar effects on the induction of proU . 
( ii ) At high osmolarity the intracellular K + concentration remains high , even when sufficient extracellular K + is supplied to permit restoration of turgor ( 16 ) . 
proU expression is fully induced under these conditions even during steady-state growth . 
( iii ) Potassium limitation , which reduces intracellular K + concentrations , does not induce proU expression even though the cell is under turgor stress . 
( iv ) In a Kdp - strain , proU expression at high osmolarity is considerably reduced when the external K + concentrations are low . 
These K + concentrations are below the K , for Trk ( 36 ) , and the ability of the Kdp - strain to accumulate sufficient intracellular K + becomes limiting . 
To test this hypothesis , strain CH946 ( proU-lacZ ) was grown under K + limitation ( 50 , uM ) in medium containing 0.3 M NaCl . 
After 3 h of growth , expression of proU was reduced to less than 50 % of the level in cells grown with 1 mM K + . 
Expression of several control fusions of lacZ to other genes ( opp , tpp , and putP ) was essentially identical whatever the extracellular K + concentration ( Table 5 ) . 
These results imply that K + ions play a specific role in proU expression . 
To define more precisely the effects of K + ions on proU expression , cells from an overnight culture of strain CH1301 were washed in LOM lacking K + ( < 8 , uM K + ) , and resuspended at a 1:50 dilution in the same medium . 
Growth was followed by monitoring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm ( Fig. 1 ) . 
At an optical density of about 0.3 , growth ceased due to potassium starvation ; growth could be restored to normal by the addition of potassium to the medium . 
At various stages during growth ( arrows in Fig. 1 ) , cells were taken and osmotically shocked by adding sucrose to a final concentration of 0.44 M. IfproU induction were mediated by an increase in internal K + concentrations , then an osmotic shock under K + limitation would not be expected to induce expression . 
However , if K + ( 1 mM ) were added at the same time as the osmotic shock is given , this will be accumulated and normal induction would be anticipated ; this is precisely what was observed ( Table 6 ) . 
Expression of proU was not induced by osmotic shock unless K + ions were provided . 
Essentially identical results were obtained with a pro U-lacZ fusion in E. coli ( data not shown ) . 
When this experiment was repeated with NaCl as the osmolyte , significant induction of proU was seen even when the osmotic shock was given in

FIG. 1 . 
Growth of cells under potassium limitation . 
An overnight culture of S. typhimurium CH1301 ( proU-lacZ ) grown in LOM containing 1 mM KCl was washed twice in LOM lacking K + ( < 8 , uM K + ) and resuspended at a 1:50 dilution in the same medium . 
Growth was followed by monitoring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm ( O.D. 6m ) . 
After about 5 h , growth ceased due to K + limitation ; growth could be rapidly restored by adding 1 mM KCl . 
The arrows indicate the points at which samples were taken for osmotic shock ( see text and Table 6 ) . 
[ K1 mM FIG. 3 . 
Effect of different osmolytes on kdp expression . 
Cells of E. coli MJF261 ( kdp-lacZ ) were grown overnight in LOM containing the indicated concentrations of KCI and added osmolytes as appropriate , and , B-galactosidase activity was assayed . 
Symbols : x , no added osmolyte ; E , grown in 0.44 M sucrose ; 0 , grown in 0.3 M NaCl the absence of added K + . 
However , this was found to be an artifact , since 0.3 M NaCl ( Analar grade ) contains approximately 50 , uM K + as a contaminant , sufficient to permit proU induction in a Kdp + strain . 
Because cell growth was reduced and eventually halted by potassium limitation during these experiments , it was important to establish that protein synthesis was identical whether or not potassium was added at the same time as the cells were given the osmotic shock . 
Thus , cells were grown and osmotically shocked under conditions identical to those described above , but instead of assaying , B-galactosidase we pulse-labeled cells with [ 35S ] methionine . 
The labeled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Quite clearly , protein synthesis is unaffected by K + starvation and is essentially identical whether or not K + is supplied at the same time as the cells are shocked . 
Presumably , the internal K + concentration is maintained at a sufficient level for normal ribosome function but at insufficient levels to restore turgor and permit growth . 
As a further control , we wished to show that lacZ expression from promoters other than pro U could be induced under conditions of potassium starvation . 
Unlike proU-lacZ fusions , isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction of chromosomally encoded lacZ and the induction of a tppB-lacZ fusion by leucine were little affected by potassium starvation ( Table 6 ) . 
Thus , neither protein synthesis nor the specific synthesis of P-galactosidase was significantly reduced by K + starvation . 
It must therefore be concluded that proU expression requires the accumulation of intracellular K + ions . 
Different osmolytes have different effects on kdp induction . 
The expression of kdp is induced by sudden osmotic shock with any osmolyte ( with the exception of glycerol , which is freely permeable through the membrane and hence does not cause a change in turgor ) ( 26 ) . 
In apparent contradiction , it has been reported ( 17 ) that during steady-state growth at a Cells of strains CH946 ( proU-lacZ ) and MJF261 ( kdp-lacZ ) were grown in LOM containing K + , proline-betaine , and NaCI as indicated . 
lB-Galactosidase activity was assayed at midexponential growth . 
b ND , Not determined . 
high osmolarity kdp is induced by ionic solutes but not by nonionic solutes at equivalent osmolarity . 
To resolve this problem we examined the effects of different osmolytes on kdp expression in more detail . 
Cells were assayed for kdp expression after growth in medium containing various amounts of K + . 
In the absence of any added osmolyte , expression of kdp depended upon the extracellular K + concentration ; kdp was expressed in low K + and repressed by high K + ( Fig. 3 ) . 
This is in complete agreement with the data of Laimins et al. ( 26 ) and implies that at K + concentrations below about 5 mM , potassium uptake via Trk is insufficient to fully restore turgor and hence kdp is induced . 
Significantly , the K , of Trk , the only remaining K + transport system in this Kdp - strain , is around 1 mM ( 36 ) . 
When the same experiment was carried out for cells grown with 0.44 M sucrose or 0.3 M choline chloride added as an osmolyte , the response to various levels of K + was unaltered . 
Thus , even though the increased osmolarity increases the intracellular K + concentration , it seems that the rate of K + uptake required to maintain this intracellular concentration is unaffected . 
In contrast , NaCl at an equivalent osmolarity ( 0.3 M ) shifted the response curve such that higher concentrations of K + were required to fully repress kdp expression . 
Thus , both ionic and nonionic solutes induce kdp expression at the steady state , although solutes containing Na + ions shift the K + response curve slightly . 
This shift in the K + response curve accounts for the failure of Gowrishankar to observe induction of kdp by nonionic solutes ( 17 ) ; he measured the induction of kdp at just a single K + concentration which happened to be that concentration at which the differences between ionic and nonionic solutes are most marked . 
The most probable explanation for the effect of Na + ions on the K + response curve is that , unlike sucrose and choline chloride , Na + ions either decrease the activity of Trk ( kdp is mutated in these strains ) and hence reduce the rate of K + uptake at any given extracellular K + concentration or , alternatively , that Na + ions increase the rate of K + efflux . 
Betaine and proline have different effects on kdp and proU expression . 
It is well known that betaine or proline can enhance the growth rate of cells at high osmolarity ( 6 , 7 , 29 , 34 ) . 
These solutes can play two distinct roles in osmoprotection ; they contribute to the restoration of cell turgor , and they are able to protect enzymes against the adverse effect of high ionic strength ( 21 , 28 , 33 , 45 ) . 
During growth at high osmolarity in 1 mM K + , which in a kdp strain limits turgor and induces kdp expression ( Table 2 ) ( 26 ) , betaine markedly enhances growth rate ( Fig. 4 ) . 
However , even when strains are grown at high osmolarity in excess K + ( 50 mM ) , which is believed to restore turgor and fully represses kdp expression , growth rates are still significantly enhanced by betaine . 
It is , of course , possible that turgor is only partially restored by K + accumulation , even in the presence of excess extracellular K + , and that betaine results in full restoration of turgor and thereby enhances growth . 
However , this explanation seems improbable because it has been demonstrated that at these osmolarities sufficient K + can be accumulated to restore turgor ( 16 ) . 
More probably , the enhancement of growth rates by betaine in excess potassium is not due to restoration of turgor but to protection of enzyme function from high intracellular ionic strength . 
Interestingly , at low K + concentrations ( 100 p , M ) betaine does not enhance growth , implying that at these concentrations K + itself is growth limiting . 
The effects of proline and betaine on proU and kdp expression were examined ( Table 7 ) . 
Cells were assayed during steady-state growth in LOM ( 1 mM K + ) at high osmolarity ( 0.3 M NaCl ) , with 1 mM betaine or 1 mM proline or both added as appropriate . 
As we have reported previously ( 7 ) , expression of proU in S. typhimurium is considerably reduced by added betaine or proline . 
This effect is not simply an effect of growth rate on pro U expression ; altering the growth rate in other ways ( i.e. , amino acid starvation ) did not influence proU expression . 
Interestingly , betaine caused a greater reduction in proU expression than did proline . 
The significance of this observation is discussed below . 
Similar results were obtained for pro U-lacZ fusions in E. coli ( data not presented ) . 
In contrast , the addition of betaine or proline to the growth medium had little or no effect on the expression of kdp . 
In fact , betaine actually increased kdp expression slightly . 
The absence of any major effect of betaine on kdp expression is in agreement with the growth data presented above , which imply that betaine does not play a role in restoring cell turgor under these conditions . 
These data provide yet another distinction between the regulation of proU and kdp expression . 
If , as implied by our data above , proU expression were dependent upon intracellular potassium concentrations , we would predict that betaine and proline , which reduce proU expression , also reduce the intracellular K + pools . 
Table 4 shows that this is indeed the case . 
However , despite their rather different effects on proU expression , proline and betaine actually reduce the intracellular K + pools to similar extents . 
The implications of this apparently inconsistent result are discussed below . 
It should be noted that Gowrishankar reported that the addition of proline to the growth medium does not affect proU expression ( 17 ) , in apparent contradiction to the results reported here . 
However , his experiments were carried out at 0.4 M NaCl , at which osmolarity proline uptake is effectively abolished in a proU strain ( 6 , 7 ) . 
In addition , we show below that there is a difference between growth at 0.3 and 0.4 M NaCl in terms of the relative roles of K + and betaine in restoring cell turgor . 
Distinct roles for K + and betaine at different osmolarities . 
Because expression of proU is only fully induced at relatively high extracellular osmolarities , once a significant intracellular K + concentration has already been achieved , it seemed possible that K + and betaine might play rather distinct roles in osmoprotection . 
We therefore measured the relative amounts of K + and betaine accumulated by cells grown at different osmolarities . 
As the osmolarity was increased the relative role of betaine as the intracellular osmolyte became more important ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In media containing 50 mM NaCl , betaine accounted for less than 10 % of the total pool of the two osmolytes , whereas at 0.8 M NaCl betaine accounted for more than 80 % of this pool . 
DISCUSSION It is now well established that the transcription of two bacterial genes , kdp and proU , is determined primarily by osmotic stress ( 7 , 15 , 17 , 26 ) . 
However , in neither case is the molecular basis of this regulation understood . 
The elegant studies of Epstein have led to the conclusion that expression of the kdp operon is induced in response to a lowering of cell turgor and that induction of kdp is independent of either intracellular or extracellular K + concentrations ( 26 ) . 
This system provides a reference point for the investigation of the expression of other genes under osmotic control . 
The finding that expression of proU , like that of kdp , is induced in cells under osmotic stress ( 7 , 15 , 17 ) implied that this gene might also be sensitive to changes in turgor . 
However , the data presented here illustrate a number of important differences between the regulation of proU and kdp expression . 
( i ) Expression of kdp during growth at low osmolarity is induced by potassium starvation , whereas proU remains repressed . 
( ii ) Expression of kdp during growth at high osmolarity is repressed by added potassium , whereas expression of proU remains unaffected . 
( iii ) Expression of kdp in cells grown at high osmolarity is unaffected by the addition of betaine or proline , whereas expression ofproU is significantly reduced . 
These data quite clearly demonstrate a difference in the osmotic regulation of the two genes . 
It is also clear from these observations that changes in turgor can not directly influence proU expression . 
For example , proU is not expressed under potassium limitation , which reduces turgor . 
Similarly , proU is expressed during steady-state growth at high osmolarity , even in the presence of excess potassium which results in the substantial , if not complete , restoration of turgor . 
We have now obtained strong evidence that proU expression is induced in response to an increase in intracellular K concentrations . 
We have manipulated the intracellular po-tassium concentrations in a number of ways , by altering medium osmolarity , by limiting potassium availability , and by introducing potassium transport mutants . 
The changes in intracellular K + concentrations resulting from these procedures have been measured and are in excellent agreement with previously published results ( 16 , 26 ; Epstein , in press ) . 
We find a strong correlation between proU expression and intracellular potassium : ( i ) increases in external osmolarity , which result in a corresponding increase in intracellular K + , induce proU . 
( ii ) Potassium starvation , which leads to turgor stress but does not increase intracellular K + , does not induce proU . 
( iii ) At high osmolarity , limitation of K + ( either by starvation or by introducing potassium transport lesions ) decreases proU expression , despite the fact that this limitation increases turgor stress . 
It should of course be remembered that the induction curve for proU expression is sigmiodal ( 7 , 17 ) , implying cooperativity , and that consequently a precise linear relationship between K + concentrations and proU expression would not be anticipated . 
To more critically demonstrate a requirement for potassium , we have shown that sudden osmotic shock fails to induce proU when potassium is limiting for growth , even though protein synthesis and the induction of other genes are unaffected by K + starvation . 
Thus , the accumulation of intracellular K + seems to be both required and sufficient for the induction of proU . 
The only circumstances in which the correlation between K + concentrations and proU expression breaks down is when betaine and proline are provided in the growth medium . 
However , the lack of correlation here can readily be explained by roles for betaine and proline other than in turgor regulation ( see below ) . 
How might intracellular potassium effect the induction of proU ? 
One possibility is that the interaction of RNA polymerase with the proU promoter is directly influenced by ionic strength . 
It is well known that ionic strength can alter promoter function in vitro , and increases in ionic strength of the magnitude which occurs under severe osmotic stress might induce structural transitions in DNA . 
More probably a cytoplasmic regulatory protein is involved in modulating proU expression . 
This protein would undergo a conformational change in response to increased concentrations of intracellular potassium and activate proU transcription . 
Either a positive or a negative regulatory protein might be involved . 
Such a conformational change could be achieved in one of two ways . 
The simplest hypothesis is that K + binds to a specific site on the protein . 
This site would have a binding constant for K + of around 150 mM , the concentration which results in half-maximal expression of proU ( 7 , 17 ) . 
Alternatively , the conformational changes in the putative regulatory protein could simply be the result of sensitivity of the protein structure to fluctuations in ionic strength . 
Such a model permits an explanation for the finding that betaine causes a greater reduction in the expression of proU than does proline , whereas both have similar effects on intracellular K + concentrations . 
It is well known that betaine is a better osmoprotectant than proline ( 6 ) and that it is better able to protect proteins from ionic or other denatur-ation ( 30 , 31 , 33 , 45 ) . 
The different effects of betaine and proline on proU expression may therefore reflect their relative efficiencies at protecting the putative regulatory protein from conformational changes at high internal ionic strength . 
We have shown that , under the conditions used here , betaine is able to enhance growth rates even under conditions where sufficient potassium is present to restore turgor and that therefore betaine must be providing another function such as the protection of proteins against denatur-ation . 
It is interesting to note that the induction profile for proU expression is sigmoidal with respect to osmolarity ( 7 ) . 
This is compatible with a model in which the putative proU regulatory protein is a dimer ( or larger oligomer ) and that renaturation-denaturation by K + involves a monomer-dimer transition . 
Betaine has been shown in vitro to facilitate the multimerization of proteins under otherwise dissociating conditions ( 21 ) . 
Although unlikely , it is of course possible that K + ions act indirectly . 
For example , it may be that the glutamate , which is synthesized in response to K + accumulation to restore the ionic balance ( 41 ) , provides the actual signal for proU induction . 
Alternatively , the signal may simply be an effect of ionic strength within the cell , to which K + makes the major contribution . 
Since the intracellular concentration of Na + is maintained at a low level compared with that of K + ( 16 ) , it is not possible to distinguish in vivo whether K + functions in a specific manner or is simply the primary contributing ion to an overall increase in intracellular ionic strength . 
We are currently testing this possibility in an in vitro system . 
However , even if the effects of K + are indirect , the accumulation of K + still remains the primary event that leads to the induction of proU expression . 
The differential regulation of proU and kdp expression is entirely consistent with the different roles played by betaine and potassium in osmoregulation . 
We have found that at low osmolarities potassium is the principal osmotic species , whereas at higher osmolarities betaine ( when available ) becomes more important . 
Because K + , unlike betaine , is almost always available to cells it is clearly the most appropriate primary osmoprotectant and , when cells are subjected to mild osmotic stress , is accumulated to restore turgor . 
However , at high external osmolarities the correspondingly higher intracellular K + concentrations are potentially deleterious to enzyme function and can reduce growth rates . 
Thus , if it is available , betaine is taken up in preference to K + . 
The accumulated betaine contributes to the restoration of turgor , reducing the need to accumulate potentially deleterious levels of K + . 
In addition , betaine is known to protect proteins from ionic denaturation ( 4 , 45 ) and may therefore also serve to protect intracellular enzymes from inhibition by the K + ions which are accumulated . 
Thus , the cell possesses an integrated response to achieve optimum growth at different osmolarities . 
This scheme is best achieved by inducing the expression of the potassium uptake system ( kdp ) in response to changes in turgor and of the betaine uptake system ( proU ) in response to intracellular K + concentrations .
