Stress-inducible gene of Salmonella typhimurium identified by arbitrarily primed PCR of RNA
ABSTRACT Fingerprinting of RNA by arbitrarily primed PCR ( RAP ) can be used to identify conditionaily expressed genes in prokaryotes . 
Differential gene expression in Salmo-neUa typhimurium LT2 in response to peroxide treatment was examined as a system in which to demonstrate this strategy . 
This treatment models the induction of bacterial protective proteins that may occur when mammalian phagocytes use peroxide to fight S. typhimurium infection . 
To identify genes inducible by hydrogen peroxide stress , total RNA from per-oxide-treated and untreated bacterial cultures were RAP rm-gerprinted with six different arbitrarily selected primers . 
A 435-base RAP product that was differentialy amplified by RAP using the reverse sequencing primer was cloned and sequenced . 
Northern blot analysis confirmed that the RNA corresponding to this clone , RSP435 , was induced when bacteria were treated with hydrogen peroxide . 
The RNA was not induced in an oxyRI mutant that constitutively expresses a subset of hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes . 
Using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization to an array of induced Mud-P22 integrations , the gene corresponding to RSP435 was mapped to two places , one between 19 and 21.5 min and one between 56 and 57 min . 
Thus , two similar or identical stress-inducible genes were found in different parts of the genome . 
Identification , cloning , and mapping of the conditionaHly expressed RSP435 cDNA were performed entirely by physical means , demonstrating that the strategy should complement genetic methods for many prokaryotic or archaebacterial systems and should be applicable to organisms in which genetic methods are difficult to perform or have not yet been developed . 
Two similar methods for fingerprinting of eukaryotic RNA have been developed ( 1 , 2 ) based on arbitrarily primed PCR ( RAP ) ( 3 , 4 ) . 
In principle , fingerprinting of RNA by RAP ( 1 , 5 ) can be used on prokaryotic RNAs because it does not rely on poly ( A ) - tailed RNA that is rare in mRNAs isolated from bacteria ( 6 ) . 
To demonstrate that the method can be used to identify differentially expressed genes of bacteria we searched for stress-induced RNAs in Salmonella typhimu-rium . 
Enterobacteria respond to various stimuli such as oxidative stress , extreme pH , anaerobiosis , heat shock , osmotic shock , and starvation , by changing the expression of groups of genes termed `` stimulons '' ( 7 , 29 ) . 
Assorted genetic tools have been used to study these regulatory networks , including operon fusions ( 8 ) , promoter probe plasmids ( 9 , 10 ) , and positively selected promoter probes ( 11 ) . 
An example of the differential expression of sets of genes due to external stimuli is the response of S. typhimurium to oxidative stress . 
When bacteria invade the mammalian host , activated granulocytes may employ millimolar concentrations of peroxide and superoxide anion during phagocytosis in an attempt to kill the bacteria ( 12 , 13 ) . 
In response , the bacteria can induce stimu ¬

lons , including those under the control of oxyR ( 12 ) . 
Although the exact roles of genes induced by peroxide stress are unknown , the induction of some of these genes is required to maintain virulence . 
In this report , we describe the application of RAP to identify genes in S. typhimurium that are induced by H202 stress .

Peroxide-Induced Stress . 
S. typhimurium LT2 ( wild type ) and the LT2 derivative strain TA4100 ( oxyRI ) ( 12 ) were grown aerobically as described ( 19 ) . 
A 1 % inoculum of overnight aerobic culture was grown to logarithmic phase ( OD65o = 0.4 ) in L broth . 
The culture was immediately split into two aliquots and H202 was added to one of the aliquots to a final concentration of 0.38 mM . 
This level of H202 is less than that needed to stop the growth of the cells , is a fraction of the level that the cells are thought to experience during phagocytosis ( 13 ) , yet is sufficient to prepare cells for survival in 10 mM H202 , which would otherwise be lethal . 
After H202 was added , the cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for either 30 min or 120 min . 
At each time interval , 10 ml of the culture was removed and frozen immediately in a dry ice/ethanol bath . 
RNA Preparation . 
RNA was isolated by the hot phenol extraction procedure ( 20 ) . 
The 10 ml of frozen cell culture was thawed and harvested by centrifugation in a 15-ml Corex tube at 10,000 rpm for 10 min . 
Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 30 mM NaOAc ( pH 5.2 ) . 
Fifty microliters of 20 % SDS and 0.5 ml of phenol ( equilibrated with 30 mM NaOAc to pH 5.2 ) were added . 
The mixture was spun in a Vortex for a few seconds to form an emulsion and placed in a 65 °C water bath for 10 min ( with Vortex mixing at 2.5-min intervals ) . 
The aqueous phase was then separated from the phenol phase by microcentrifugation for 5 min . 
The aqueous phase was extracted with phenol at 65 °C and then once with chloroform at room temperature . 
RNA was precipitated with 1/4 vol of 3 M NaOAc and 3 vol of ethanol . 
The RNA was then treated with RNase-free DNase I or pelleted in a CsCl gradient ( 21 ) . 
Total RNA was dissolved in water and the different RNA preparations were adjusted to equal concentrations . 
The relative concentrations of these final RNA stocks were compared by ethidium gel electrophoresis .

As a result , a Bln I fragment of about 200 kb , which corresponds to 18-21 .5 min , was `` dropped out '' from the Bln I-A fragment ( 1600 kb ) when the chromosome was digested with Bln I and resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) ( 17 , 18 ) . 
Fingerprinting of RNA . 
RAP was employed essentially as described by Welsh et al. ( 1 ) . 
Ten-microliter samples containing 3 ng , 12 ng , 50 ng , or 200 ng of RNA were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and then put on ice . 
Ten microliters of cDNA synthesis buffer containing 100 mM Tris HCl ( pH 8.3 ) , 100 mM KCI , 8 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM dNTPs , 1 , uM arbitrarily chosen primer , and 5 units of Moloney murine reverse transcriptase ( Stratagene ) was added . 
The first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 1 hr . 
After cDNA synthesis , 10 , l of buffer containing 2 mM Tris HCl ( pH 8.3 ) , 5 mM KCI , 4 mM MgC92 , 1 , uM of the same arbitrarily chosen primer , 1 , uCi of [ a-32P ] dCTP ( 1 Ci = 37 GBq ) , and 0.25 unit of Taq polymer-ase ( AmpliTaq , Cetus ) was added to the 20 - , lI cDNA sample . 
The thermal cycling parameters were as follows : 1 low stringency cycle ; 94 °C ( 5 min ) , 40 °C ( 5 min ) , 72 °C ( 5 min ) , then 30 high stringency cycles ; 94 °C ( 1 min ) , 60 °C ( 1 min ) , and 72 °C ( 2 min ) . 
The primers tested were the reverse sequencing primer ( RSP ) , GGAAACAGTCATGACCATGA ; LC , CCATGCGCATGCATGAGA ; LD , CCACACGCGCACACGGGA ; LE , CCGCACGCGCACGCAAGG ; LF , CCACGCGTGTGTGTGAAA ; and ZF9 , AGAGAGAAACCCACCAGA . 
Ten microliters of 80 % formamide , with bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes , was added to 2.5 , l of each PCR sample . 
The samples were heated to 65 °C for 15 min and 2.5 , ul of each was loaded on a standard 5 % polyacrylamide/50 % urea sequencing gel prepared in lx TBE ( lx TBE = 90 mM Tris/64 .6 mM boric acid/2 .5 mM EDTA , pH 8.3 ) and electrophoresed at 1500 V until the xylene cyanol dye had reached the bottom of the gel . 
The gel was dried under vacuum onto 3MM paper ( Whatman ) . 
The RAP fmgerprint was visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film . 
Isolation and Cloning of RAP Products . 
The autoradiogram was aligned with the gel using radioactive ink dots and bands were cut from the gel using a razor blade . 
The piece of acrylamide was placed in a centrifuge tube and the DNA was eluted for at least 1 hr at 65 °C into 50 , lI of TE . 
Five microliters of the eluent was PCR amplified in 50 Al using the standard PCR protocol ( Perkin-Elmer/Cetus ) , 0.25 , uCi of [ a-32P ] dCTP , and the same primer . 
The amplified material was checked against the initial RAP reaction by i-unning a second polyacrylamide gel . 
The products were blunt end cloned by standard methods ( 20 ) into the Srf I site of the pCR-script SK ( + ) vector ( Stratagene ) , mobilized into single-stranded phage , and sequenced using the Sequenase kit ( United States Biochemical ) . 
PFGE . 
Genomic DNA from a late logarithmic phase S. typhimurium LT2 culture was prepared in InCert agarose ( FMC ) as described ( 17 , 18 ) . 
The DNA was cleaved with 10 units of Bln I ( Takara Biochemical , Berkeley , CA ) or Xba I ( Stratagene ) for 4 hr in 1 x KGB ( 22 ) , with potassium acetate replacing potassium glutamate . 
The fragments were separated using a TAFE system ( Beckman ) and 0.5 x TAE buffer ( 40 mM Tris-acetate/1 mM EDTA ) . 
After electrophoresis , the gel was treated with 0.2 M HCl for 15 min , with denaturation solution ( 0.5 M NaOH/1 .5 M NaCI ) for 30 min , and finally with neutralization buffer ( 0.5 M Tris , pH 7.5 / 2.5 M NaCl ) for 30 min . 
DNA was transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane ( Stratagene ) using 20x SSC ( lx SSC = 0.15 M NaCl/15 mM sodium citrate ) buffer and then UV cross-linked . 
Dot Blot Analysis of Induced Mud-P22 . 
Strains carrying Mud-P22 at different chromosome map locations were induced by mitomycin C as described ( 14 ) . 
Preparation of DNA for the mapping array was largely as described ( 17 ) . 
DNAs were prepared from each induced phage , dot blotted to an 11 x 10 cm Duralon-UV membrane , and UV cross-linked . 
Probe Preparation and Hybridization . 
The 23S rRNA-specific oligonucleotide 5 ' - GGTGTCGACTATGAACCT-GCTTCCCATCGACTAC-3 ' was radiolabeled using [ y-32P ] ATP and polynucleotide kinase ( Stratagene ) and used as a control in Northern blots for quantitation of RNA . 
Hybridizations to RAP blots , PFGE blots , and Northern blots were performed with 2-5 x 108 cpm / . 
ug of [ a-32P ] dCTP-labeled probes that were made using a random priming kit ( Stratagene ) . 
For Southern blotting of RAP fingerprints , DNA was transferred directly from the polyacrylamide gel after rehydration in 20x SSC . 
The DNA was then Southern transferred to a membrane ( Duralon-UV , Stratagene ) by capillary action using 20x SSC buffer and UV cross-linked . 
Blots were prehybridized with 5x SSC , 0.5 % blocking re-agent ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , 0.1 % N-lauroylsarcosine , and 0.02 % SDS at 65 °C for 4 hr . 
Hybridization took place in the same buffer at 70 °C overnight ( 65 °C for Northern blots ) . 
After hybridization , the membranes were washed with 2x SSC / 0.1 % SDS twice at room temperature for 15 min and washed with 0.1 x SSC/0 .1 % SDS at 65 °C for 15 min . 
For the 23S rRNA-specific oligonucleotide , the hybridization and washing temperatures were 370C . 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
RNA Fingerprinting . 
First strand cDNA is synthesized with Moloney reverse transcriptase using an arbitrarily selected primer . 
Primer extension occurs most favorably at better matches and becomes progressively less likely at worse matches . 
The arbitrarily primed first strand cDNA is heat denatured and subjected to arbitrarily primed second strand synthesis using Taq polymerase at low stringency . 
Those products that have the primer sequence at both ends are then PCR amplified at high stringency with simultaneous radiolabeling . 
Products are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography . 
The resulting fingerprint patterns are highly reproducible . 
Each fingerprint yields a pattern of 10 or more clearly visible PCR products . 
At least two concentrations must be used for each RNA sample to control for slight concentration effects . 
The method requires only a few nanograms of total cellular RNA for each primer . 
The RAP products that are differentially amplified between RNA samples generally reflect differential gene expression . 
The relative amounts of an amplified product measured by RAP closely parallel the relative amounts of RNA in the various samples as measured by Northern blots ( 1 , 5 ) . 
Source-specific differences in mRNA abundance revealed b 
RAP are useful for studying differential gene expression and the method is applicable to the detection of transcriptionally regulated RNAs in a wide variety of situations . 
The primers select mRNAs for fingerprinting based partly on how well the primer matches with template . 
Thus , the 10 or more RAP products in each lane are obtained as if they were each picked at random from a hypothetical partly normalized cDNA library and then each used as a probe on Northern blots . 
Some of the RAP products may be derived from the abundant structural RNAs . 
However , because these RNAs are generally not differentially expressed , their presence as unvarying products in the fingerprint does not interfere with the experiment . 
Occasionally , the largest RAP products in the fingerprint are unreliably amplified , so these should be ignored even if they seem to show variation . 
Six fingerprints of RNAs from logarithmically growing bacterial cultures , treated and untreated with H202 , were generated by the RAP strategy using six different 18-base primers ( Materials and Methods ) . 
For each primer there were 10 or more observable bands in each lane but only a few differentially amplified cDNA products were observed . 
Fig. 1 shows an example of fingerprints using RSP and ZF9 primers . 
Examples of differentially amplified products are indicated by arrowheads . 
The differentially amplified RAP products were isolated and cloned in the manner previously described ( 1 ) . 
The clone RSP435 contained a 435-bp cDNA insert ( GenBank accession no . 
U04161 ) derived from RNA isolated from peroxidetreated cells using the RSP primer . 
This product was not visible in the RAP products derived from RNA isolated from untreated cells . 
The longest potential open reading frame extended for 128 amino acids from one end ( excluding the primer sequence ) and terminated 51 bases from the other end of the clone . 
A search of the GenBank data base revealed no significant homology with any previously sequenced DNA or protein . 
One other peroxide-inducible cDNA has been cloned and sequenced ( data not shown ) . 
This clone has homology to the `` U '' tail gene of bacteriophage A and is likely to be derived from the lambdoid prophage Fels-1 ( 17 , 23 , 24 ) . 
This prophage may be induced in some cells by the level of peroxide used in these experiments . 
The gene has not been further characterized . 
To confirm that RSP435 corresponded to the differentially amplified RAP product and that differential amplification was reproducible , a separate fingerprinting experiment using the same primer was performed . 
This fingerprint was transferred onto a Duralon-UV membrane and probed with the clone . 
RSP435 hybridized to a product of 435 bases in the lanes derived from the S. typhimurium LT2 cultures treated with H202 for 30 min and 120 min and did not hybridize in lanes of the fingerprint derived from untreated cultures or from the ( oxyRl ) LT2 TA4100 control H202 control H202 0 0 0 0 0 N 0 N 0 CM ' 0 C 0 CO ) C ' ) 0 C ) O CO

Stress Induction of the RSP435 RNA Shown by Northern Blotting . 
Northern blots were performed to confirm that this differentially amplified RAP product RSP435 represented a differentially expressed RNA ( Fig. 3 ) . 
RNA hybridizing to the RSP435 clone was induced manyfold after 30 min in LT2 but was not induced in an oxyRI mutant . 
This result is consistent with the result obtained by the Southern blot of the RAP fingerprint in Fig. 2 . 
The growth curve for the oxyRi mutant was unaffected by peroxide treatment , whereas the rate of growth of the LT2 wild-type cells was transiently diminished ( data not shown ) . 
The dominant oxyRI mutant constitutively overexpresses at least 9 H202-inducible genes . 
However , at least 21 other peroxide-inducible genes are not expressed ( 12 ) . 
These latter genes are presumably induced by a separate , perhaps more general , stress response . 
RSP435 could be in this class . 
RSP435 is probably not a part of the other known stimulon induced in the macrophage phagosome phoP/phoO , because acidification rather than peroxide is implicated as the intracellular inducer of this regulon ( 25 ) . 
Whether RSP435 responds to other regulators has not yet been investigated . 
Physical Mapping of the Corresponding Gene . 
We further characterized RSP435 by mapping its chromosomal location by means of Southern blots to Bln I and Xba I restriction fragments of the S. typhimurium genome separated by PFGE ( 17 , 18 , 26 ) . 
The gene hybridized at high stringency to two genomic fragments . 
One fragment extended from a Bln I site created by TnJO insertion in the gene gal at 18 min to a naturally occurring site at 21 min , and the other fragment was generated by cleavage at the naturally occurring Bln I sites at 38 and 57 min ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The size of the fragment at 18-21 min is dependent on the presence ( lane 3 ) or absence ( lanes 2 and 3 ) of the 50-kb Fels-1 prophage in the fragment . 
This is discussed in more detail later . 
In Fig. 4 , lane 1 , the clone also hybridized to an 800-kb Xba I fragment from 13-26 min and a 35-kb Xba I fragment that maps to 56-57 min ( 26 ) . 
The places in the genome were hybridization signals from both similar , indicating that the genes are highly homologous . 
We also probed DNA from an induced array of Mud-P22 ( 14 , 15 ) . 
RSP435 hybridized to DNA induced from three Mud-P22 insertions : aroA : : MudP , which packages 42-kb segments clockwise from 19 min ; putA1019 : : MudP , counterclockwise from 21.5 min ; and purG2149 : : MudP , clockwise from 54 mnu ( data not shown ) . 
One copy of the gene and flanking regions has been isolated from a genomic library and shown to be adjacent to pncB at 20 min ( unpublished data ) . 
map near to both of the regions to which RSP435 hybridizes ( ref . 
17 ; K.K.W. , N. Yamamoto , and M.M. ) . 
Genomic DNAs of Fels-1 , Fels-2 lysogenic S. typhimurium , and strains cured ofFels-1 and Fels-2 ( 23 , 24 ) were cleaved with Bln I and Xba I and the fragments were separated by PFGE and then Southern blotted . 
RSP435 still hybridized to strains cured of the prophage , eliminating these prophage as sources of the RSP435 gene ( Fig. 4 , lanes 2-4 ) . 
The regions to which RSP435 homologs mapped do not contain any previously known inducible genes . 
Two tRNA-serine loci that map to similar locations as RSP435 in Esch-erichia coli ( 27 ) have no homology with RSP435 . 
So far , the best candidate loci for RSP435 are the `` leaky '' complementation groups lykA and lykB that map to -20 min and lykC and lykD that map to = 58 min ( 28 ) . 
In summary , an entirely physical strategy for characterizing conditionally expressed genes was employed to identify a stress-inducible gene in a bacterium : RAP , cloning , sequencing , Northern blots , and PFGE . 
Because RAP can identify differentially expressed genes without the need to alter the genome , the disruption of natural physiological responses is not a concern . 
RAP should be ofparticular utility for characterizing conditionally expressed genes in orga-nisms in which genetic methods are difficult or have not been developed .
