Bacterial survival in diverse and changing environments relies on the accurate interplay between different regulatory pathways , which determine the design of an adequate adaptive response . 
The proper outcome depends on a precise gene expression proﬁle generated from the ﬁnely tuned and concerted action of transcriptional factors of distinct regulatory hierarchies . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbors multiple regulatory systems that are crucial for the bacterium to cope with harsh extra - and intracellular environments . 
In this work , we found that the expression of Salmonella RstA , a response regulator from the two-component system family , was able to downregulate the expression of three RpoS-controlled genes ( narZ , spvA , and bapA ) . 
Furthermore , this downregulation was achieved by a reduction in RpoS cellular levels . 
The alternative sigma factor RpoS is critical for bacterial endurance under the most-stressful conditions , including stationary-phase entrance and host adaptation . 
Accordingly , RpoS cellular levels are tightly controlled by complex transcriptional , translational , and posttranslational mechanisms . 
The analysis of each regulatory step revealed that in Salmonella , RstA expression was able to promote RpoS degradation independently of the MviA-ClpXP proteolytic pathway . 
Additionally , we show that RstA is involved in modulating Salmonella bioﬁlm formation . 
The fact that the RpoS-modulated genes affected by RstA expression have previously been demonstrated to contribute to Salmonella pathogenic traits , which include bioﬁlm-forming capacity , suggests that under yet unknown conditions , RstA may function as a control point of RpoS-dependent pathways that govern Salmonella virulence . 
RstA is a member of the OmpR subfamily of two-compo-nent system ( TCS ) response regulators ( RRs ) , characterized by the display of a winged-helix-turn-helix motif in the DNA-binding domain . 
Several lines of evidence demonstrated that in Escherichia coli , the encoding gene , rstA , belongs to the PhoP / PhoQ regulon ( 39 ) showing downregulation of rstAB ( which codes for the putative RstA/RstB TCS putative pair ) in a phoPQ mutant strain and direct PhoP control over rstA expression by a footprinting assay ( 34 ) . 
Yamamoto et al. showed that RstB , the putative RstA-associated histidine kinase , was able to transfer in vitro its phosphoryl group to RstA ( 53 ) , suggesting that in E. coli , RstB and RstA constitute an orthodox TCS regulatory pair . 
Phenotypic screenings , either systematically deleting the genes that code for TCS or overexpressing all RRs , indicated that E. coli rstAB was involved in bacterial resistance to ketoprofen , pridinol , and troleandomycin ( 54 ) and that RstA overexpression conferred low-level - lactam resistance ( 20 ) . 
More recently , it was shown that in E. coli , the transient expression of RpoE ( sigma E ) in stationary phase downregulated rstA and rstB transcription ( 22 ) and that multiple copies of rstA suppressed the lethal phenotype of a deletion in yjeE , encoding an ATPase with undetermined function ( 6 ) .

reported that E. coli RstA upregulated the expression of asr ( acid shock RNA ) but that RstA overexpression repressed csgD ( a regulator of curli ﬁmbriae ) . 
On the other hand , in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , the regulation of rstA by PhoP was shown by bioinformatics analysis ( 55 , 56 ) . 
Intriguingly , in this bacterium , rstA and rstB are separated by 3,585 bp in the chromosome , in contrast to the adjacent localization displayed in E. coli . 
Apart from this knowledge , both the identity of the members of the Salmonella RstA regulon and the physiological relevance of its function remain unclear . 
In this work , we searched for RstA gene targets with the aim of understanding the role of the RstA regulon in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium physiology . 
This screening led us to uncover that RstA was able to downregulate RpoS-dependent genes and that this modulation was achieved by decreasing the intracellular levels of the alternative sigma factor . 
RpoS ( also known as sigma S or sigma 38 ) plays a central role in bacterial adaptation to starvation and countering a variety of stressful conditions , including low pH , heat or cold shock , oxidative damage , hyper - or hypo-osmolarity , and DNA damage ( 19 ) . 
It has also been demonstrated that RpoS plays an essential role in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis : the rpoS mutant displays a decreased ability to colonize murine Peyer 's patches and a severe defect in the systemic phase of the infection ( 11 , 17 , 37 ) . 
The ﬁne-tuning of the cellular concentration of this sigma factor underlies an intricate regulatory network fed by multiple inputs , involving transcriptional , translational , and posttranslational controls ( comprehensively reviewed in reference 19 ) . 
Among the posttranslational processes , RpoS degradation , which maintains the sigma factor at low levels in exponentially growing cells , has been described to be dependent exclusively on the action of the MviA-mediated ClpXP protease complex ( 35 , 36 , 41 , 42 ) . 
The results presented here demonstrate that RstA is able to promote RpoS degradation in Salmonella , downregulating the expression of RpoS-modulated genes and altering bioﬁlm formation . 
The data shown in this work also underscore the existence of an RpoS degradation process that is independent of the MviA-ClpXP proteolytic machinery .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Miller 's Luria broth ( LB ) ( 10 g/liter NaCl , 5 g/liter yeast extract , and 10 g/liter tryptone ) . 
Ampicillin was used at 100 g ml 1 , kanamycin at 50 g ml 1 , chloramphenicol at 10 g ml 1 , and spectinomycin at 100 g ml 1 . 
IPTG ( isopropyl - - D-thioga-lactopyranoside ) was used at 0.5 mM , when indicated . 
Bacterial genetic and molecular biology techniques . 
Phage P22-mediated transductions were performed as described previously ( 15 ) . 
Plasmid DNA was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation using a Bio-Rad apparatus according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
The deletion of various genes and the concomitant insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette were carried out using Lambda Red-mediated recombination ( 14 , 16 ) in strain LB5010 ( 4 ) . 
The mutations resulting from this procedure were transferred to the wild-type ATCC 14028s background by P22 transduction . 
To introduce the lacZ reporter gene , antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed using the temperature-sensi-tive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( 10 ) . 
pCE36 was used to introduce the transcriptional lacZ fusion as previously described ( 16 ) . 
The oligo-nucleotides used to perform these procedures were purchased from Bio-Synthe-sis , Inc. ( Lewisville , TX ) . 
Their sequences are listed in Table 2 . 
- Galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously ( 33 ) . 
Stability assays . 
Overnight , aerated cultures grown in LB were cultured ( 1 : 100 ) in fresh LB medium . 
When cultures reached late exponential phase ( 4.5 h ) , IPTG was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mM in order to induce RstA expression . 
Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for thirty additional minutes . 
Then , spectinomycin was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.0 mg/ml . 
The 0-min sample was taken immediately before the addition of spectinomycin . 
Subsequent samples were taken at the indicated time points ( see Fig. 4 ) . 
One-milliliter aliquots were resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) loading buffer in a volume in milliliters equal to 0.1 optical density unit at 600 nm ( OD600 ) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis . 
Western blot analysis . 
Except for the stability assay samples , 1.0-ml samples were prepared by pelleting whole cells and immediately resuspending them in SDS loading buffer in a volume with an OD600 of 10 . 
After resuspension in loading buffer , all samples from the stability assays and other experiments were treated in the same fashion . 
Equal volumes ( 5.0 l for clp and mviA samples withdrawn from stationary phase and 20 l for the rest of the assays ) were loaded onto 12 % polyacrylamide denaturing gels . 
After electrophoresis , proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-RpoS monoclonal antibody ( Neoclone ) . 
Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G -- horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) was used at a 1:2,500 dilution as a secondary antibody .

ECL antibody detection kit ( GE Healthcare ) . 
In the experiments performed with the clp mutant strains , the exposure time was adjusted to avoid signal saturation . 
Immunoblotting results were scanned densitometrically to produce quantitative determinations . 
The immunoblots shown in the ﬁgures are representative results from at least three independent assays . 
Bioﬁlm assay . 
In order to test different strains for their ability to produce a bioﬁlm , 2.0 l of an overnight culture was used to inoculate 2.0 ml of LB , in borosilicate tubes . 
The cultures were incubated at room temperature in static conditions for 6 days , as described previously ( 27 ) . 
The cultures were removed , and the tubes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline three times . 
After drying the tubes at room temperature , 3.0 ml of crystal violet ( 1 % ) was added for 20 min . 
The stained bioﬁlms were rinsed several times with distilled water and visualized as a colored ring in the air-broth interface . 
In order to quantify the bioﬁlm formation , adhered crystal violet was solubilized by the addition of 3.0 ml of 95 % ethanol and then 3.0 ml of 30 % acetic acid . 
The OD was measured .

RESULTS
Search for RstA-regulated genes . 
With the aim of analyzing the Salmonella RstA regulon , we constructed lacZ reporter fusions to yﬁA , cspC , and entE . 
These genes were among the RstA-activated genes found previously by microarray analysis in E. coli ( 39 ) . 
Surprisingly , we found that the expression of the aforementioned genes was not altered either by expressing RstA from a medium-copy-number , IPTG-inducible plasmid ( pRstA ) or in an rstA deletion mutant ( rstA ) , compared with the wild-type strain ( data not shown ) . 
This result suggested that the Salmonella RstA regulon would not entirely overlap with its counterpart in E. coli . 
Because the RstA-inducing signal was undetermined , we decided to search for Salmonella RstA-regulated genes by screening a random insertional MudJ library in a rstA strain harboring pRstA . 
The screening was carried out in LB -- X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ) replica plates , with or without the addition of IPTG , as described previously ( 44 ) . 
Among the 10,000 mutants screened , we found three MudJ insertions in which lacZ expression was downregulated by RstA . 
A DNA sequence analysis of the regions adjacent to the insertions and a subsequent search of the Salmonella genome database ( 32 ) showed that they were located in narZ , spvA , and STM2689 . 
narZ is the ﬁrst gene of the Salmonella narZYWV operon . 
Spector et al. showed that in S. enterica , narZ was required for carbon-starva-tion-inducible thermotolerance and that it was induced inside epithelial cells , while a narZ deletion raised approximately 10-fold the 50 % lethal dose of the wild-type strain in a mouse virulence assay ( 45 ) . 
spvA is the ﬁrst gene of the spvABCD operon located in the Salmonella virulence plasmid . 
This operon is essential for Salmonella to establish a successful systemic infection , and this phenotype has been ascribed mainly to spvB expression ( 7 , 9 , 18 , 25 ) . 
STM2689 has recently been renamed bapA and codes for a large proline-threonine-rich protein involved in bioﬁlm formation and invasion ( 27 ) . 
It should be mentioned that we found narZ , spvA , and bapA transcriptional levels to be repressed in a strain expressing RstA from pRtsA , while they were unaltered in a rstA mutant , compared to a wild-type background under the growth conditions tested ( Fig. 1 ) . 
These results remained unchanged when tested in an rstB deletion mutant background ( data not shown ) . 
These last ﬁndings suggest that RstA overexpression could functionally mimic the effect generated by the switch of the regulator to an activated state , as it occurs with other two-com-ponent RRs , such as PhoP , UphB , and OmpR ( 13 , 26 , 29 ) .

FIG. 1 . 
The RpoS-dependent genes narZ , spvA , and bapA are downregulated by the expression of RstA . 
- Galactosidase activities from lacZ transcriptional fusions to narZ , spvA , and bapA were measured in the wild type ( W-t ) , the rstA strain , the rstA strains harboring pUHE21-2 lacIq ( vector ) and pUHE21-2 lacIq : : rstA ( pRstA ) , and the otherwise isogenic rpoS background . 
Cells were grown over-night in LB , with the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG when plasmids were present , as indicated . 
The data shown are averages from at least three independent assays performed in duplicate .

RstA modulates RpoS-dependent genes . 
Previous work dem-onstrated that the expression of both narZ and the spv operon was activated by RpoS ( 9 , 24 , 45 ) . 
Using a rpoS isogenic strain , we corroborated that in stationary phase both narZ expression and spvA expression were dependent on the intactness of rpoS ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Moreover , we veriﬁed that bapA expression was also under RpoS control ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In light of these results , we investigated whether RpoS and RstA regulatory pathways were interconnected . 
To assess whether RstA expression was altering the cellular RpoS content , RpoS steady-state levels were measured by immunoblot analysis using stationary phase bacterial cultures ( the growth condition in which RstA-dependent downregulation of the reporter genes was detected ) . 
As shown in Fig. 2A , upon RstA expression , cellular RpoS levels were greatly diminished with respect to the levels found in the wild type or the rstA strains ( i.e. , a 40 % reduction as determined by densitometric analysis ) . 
A quantitatively equivalent expression of a related RR of the two-component family ( PhoP ) or of the unrelated transcriptional MerR-type metalloregulator GolS ( 8 ) did not signiﬁcantly modify RpoS levels ( Fig. 2A , upper panel ) . 
In parallel , an internal control experiment was carried out by developing the Western blot with polyclonal anti-PhoQ antibodies ( Fig. 2A , lower panel ) . 
These results suggest that the observed downregulation of RpoS-dependent genes was due speciﬁcally to an RstA-induced decrease of the cellular levels of the sigma factor . 
Therefore , we determined at which stage of RpoS expression ( transcriptional , translational , or protein stability ) the RstA-mediated effect was taking place . 
First , we generated a chromosomal rpoS-lacZ transcriptional fusion . 
Figure 2B shows that rpoS transcriptional levels remained essentially unaltered either in a rstA strain or in an RstA-expressing strain . 
We also performed the counterpart experiment by assaying an rstA-lacZ transcriptional reporter in either a wild-type or rpoS strain to rule out that rstA transcriptional levels could be inﬂuenced by RpoS ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Next , to investigate whether RstA was acting on rpoS translation , we used an rpoS-lacZ translational reporter ( 9 ) in which the lacZ fusion occurs at codon 177 of rpoS , truncating the essential target motif for RpoS degradation . 
This reporter was previously demonstrated to be a useful tool reﬂecting the sum of transcriptional and translational controls ( 46 , 50 ) . 
Because of the lack of a selectable marker to perform the transduction of this construction to the ATCC 14028s strain , we carried out this set of determinations in the Salmonella enterica strain UK1 original background ( 1 , 12 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 3A , RstA-induced expression was not able to modify rpoS translational levels , simultaneously corroborating that rpoS transcription was unaffected as well . 
Control experiments were performed to test the rpoS177-lacZ fusion in clpP or mviA isogenic backgrounds to verify the inability of the MviA-ClpXP machinery to accomplish the degradation of the corresponding reporter fusion protein , or in a strain harboring a null mutation in hfq , which codes for an RNA chaperone that positively regulates RpoS translation ( 30 ) ( see Fig. 3A ) . 
RstA promotes RpoS degradation in an MviA-ClpXP-inde-pendent manner . 
While active proteolysis maintains RpoS at low levels in exponentially growing cells , RpoS stability increases at the entry into stationary phase and when starvation challenges the bacterial cell ( 19 , 31 ) . 
Two factors are described to be essential for RpoS turnover : the ClpXP protease complex and MviA ( known as RssB in E. coli ) . 
MviA associates with RpoS and delivers the sigma factor to the ClpXP degradation complex ( 35 , 36 , 41 , 42 ) ( compare also cellular RpoS levels in wild-type and clpP or mviA backgrounds [ Fig. 3B ] ) . 
In order to assess whether RstA was triggering this pathway , we compared the effects of RstA expression on RpoS levels in strains carrying a deletion mutation in either clpP or mviA . 
As shown in Fig. 3B , RstA expression was able to lower cellular RpoS levels in both mutant backgrounds ( an average 50 % reduction of RpoS levels , as determined by the densitometric analysis of three independent experiments ) . 
An equivalent effect was observed when samples taken from either exponential or late stationary phase were analyzed ( Fig. 3B , compare the lower and upper panels ) . 
This result clearly indicates that the action of RstA over RpoS was independent of the ClpXP-MviA degradation pathway . 
In a parallel experiment , we determined narZ transcriptional activity in the otherwise wild-type rstA strain compared to that of the clpP or mviA isogenic strains when RstA was expressed . 
We observed that , consistent with the previous result , RstA expression downregulated this RpoS-dependent gene independent of the integrity of the ClpXP/MviA machinery ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Finally , we tested whether the observed downregulation of RpoS was due to RstA-promoted induction of the degradation of the sigma factor . 
With this aim , de novo protein synthesi was halted by the addition of spectinomycin to the bacterial cultures , and RpoS decay in the clp mutant strain harboring either the empty vector or pRstA was followed over time by immunodetection ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . 
As shown in Fig. 4A and B , once translation was stopped , the degradation of preexisting RpoS was estimated to be three times faster in the RstA-expressing strain . 
This last result dem-onstrates that in Salmonella , RstA is able to upregulate RpoS degradation through a pathway distinct from the MviA-ClpXP-dependent one . 
We then examined whether other major cellular proteases present in Salmonella could be involved . 
With this purpose , we generated lon , hslV , and hﬂB deletion mutant strains ( 5 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 4C , none of these deletions affected RstA-in-duced degradation of RpoS . 
In a parallel experiment , we corroborated that the transcriptional activity of narZ was not affected in any of these protease deletion backgrounds ( data not shown ) . 
RstA expression inhibits bioﬁlm formation . 
The production of thin aggregative ﬁmbriae , together with cellulose , capsule , extracellular polysaccharides , and BapA , has been demonstrated to form a matrix that contributes to Salmonella bioﬁlm development ( 27 , 52 ) . 
We showed that RstA downregulate bapA expression ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Moreover , it was previously demonstrated that RpoS induces the expression of AgfD ( known also as CsgD ) , a LuxR-type regulator that controls the expression of all the aforementioned factors ( 27 , 52 ) . 
Therefore , we examined whether RstA expression affected bioﬁlm formation . 
As shown in Fig. 5 , expression of RstA diminishes the bioﬁlm formation visualized by crystal violet staining of the ring that remained ﬁrmly adhered to the culture tubes ( upper panel ) or by quantiﬁcation of the solubilized stain ( lower panel ) . 
Accordingly , a moderate but consistent increase in the adhered bioﬁlm was detected in the rstA strain compared to the wildtype strain . 
As expected , no detectable bioﬁlm formation was observed in the rpoS strain . 
These results suggest the possibility that rstA is involved in a regulatory pathway that controls the Salmonella bioﬁlm differentiation process . 
FIG. 2 .

DISCUSSION
With the aim of deciphering the role of the RstA regulon in Salmonella , we undertook a genetic screening in search of RstA-regulated genes . 
In this approach , we assumed that the induced expression of the RR from a medium-copy-number plasmid circumvented the need for activation by the associated sensor protein -- as we demonstrated to be the case for the homologous PhoP transcriptional regulator ( 29 ) -- or by other possible phosphodonors , such as acetyl phosphate ( 23 , 49 ) . 
The ﬁrst round of screening pinpointed three genes as targets of RstA downregulation : narZ , spvA , and bapA . 
Remarkably , these genes were demonstrated to be transcriptionally controlled by RpoS ( 24 , 27 , 46 ) ( see Fig. 1 ) . 
Having also veriﬁed that RstA expression is not RpoS dependent , we hypothesized that RstA could be able to modulate intracellular RpoS levels . 
RpoS , the stationary-phase alternative sigma factor , has a large impact on the ability of enteric and nonenteric gramnegative bacteria to cope with adverse conditions , such as nutrient starvation , medium acidiﬁcation , and peroxide resistance ( 19 ) , by remodeling the expression pattern of more than 
100 genes ( 21 , 40 , 48 , 51 ) . 
Accordingly , diverse regulatory factors , from transcriptional ones to small RNAs , proteases ( 19 ) , antiadaptor proteins ( 3 ) , and even other alternative sigma factors ( 2 ) , are involved in the complex control of the cellular RpoS content . 
Here we demonstrated that RstA expression lowered steady-state RpoS levels and that this effect was not associated with a general stress effect promoted by protein overexpression but was due speciﬁcally to the expression of RstA ( see Fig. 2A ) . 
To deﬁne where the regulatory action of RstA was occurring , we sequentially focused on each regulatory stage that determines RpoS expression . 
We showed that RstA expression had no impact on either RpoS transcription or translation by monitoring the expression of a transcriptional fusion that disrupts the RpoS region that is essential for MviA interaction ( 46 ) . 
It has been largely demonstrated that the RpoS degradation pathway , active mostly to maintain low levels of the sigma factor when bacteria are growing in exponential phase , depends on the sequential recognition of RpoS by MviA ( named also SprE or RssB in E. coli ) , which delivers it to the ClpXP proteolytic complex . 
We therefore asked whether RstA was stimulating this cascade or , alternatively , it could conceivably replace MviA in the function of delivery to the protease complex . 
By assessing the RpoS levels in clpP and mviA deletion mutants , we showed that the RstA ability to downregulate RpoS expression was independent of this degradation pathway , regardless of the growth phase . 
This result was substantiated by showing that RstA-mediated repression of the identiﬁed target genes also remained MviA-ClpXP independent . 
We also demonstrated that apart from ClpXP , none of the other major cellular proteases , i.e. , Lon , HslUV , or HﬂB , are responsible for the RstA-induced degradation of RpoS . 
Finally , RpoS degradation was monitored after blocking de novo protein synthesis while inducing RstA expression . 
This experiment established that in Salmonella , RstA is able to promote RpoS turnover , activating its degradation in a ClpXP-MviA-independent manner . 
This last result uncovered clearly the existence of a yet unknown RpoS degradation mechanism triggered by the two-component RR RstA . 
Further work will be required to elucidate the mechanism by which RstA promotes RpoS degradation . 
We foresee several potential alternatives : ( i ) RstA induces the expression of a gene ( s ) that encodes an unknown protease ( or protease complex ) involved in RpoS turnover , ( ii ) RstA itself chaperones RpoS to a degradation apparatus different from ClpXP , or ( iii ) RstA directly or indirectly counteracts the effect of a factor that protects RpoS from proteolysis . 
It was demonstrated previously that rstA is transcriptionally induced in extracellular Mg2 limitation ( a PhoP/PhoQ sys-tem-inducing condition ) . 
However , this stimulus was insufﬁcient to promote RstA-dependent modulation of narZ , spvA , or bapA ( data not shown ) . 
With this ﬁnding and the fact that identical results were obtained when the assays shown in this work were done in an rstB background , it becomes apparent that an additional and yet unidentiﬁed signal is required to trigger the switch of RstA to an activated state , which in our experiments is bypassed by RstA-induced expression . 
That the RstA-activating signal is not present in the culture conditions used ( LB medium , vigorous shaking , 37 °C ) would also explain the lack of signiﬁcant differences detected between the wild type and the rstA strains in the modulation of RpoS level and , in consequence , in the transcriptional activity of the RpoS-dependent genes . 
Interestingly , Tu et al. recently showed that IraP , a small protein under the transcriptional control of PhoP , stabilizes RpoS by preventing MviA binding , thus blocking ClpXP-me-diated degradation ( 47 ) . 
Because PhoP upregulates both rstA and iraP transcription , we can predict that in an environment where not only PhoP - but also RstA-activating signals are simultaneously present , cellular RpoS levels will be ﬁnely adjusted by the opposing effects of the two circuits . 
Finally , bioﬁlm formation was enhanced in the rstA strain , while it was repressed in the RstA-expressing bacteria , compared to the wild-type strain . 
Because we were able to detect a differential phenotype between the wild type and the rstA strains when bioﬁlm was developed , we can speculate that the assay conditions that promote multicellular behavior in Salmo-nella ( i.e. , static growth over an extended period of time and cell-cell and cell-abiotic surface contacts ) would generate a signal which physiologically modulates RstA activity . 
RstA-dependent regulation of bioﬁlm was not unexpected in light of the RstA-dependent modulation of cellular RpoS levels and the knowledge that this sigma factor stimulates AgfD expression . 
This regulator controls the production of essential constituents of the extracellular matrix that leads to bioﬁlm development . 
Indeed , the recent work of Ogasawara et al. ( 38 ) revealed that in E. coli , overexpression of RstA downregulates csgD ( agfD in Salmonella ) expression by direct binding to its promoter region . 
As a result , and because also exhibits agfD the described RstA-binding motif ( as determined by our visual inspection of the agfD promoter region ) , RstA would display a double control over Salmonella bioﬁlm formation , simultaneously repressing the two master regulatory factors , RpoS and AgfD .
