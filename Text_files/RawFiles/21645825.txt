Article history : 
Minimally processed vegetables ( MPV ) may be important vehicles of Salmonella spp . 
and cause disease . 
This study aimed at detecting and enumerating Salmonella spp . 
in MPV marketed in the city of São Paulo , Brazil . 
A total of 512 samples of MPV packages collected in retail stores were tested for Salmonella spp . 
and total coliforms and Escherichia coli as indication of the hygienic status . 
Salmonella spp . 
was detected in four samples , two using the detection method and two using the counting method , where the results were 8.8 102 CFU/g and 2.4 102 CFU/g . 
The serovars were Salmonella Typhimurium ( three samples ) and Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica O :47 : z4 , z23 : - ( one sample ) . 
Fourteen samples ( 2.7 % ) presented counts of E. coli above the maximum limit established by the Brazilian regulation for MPV ( 102 CFU/g ) . 
Therefore , tightened surveillance and effective intervention strategies are necessary in order to address consumers and governments concerns on safety of MPV .

1. Introduction
Minimally processed vegetables ( MPV ) are those submitted to simple operations ( slicing or shredding and disinfection ) , aiming to preserve their freshness , nutritional quality and sensorial properties ( Cruz et al. , 2006 ) . 
It is expected that in addition to health aspects , minimal processing addresses consumers ' expectations for safe foods that are easy to use ( Jacxsens et al. , 2010 ) . 
The augmented demand and consumption of MPV and their increased association with foodborne disease outbreaks intensify the concerns with the safety of these products ( Olsen et al. , 2000 ; Little et al. , 2003 ; Little and Gillespie , 2008 ) . 
Careful management of process hygiene is crucial to avoid the presence of microbial hazards since minimal processing is not an end-point preservation treatment . 
In this sense , the use of indicator microorganisms such as Escherichia coli has been used to indicate the hygiene during processing ( Little and Gillespie , 2008 ) . 
Salmonella is the leading cause of foodborne diseases worldwide ( Greig and Ravel , 2009 ) . 
Although the majority of outbreaks in which Salmonella spp . 
is the etiological agent are linked with ingestion of contaminated foods of animal origin ( Greig and Ravel , 2009 ; Oliveira et al. , 2010 ) , the association with vegetables has been

increasing in the last few years ( WHO , 2008 ; Little and Gillespie , 2008 ; Lynch et al. , 2009 ) . 
The pathogen is a major challenge for the microbiological safety of MPV ( Olsen et al. , 2000 ; Krtinic et al. , 2010 ) , and has been found in several types of vegetables in Brazil and other countries ( Fröder et al. , 2007 ; Abadias et al. , 2008 ; Meldrum et al. , 2009 ; Giusti et al. , 2010 ) . 
Despite the fact that the prevalence of Salmonella spp . 
in fresh vegetables may be as high as 35 % ( FDA , 2001 ) and that outbreaks due to this pathogenefood combination are quite frequent ( Harris et al. , 2003 ) , to our knowledge no study reported counts of Salmonella spp . 
in MPV . 
Thus , this study aimed at detecting and enumerating Salmonella spp . 
in MPV available in retail stores in São Paulo , Brazil . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Collection of MPV samples
A total of 512 samples of MPV packages were purchased from retail stores of the ﬁve largest Brazilian supermarket chains in the city of São Paulo , Brazil . 
The samples belonged to the six most popular brands available in the market and only packages within expiration date stated in the label were collected . 
Each sample belonged to a different lot of production and contained vegetables grown in Brazil . 
MPV containing lettuce , carrot , collard green and cabbage were prioritized since these are the most consumed vegetables in Brazil ( IBGE , 2007 ) . 
All vegetables had been submitted to a sanitization step during processing and thu

considered ready-to-eat . 
The list of MPV types and the number of samples are shown in Table 1 . 
2.2. Microbiological analysis
After purchasing , MPV samples were kept under refrigeration ( 4e7 C ) and analyzed within 24 h. Before testing , MPV packages were disinfected with 70 % alcohol solution , opened under aseptic conditions and the vegetables analyzed for prevalence and enumeration of Salmonella spp . 
and counts of hygiene indicators ( total coliforms and E. coli ) . 
Prevalence of Salmonella spp . 
was determined according to ISO 6579 ( Anonymous , 2002 ) . 
Brieﬂy , 25 g of each sample were homogenized with 225 mL buffered peptone water ( BPW ) and incubated for 37 1 C for 18 2 h , followed by selective enrichment in Rappaport Vassiliadis soya peptone broth ( RVS ) ( 41.5 1 C for 24 3 h ) and MullereKauffmann tetrathionate/novobiocin ( MKTTn ) broth ( 37 1 C for 24 3 h ) . 
Both broths were then plated on XLD - and Bismuth sulﬁde-agars and incubated at 37 1 C for 24 3 h. All culture media were from Merck ( Darmstadt , Germany ) , except otherwise stated . 
For enumeration of Salmonella spp. , the sample homogenate used for testing the presence of Salmonella spp . 
( 10 1 ) was plated in three different plates of XLD agar ( portions of 0.3 , 0.3 and 0.4 mL ) . 
Further decimal serial dilutions were prepared in 0.1 % peptone water and aliquots of 0.1 mL were spread onto XLD agar plates , and incubated at 37 1 C for 24 3 h. Presumptive colonies in XLD and/or BS plates ( ﬁve per plate in the case of enumeration ) were then transferred to Nutrient Agar plates ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) , incubated at 37 1 C for 24 3 h and then submitted to tests for fermentation of glucose , hydrolysis of urea , decarboxylation of lysine , production of b-galactosidase , production of acetoin ( VogeseProskauer test ) and indol , as recommended by ISO 6579 ( Anonymous , 2002 ) . 
Colonies were also submitted to agglutination reaction using Salmonella polyvalent antisera ( Probac , São Paulo , Brazil ) . 
Final conﬁrmation was carried out using API20E ( Biomerieux , Marcy l'Etoile , France ) and PCR reaction , using primers ST 11 ( AGC CAA CCA TTG CTA AAT TGG CGC A ) and ST 15 ( GGT AGA AAT TCC CAG CGG GTA CTG ) selected from a Salmonella-speciﬁc fragment , JEO402-1 ( Aabo et al. , 1993 ) to amplify the 429 bp fragment speciﬁc for this microorganism . 
PCR tests were performed as described by Myint et al. ( 2006 ) , and Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076 and ultrapure water were used as positive and negative controls , respectively . 
Results were expressed as absence or presence of Salmonella spp . 
per 25 g ( prevalence ) or as CFU/g ( enumeration ) . 
Only colonies conﬁrmed as Salmonella spp . 
by biochemical and genetic tests simultaneously were considered to be positive for this pathogen . 
Conﬁdence intervals ( 95 % CI ) for the prevalence of Salmonella spp . 
were estimated based on cumulative binomial distribution . 
Sero-typing of Salmonella spp . 
isolates based on O - and H-group antigens was carried out in the National Center for Salmonella Serotyping in Fundação Oswaldo Cruz , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . 
The enumeration of total coliforms and E. coli was carried out using Petriﬁlm EC ( 3M , Saint Paul , USA ) , following the manufacturers ' instructions . 
3. Results and discussion
Out of 512 packages of MPV tested in this study , four were Salmonella spp . 
positive . 
Two ( 0.4 % , with 95 % CI 0.05 e1 .4 % ) were positive in the prevalence study , and another two ( 0.4 % ) presented countable levels of this pathogen . 
In the prevalence study , Salmonella was detected in one pack of lettuce and arugula , and the serovars were Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica O :47 : z4 , z23 : - , respectively . 
In the enumeration study , organic lettuce and mix of leafy vegetables ( escarole and chicory ) presented counts of the microorganism ( 8.8 102 CFU/g and 2.4 102 CFU/g , respectively ) and both isolates belonged to serovar S. Typhimurium . 
According to both Brazilian and international regulations ( Brasil , 2001 ; Gilbert et al. , 2000 ) , the presence of Salmonella in ready-to-eat vegetables is unacceptable ( absence/25 g ) and may represent a risk for MPV consumers . 
Low prevalence of Salmonella in MPV as found in the present study has been reported by other authors in Brazil ( Fröder et al. , 2007 ) , and in other countries as well ( Abadias et al. , 2008 ; Meldrum et al. , 2009 ; Giusti et al. , 2010 ) . 
The prevalence of serovar S. Typhimurium is in agreement with data that show this serovar is one of the most common in humans or foods in Brazil ( Geimba et al. , 2004 ; Fernandes et al. , 2006 ; Mürmann et al. , 2008 ; Duarte et al. , 2009 ) . 
In the period of this study , to the best of our knowledge neither cases of infection nor outbreaks linking consumption of MPV and Salmonella spp . 
have been reported in the State of São Paulo , Brazil . 
It is known that a dose in the range of 102e103 cells of Salmonella spp . 
may cause disease in humans ( Blaser and Newman , 1982 ; Musher and Musher , 2004 ) , with higher attack rates and severity resulting from higher doses in most of cases ( Mintz et al. , 1994 ; Hennessy et al. , 1996 ) . 
Although the counts of Salmonella found in some samples of MPV collected in this study could be enough to result in infection by this microorganism , several factors must be considered that affect the probability of infection by foodborne pathogens . 
One must consider that characteristics of the host , pathogen , food matrix and environment also play an important role in the probability of infection ( Coleman and Marks , 1998 ) . 
In addition , the heterogenic distribution of microorganisms in foods and their fate during commercialization and consumption steps will also inﬂuence the probability of occurrence of infection . 
The populations of total coliforms in the tested MPV samples were above 104 CFU/g in 56 % of the samples ( Table 2 ) . 
E. coli was also detected , but only 14 ( 2.7 % ) samples surpassed the limit of 102 CFU/g established by the Brazilian Surveillance Agency ( ANVISA ) for ready-to-eat vegetables ( Brasil , 2001 ) . 
These results indicate that the samples tested in this study presented better hygienic conditions that those reported in other studies in Brazil ( Fröder et al. , 2007 ) or in other countries ( Abadias et al. , 2008 ; Meldrum et al. , 2009 ; Giusti et al. , 2010 ) . 
Interestingly , the counts of E. coli in the four MPV samples harboring Salmonella spp . 
were below 102 CFU/g , indicating that the use of this microorganism as surrogate for Salmonella in MPV is of little use 
Table 1 
The ﬁndings reported in this study show that tightened surveillance and effective intervention strategies are necessary in order to address consumers and governments concerns on safety of MPV .
