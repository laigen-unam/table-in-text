Abstract 
Porcine carcasses contaminated with Salmonella typhimurium pose signiﬁcant public health problems . 
Prolonged faecal shedding of Salmonella in pigs contributes to the contamination level of carcasses . 
Although the mechanism of prolonged faecal shedding is not yet clariﬁed , the CS54 Island , and more speciﬁcally the shdA gene encoding a ﬁbronectin binding autotransporter protein , was identiﬁed as an important locus for intestinal colonization and persistence of Salmonella typhimurium in mice . 
The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of ShdA in faecal shedding of Salmonella typhimurium in pigs . 
Pigs were orally inoculated with a Salmonella typhimurium wild type ﬁeld strain or its isogenic shdA mutant strain . 
For the ﬁrst few days after inoculation , the shdA mutant strain was excreted more , the diarrhoea was more pronounced and higher numbers of internal organs were infected . 
No effect on long-term shedding was found . 
In a porcine ileal loop model , the wild type strain and shdA mutant strain did not show any differences in the induction of neutrophil inﬂux into the intestinal wall and lumen . 
In conclusion , we have shown that a Salmonella typhimurium deletion mutant in shdA is more virulent during the ﬁrst days after inoculation and is not signiﬁcantly impaired in persistence or prolonged shedding in pigs .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium ( Salmonella typhimurium ) is an important zoonotic agent . 
The prolonged excretion of 
Salmonella typhimurium in pig faeces is a major risk factor both for human and animal health ( Berends et al. , 1997 ; Beloeil et al. , 2004 ) . 
It has been estimated that 5 -- 30 % of ﬁnisher pigs originally infected may still excrete Salmonella at the end of the ﬁnishing period , and this percentage can double in periods of stress , for example during transport and lairage ( Berends et al. , 1996 ) . 
The mechanisms leading to the carrier state or to prolonged faecal shedding in pigs are unknown . 
The CS54 Island has been characterized as an important locus for intestinal colonization and prolonged shedding in mice ( Kingsley et al. , 2000 , 2003 ) . 
The most important component of this island is ShdA , an outer membrane protein of the autotransporter family , which is expressed solely in the intestine . 
Its passenger domain mediates adhesion to ﬁbronectin possibly through a heparin-mimicking binding ( Kingsley et al. , 2002 , 2004 ) . 
Fibronectin binding proteins are common in bacterial pathogens and mainly in Gram positive bacteria . 
Although their speciﬁc role in pathogenesis is not always known , they frequently mediate adherence and entry into mammalian cells ( Joh et al. , 1999 ; Schwarz-Linek et al. , 2004 ) . 
A sandwich model has been proposed in which ﬁbronectin acts as a molecular bridge between the ﬁbronectin binding proteins on the pathogen and the integrins on the host cells ( Joh et al. , 1999 ; Menzies , 2003 ) . 
Kingsley et al. ( 2002 ) demonstrated that a Salmonella typhimurium strain harbouring a mutation in shdA was shed in reduced numbers and for a shorter period of time in the faeces of mice compared to its isogenic parent strain . 
Although these studies are of great value , they were exclusively conducted in mice and the role of ShdA in the pathogenesis of salmonellosis in other animal species was not investigated . 
It was , therefore , the purpose of the present studies to determine the role of this ﬁbronectin binding protein in the persistence and shedding of Salmonella typhimurium in the pig .

2. Materials and methods
ved by the ethical eterinary Medicine , 
All experiments were appro committee of the Faculty of V Ghent University . 
2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium ( Salmonella typhimurium ) strain 112910a phage type 120/ad , was isolated from a pig stool sample and was used as the wild type strain . 
The shdA deletion mutant was constructed in this strain . 
The inocula for the intestinal loop model were prepared as follows . 
Cultures in LB medium were shaken at 130 rpm for 18 h at 25 8C . 
After diluting two-fold with fresh LB , the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 8C , while shaking at 130 rpm . 
Afterwards , three syringes of 5 ml were ﬁlled with cultures of each strain . 
The actual number of bacteria ml was 1 assessed by plating serial dilutions on McConkey agar ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) plates . 
For the oral inoculation of pigs , the bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion broth ( BHI ; Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) for 6 h at 37 8C . 
The bacteria were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS , 2000 g for 10 min at 4 8C ) . 
After a third wash with sterile Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) with Ca / Mg ( Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , Scot-2 + 2 + land ) , the bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml HBSS with Ca / Mg . 
The number of viable Salmonella 2 + 2 + bacteria ml was determined by plating 10-fold 1 dilutions on Brilliant Green Agar ( BGA ; Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) . 
2.2. Construction of a non-polar shdA deletion mutant
The deletion mutant in shdA was constructed according to the one-step inactivation method ﬁrst described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) and slightly modiﬁed for use in Salmonella as described before ( Boyen et al. , 2006 ) . 
Primers were designed using the nucleotide sequence with accession number AE008813 . 
The primers shdA-P1 50-aaagggaaatt-taaaaattgaacaggacttacagtattgtctggagcgcctgtgtaggctg - gagctgcttc-30 ( primer homologous with sequence upstream of ATG start codon ) and shdA-P2 50-tgtcattcgcctcaaaacgggcagggaacacccgcccggttttgtctaac - catatgaatatcctccttag-30 ( primer homologous with sequence downstream of stop codon ) were constructed . 
These primers and the plasmid pKD4 DNA were utilized to amplify the linear fragment , containing the antibiotic resistance gene kan , that was used for the substitution of the gene . 
The helper plasmid pKD46 , encoding the l Red recombinase , was introduced into Salmonella by electroporation , followed by selection on LB agar supplemented with 100 mg carbenicillin l ( Duchefa Biochemie , Haar-1 lem , The Netherlands ) . 
Substitutions of the genes by a kanamycin resistance gene were obtained by electro poration of competent Salmonella ( pKD46 ) cells , cultured in presence of 0.2 % ( w/v ) arabinose , with the linear PCR fragment and selection on LB medium containing 100 mg kanamycin l ( Duchefa Bio-1 chemie , Haarlem , The Netherlands ) . 
This was transduced in a fresh wild type background using bacteriophage P22HTint ( Schmieger and Backhaus , 1976 ) . 
Finally , using the helper plasmid pCP20 , shdA was deleted from the start codon till the stop codon . 
A scar of 83 bp was left in the resulting strain 112910aDshdA . 
This was conﬁrmed by sequencing the relevant PCR fragment . 
At different stages of the construction , bacteriophage P22 sensitivity was tested to conﬁrm the smooth phenotype . 
Two primer pairs were designed : one internal primer pair to conﬁrm the presence of the shdA gene , as used in a previous study ( Pasmans et al. , 2003 ) , and a second primer pair located outside the shdA gene , to conﬁrm the substitution and the deletion . 
2.3. Experimental infection of pigs
Experimental infections were performed in 4-week-old piglets ( commercial closed line based on Landrace ) , that were originating from a serologically negative breeding herd and were negative for Salmonella at faecal sampling . 
They were divided at random into 3 groups : 2 groups of 10 pigs and one negative control group of 6 pigs . 
All three groups were housed in separate isolation units at 25 8C under natural day -- night rhythm with ad libitum access to feed and water . 
Pigs were penned in pairs for the ﬁrst 5 days and individually for the remainder of the experiment . 
The animals were orally inoculated with 10 cfu of 7 Salmonella typhimurium in 2 ml HBSS . 
Group 1 was inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium 112910a , group 2 was inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium 112910aDshdA and group 3 , the negative control group , was sham-inoculated with 2 ml PBS . 
For the ﬁrst 2 days post-inoculation ( pi ) the rectal temperature was measured twice a day and the clinical condition of the pigs was monitored ( anorexia , lethargy , diarrhoea ) . 
From day 3 till day 7 pi this was performed once a day , and subsequently once every other day until day 28 pi . 
Fresh faecal samples were taken from each pig on days 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 and 28 pi for bacteriological analysis . 
On day 5 and day 28 pi 5 pigs of each Salmonella inoculated group and 3 control pigs were euthanized . 
Samples of tonsils , mandibular lymph nodes , bron-chial lymph nodes , lung , heart , liver , spleen , kidney , ileocaecal lymph nodes , jejunum , ileum , caecum and contents of jejunum , ileum and caecum were taken for bacteriological analysis . 
All samples were stored at 70 8C until use . 
The samples were thawed and weighed , 10 % ( w/v ) suspensions were made in buffered peptone water ( BPW ; Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) after which the material was homogenized with a stomacher . 
The homogenized samples were examined for the presence of the Salmonella strains by plating 10-fold dilutions on BGA . 
If negative at direct plating , the samples were pre-enriched overnight in BPWat 37 8C , enriched overnight at 37 8C in tetrathionate broth and then plated on BGA . 
Samples that were negative after direct plating but positive after enrichment , were presumed to contain 10 cfu g . 
Samples that remained negative were 1 presumed to have 0 cfu g . 
Salmonella colonies 1 isolated from each group were analyzed for the presence or absence of the shdA gene by means of PCR to exclude cross contamination between groups . 
Statistical analysis was performed using a nonparametric Kruskal -- Wallis test . 
Differences with a pvalue 0.05 were considered as signiﬁcant . 
2.4. Intestinal loop model
The intestinal loop model was performed on 6-week-old farm-reared Landrace/Large White cross male piglets . 
This model has been described in detail elsewhere ( Wallis et al. , 1995 ) . 
In short , commencing at the distal ileum , a maximum of 30 sequential loops ( each 6 -- 7 cm in length and containing both absorptive epithelium and follicle associated epithelium ) were ligated , separated by 1 cm spacers . 
The lumen of the ileum was gently ﬂushed with 0.9 % NaCl before the construction of the loops to remove the intestinal contents . 
The inoculum injected into each loop , consisting of Salmonella typhimurium 112910a and Salmonella typhimurium 112910aDshdA , respectively , was in the range 1 -- 2 10 cfu . 
Approximately 9 10 ml of blood was removed from the piglets to isolate the polymorphonuclear leucocytes ( PMNs ) . 
The isolated PMNs were labelled with Indium and 111 intestinal wall and in the lumen of the gut , as assessed by the counts per minute ( c.p.m. ) emitted from 111 Indium-labelled PMNs within each loop , was recorded 12 h after injection of the loops using a Wallac 1275 mini gamma counter . 
The data were analyzed using a paired t-test , with the SPSS 12.0 software for Windows . 
A p-value 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant .

3. Results
The course of infection of the piglets inoculated with the wild type strain was similar to several preliminary experiments . 
Sham-inoculated control piglets did not develop disease signs and Salmonella was not isolated from any of the samples taken from these animals throughout the experiment . 
3.1. shdA mutant strain is more virulent early after inoculation
During the ﬁrst days after oral inoculation of the piglets , the shdA mutant strain was shed in higher numbers than the wild type strain ( Fig. 1 ) . 
On days 1 and 2 pi , the difference between the wild type strain and the shdA mutant strain was signiﬁcant ( p 0.05 ) . 
In accordance with the excretion data , diarrhoea in the group of piglets inoculated with the shdA mutant strain was more pronounced ( Table 1 ) . 
At day 5 , the number of respectively . 
A signiﬁcant ( p 0.05 ) higher mean faecal score of the 112910aDshdA strain is indicated with a `` * '' . 
The number of clinically affected piglets in relation to the total number of piglets during the ﬁrst 5 days after inoculation with either the wild type strain or the shdA mutant strain are shown 
Days pi Wild type strain shdA mutant strain infected internal organs ( bronchial lymph nodes , lung , heart , liver , spleen and kidney ) of the piglets inoculated with the shdA mutant strain ( 21/30 ) was higher than the number of infected internal organs of the piglets inoculated with the wild type strain ( 10/30 ) , even though the average number of cfu per gram tissue was not signiﬁcantly different ( Table 2 ) . 
The post-mortem bacteriological results are summarized in Table 2 . 
One piglet inoculated with the shdA mutant strain died suddenly at day 4 pi . 
The internal organs were massively infected ( > 10 cfu g tissue ) with Salmonella .

3.2. shdA mutant strain is not impaired in long- term colonization
From day 8 until day 28 , no signiﬁcant differences in mean faecal shedding were noticed between piglets inoculated with the mutant and wild type strain ( Fig. 1 ) . 
From day 18 on , all animals of both groups shed Salmonella intermittently at enrichment levels . 
At day 28 , all animals of both groups were positive for Salmonella in the ileum and caecum and only the tonsils were colonized in signiﬁcantly higher numbers in the piglets inoculated with the shdA mutant strain . 
The post-mortem bacteriological results are summar-ized in Table 2 . 
3.3. shdA mutant does not induce an increased neutrophil inﬂux in the gut
In the loop assays , infections with the wild type strain and the shdA mutant strain both resulted in enteritis 12 h after inoculation . 
The loops contained a rather small amount of slimy , pus-like substance , which made it impossible to quantify the ﬂuid accumulation in the lumen . 
The shdA mutant strain did not show any signiﬁcant differences in th induction of neutrophil inﬂux in the intestinal wall or in the lumen of the gut compared to its isogenic wild type strain , 12 h after inoculation ( Fig. 2 ) .

4. Discussion
The increased faecal excretion levels during the ﬁrst few days after inoculation of the piglets inoculated with the shdA mutant strain are consistent with the results of Kingsley et al. ( 2003 ) , who reported a three-fold increase in excretion of the shdA mutant strain at day 5 after inoculation of CBA/J mice with an equal mixture of the wild type strain and the shdA mutant strain . 
Although Kingsley et al. ( 2000 , 2003 ) found a reduction in excretion of the shdA mutant strain in comparison with its isogenic wild type strain by 15 days after inoculation of CBA/J mice , we did not observe any signs of decreased shedding of the shdA mutant strain until the end of the experiment ( 28 days pi ) . 
It is becoming more and more obvious tha the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections and the importance of some virulence factors are strongly host-related ( Pasmans et al. , 2003 ; Morgan et al. , 2004 ) . 
As a consequence , the extrapolation of results from pathogenesis studies in one host species to another host is not always possible . 
In this respect , it might be possible that ShdA has a different role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella typhimurium infections in porcine and murine hosts . 
It must be stated , however , that the experiments of Kingsley and coworkers were conducted in a competitive infection model . 
This type of infection model is capable of detecting small differences in colonization capacities between strains because the rather large variation between animals is overcome by considering the ratio of the 2 strains in 1 animal . 
The disadvantage of this model is , however , that no conclusions can be drawn concerning the development of disease or diarrhoea . 
Since mice do not develop an acute intestinal phase of infection , this was not a determining factor for choosing the single infection model for the work in mice . 
In pigs , the intestinal phase of Salmonella infections is deﬁnitely important . 
Although it was found that ﬁbronectin could play an important role in the invasion of Salmonella in epithelial cells ( Walia et al. , 2004 ) , the shdA gene is expressed solely in the gut and it has not been proven to be induced by any in vitro condition ( Kingsley et al. , 2002 ) . 
Therefore , it was impossible to use a relevant in vitro model to investigate the role of ShdA in the invasion of porcine epithelial intestinal cells . 
Although still speculative , altered interactions with the epithelium of the gut could explain the increased colonization capacity of the shdA mutant strain in the early phase of infection . 
Moreover , loss of ﬁbronectin binding proteins has led to an increased virulence in various other bacteria ( McElroy et al. , 2002 ; Nyberg et al. , 2004 ) . 
In summary , we have shown that a Salmonella typhimurium shdA deletion mutant is not signiﬁcantly impaired in persistence in pigs in a single infection model . 
It is excreted in higher numbers during the ﬁrst days after inoculation , possibly because of altered interactions with the intestinal epithelial cells . 
The role of ﬁbronectin as adherence factor , as non-speciﬁc host defense factor or as important modulating factor in inﬂammatory processes remains an intriguing ﬁeld of research in host-pathogen interactions .
