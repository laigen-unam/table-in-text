Static broth culture favors Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium to produce type 1 ﬁmbriae , while solid agar inhibits its expression . 
A transposon inserted in stbC , which would encode an usher for Stb ﬁmbriae of a non-ﬂagellar Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 strain , conferred it to agglutinate yeast cells on both cultures . 
RT-PCR revealed that the expression of the ﬁmbrial subunit gene ﬁmA , and ﬁmZ , a regulatory gene of ﬁmA , were both increased in the stbC mutant when grown on LB agar ; ﬁmW , a repressor gene of ﬁmA , exhibited lower expression . 
Flagella were observed in the stbC mutant and this phenotype was correlated with the motile phenotype . 
Microarray data and RT-PCR indicated that the expression of three genes , motA , motB , and cheM , was enhanced in the stbC mutant . 
The stbC mutant was resistant to several antibiotics , consistent with the ﬁnding that expression of yhcQ and ramA was enhanced . 
A complementation test revealed that transforming a recombinant plasmid possessing the stbC restored the mannose-sensitive agglutination phenotype to the stbC mutant much as that in the parental Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 strain , indicating the possibility of an interplay of different ﬁmbrial systems in coordinating their expression . 
1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica contains more than 2,300 serovars ; one of these , Typhimurium , is an important cause of gastroenteritis [ 1 ] . 
The ability to adhere to the host epithelial cell is considered a prerequisite step for infection . 
Fimbriae , proteinaceous hair-like appendages on the outer membrane of bacteria , have been implicated in such adherence . 
Many types of ﬁmbriae have been described for Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium , among which type 1 ﬁmbriae is the most common ; therefore , type 1 ﬁmbriae are also referred to as common ﬁmbriae [ 2 ] . 
Type 1 ﬁmbriae adhere to a variety of cells , including erythrocytes , leukocytes , intestinal cells , and even plant root hairs . 
More than 80 % of Salmonella species isolates produce type 1 ﬁmbriae , and this ﬁmbrial type may play some role in the life cycle of bacteria [ 3 ] . 
Old et al. described the phenotypic variation of the expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae in Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 4 , 5 ] . 
In brief , strongly type 1 ﬁmbriate-phase bacterial cells were obtained following successive passage every 48 hr in static broth culture medium , while nonﬁmbriated-phase bacteria were found when cultured on solid media [ 4 , 5 ] . 
Subsequent investigations hav indicated that phenotypic expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae in Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium involves the interaction of several genes in the ﬁm gene cluster [ 6 -- 9 ] . 
To explore whether there is another genetic determinant outside the ﬁm genes that would also participate in regulation of type 1 ﬁmbriae in Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium , Chuang et al. constructed an insertional library to screen for mutant strains that showed different type 1 ﬁmbrial phenotypes than the parental strain [ 10 ] . 
Yeast agglutination test and southern blot analysis were used to screen for those mutants and validated that the transpositional event occurred only once . 
A group of genes classiﬁed as having ﬁmbrial biosynthesis and regulation were involved in the expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae in response to different culture conditions [ 10 ] . 
One mutant stbC strain agglutinated yeast obtained either from static LB broth or on solid LB agar medium , and the agglutination was mannose-sensitive [ 10 ] . 
The gene stbC encoded the usher protein for Stb ﬁmbriae in Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 11 ] . 
The usher protein helps anchor the developing ﬁmbrial subunit structure to the outer membrane [ 12 ] . 
Cross-talk between different ﬁmbrial systems in one strain has been documented [ 13 -- 15 ] . 
Therefore , the interaction of ﬁm and stb ﬁmbrial systems is an intriguing topic . 
This paper describes the interesting characteristics of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium stbC mutant that we discovered . 
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 . 
Bacterial Strains and Culture Media . 
The Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium strain used in this study was the LT2 derivative strain LB5010 [ 16 ] . 
The stbC mutant strain was obtained from the Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium transposon library collection in our laboratory [ 10 ] . 
This strain has a transposon inserted in the position of stbC , encoding the usher protein of StbA ﬁmbriae . 
Salmonella cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Difco/Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) or on LB agar . 
Mueller-Hinton agar ( Difco/Becton Dickinson ) was used when performing the antimicrobial susceptibility test , and modiﬁed semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis ( MSRV ) ( Difco/Becton Dickinson ) was used to detect the motility of Salmonella strains . 
2.2 . 
Yeast Agglutination Test . 
The LB agar plates were incubated at 37 ◦ C for 18 h , while the broth preparations were incubated statically at 37 ◦ C for 48 h. Bacterial cells from the solid agar were collected by a sterile loop and resuspended in 100 µL of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
Cells in the broth medium were collected by centrifugation , and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of 1 × PBS . 
Subsequently , 30 µL of a 3 % ( vol/vol ) suspension of Candida albicans in PBS and an equal amount of bacterial cells to be tested were mixed together on a glass slide [ 4 ] . 
Visible agglutination after gentle agitation indicated a positive reaction for the presence of type 1 ﬁmbriae . 
Any bacterial suspension that produced type 1 ﬁmbriae was further mixed with C. albicans , along with 3 % ( wt/vol ) of a D-mannose solution ( Sigma Chemical Company , St. Louis , MO ) . 
The mannose-sensitive agglutination conferred by type 1 ﬁmbriae was inhibited in the presence of mannose . 
2.3 . 
Electron Microscopy . 
Bacterial strains were grown in static broth or on solid agar and resuspended in 1 × PBS . 
The bacterial cells were then negatively stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid and observed with a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) . 
2.4 . 
Motility Test . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 and the stbC mutant strains were grown in static broth for 48 h and on solid agar for 18 h. Cells were resuspended in 1 × PBS and adjusted to the same turbidity . 
A drop of cell suspension was then spotted on the modiﬁed semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis ( MSRV ) agar medium and incubated at 42 ◦ C for 16 h. 
2.5 . 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 and the stbC mutant strains were analyzed for drug resistance . 
Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disc diffusion method using commercially available discs and Mueller-Hinton agar . 
The following antibiotics were used : ampicillin ( 10 µg ) , penicillin ( 10 µg ) , cephalothin ( 30 µg ) , tetracycline ( 30 µg ) , doxycycline ( 10 µg ) , chloramphenicol ( 50 µg ) , ﬂorfenicol ( 30 µg ) , streptomycin ( 50 µg ) , and ciproﬂoxacin ( 5 µg ) . 
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as the control strain . 
The results were interpreted according to criteria speciﬁed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) [ 17 ] . 
2.6 . 
RNA Puriﬁcation . 
Bacterial cells were harvested in TRI-zole Reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and disrupted using the MagNA Lyser System ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) , with ceramic bead shaking at 5,000 rpm for 15 sec . 
After phenol-chloroform extraction , the aqueous layer was applied to an RNeasy column ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) for RNA puriﬁcation according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer . 
The RNA was quantiﬁed by using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technology , Wilmington , DE ) and then examined with a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technology , Palo Alto , CA ) with an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit ( Agilent ) . 
To enhance the sensitivity of microarray signal , the puriﬁed total RNA was subjected to a ribosomal RNA removal procedure by MICROB Express Bacterial mRNA Puriﬁcation Kit ( Ambion , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . 
2.7 . 
Custom Array Design . 
Probes were designed by eArray of Agilent Technologies . 
In the design process , 4,718 Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 transcripts were uploaded to Agilent eArray and designed by Tm matching methodology . 
Target sequences that were duplicated were removed . 
Probes with Tm at around 80 ◦ C , optimal base content , and low cross-hybridization wer selected . 
The resulting 4,646 probes were then generated . 
The custom microarray was manufactured in 4 × 44 k format by in situ synthesis of oligonucleotide probes . 
Each array consisted of 4,646 Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2-speciﬁc probes and printed in 9 replicates . 
2.8 . 
Microarray Experiment . 
One microgram of enriched mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with a CyScribe 1st-strand cDNA labeling kit ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) and labeled with Cy3-CTP or Cy5-CTP ( CyDye , PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . 
Correspondingly labeled cDNA was then pooled and hybridized to microarrays at 60 ◦ C for 17 h . 
After washing and drying by nitrogen gun blowing , microarrays were scanned with an Agilent microarray scanner at 535 nm for Cy3-CTP and 625 nm for Cy5-CTP . 
Scanned images were then analyzed by Feature Extraction 9.5.3 software ( Agilent ) . 
Image analysis and normalization software was used to quantify signal and background intensity for each feature and substantially normalized the data by rank-consistency-ﬁltering LOWESS method . 
2.9 . 
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RTPCR ) Analysis . 
The bacteria were ﬁrst stabilized by adding RNAProtect Bacteria Reagent ( Qiagen ) and total RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) and RNasefree DNase I ( 1 unit/1 µg RNA ) ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer . 
RTPCR was performed by a SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System ( Invitrogen ) . 
RNA was denatured at 58 ◦ C for 5 min and followed by cDNA synthesis at 42 ◦ C for 30 min . 
The reaction was stopped by heating the bacteria at 94 ◦ C for 2 min . 
The following PCR programming was used : 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 ◦ C for 30 sec , annealing at 54 ◦ C for 30 sec , ◦ and extension at 72 C for 30 sec . 
An additional extension was performed at 72 ◦ C for 10 min . 
Primers used in the present study are listed in Table 1 . 
2.10 . 
Complementation Test . 
The primer set , stbC-F and stbC-R , was used to amplify the stbC coding sequence from the genomic DNA of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB 5010 with the Epicentre FailSafe PCR PreMix Selection kit ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) . 
The resulting DNA fragment was cleaved with BamHI and ligated into the pACYC 184 vector . 
HindIII and SalI were then used to cleave a 2.9 kb DNA fragment possessing the stbC coding sequence from the aforementioned recombinant plasmid and ligated into the pBBR1MCS-5 vector that carries a gentamycin-resistant gene [ 18 ] . 
The resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed into the stbC mutant strain , and transformants were selected on gentamycin-containing ( 100 µg / mL ) LB agar medium . 
A transformant labeled stbC ( pStbC ) was selected for further study . 
For the control , the pBBR1MCS-5 vector was transformed into the stbC mutant , and a resulting transformant labeled stbC ( vector ) was selected . 
3. Results
3.1 . 
Yeast Agglutination Test . 
A stbC mutant prepared on both static LB broth and LB agar medium both exhibited agglutination when mixed with yeast cells on a glass slide . 
The addition of mannose inhibited agglutination , indicating that agglutination was mannose-sensitive . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 from static broth agglutinated yeast cells , while that from agar medium did not . 
The stbC ( pStbC ) harboring the plasmid that contains the coding sequence of stbC exhibited the same agglutination pattern as the parental strain , while stbC ( vector ) , containing the vector alone , prepared on both agar and broth medium , agglutinated yeast cells as did the stbC mutant strain . 
Table 2 compares the yeast agglutination capabilities conferred by these strains . 
3.2 . 
Electron Microscopy . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 prepared in static LB broth culture showed ﬁmbrial appendages on the outside of the cell ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . 
Besides ﬁmbriae , additional ﬂagellalike structures were present on the stbC mutant strain cultured in static broth ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . 
On the contrary , Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 grown on agar medium did not produce type1 ﬁmbriae ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . 
The stbC mutant prepared from agar medium did not produce ﬁmbriae ; either , however , ﬂagellalike structures were still observed around the stbC mutant prepared from agar medium ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . 
3.3 . 
Motility Test . 
The semisolid characteristic of MSRV allows mobility to be detected as `` halos '' of growth around the point of inoculation . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 did not exhibit a `` halo '' effect on the MSRV medium , and the medium remained blue around the inoculated drop ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . 
In contrast , a gray-white zone was observed extending from the inoculated drop of the stbC mutant , prepared either from static LB broth or LB agar ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . 
The stbC was a motile Salmonella strain . 
We also used polyvalent Salmonella H antiserum ( Difco/Becton Dickinson ) to conﬁrm that the ﬂagellar antigen was present on the stbC mutant but not on the Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 by slide agglutination test . 
3.4 . 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test . 
Since we had dificulty complementing the stbC with a recombinant plasmid containing the coding sequence of stbC , we tested whether stbC mutant exhibited resistance to the antibiotic marker carried in the cloning vector . 
We found that stbC was resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline carried in TA cloning and pACYC 184 vectors , respectively . 
Therefore , a battery of antibiotics was tested on the stbC mutant and the parental strain LB5010 . 
Both strains were resistant to penicillin and streptomycin . 
In addition , the stbC mutant also exhibited resistance to ampicillin , cephalothin , tetracycline , doxycycline , chloramphenicol , ﬂorfenicol , and ciproﬂoxacin

Microarray Analysis . 
Since the stbC mutant strain prepared from solid agar produced different results on yeast agglutination testing and exhibited multidrug resistant characteristics , it is tempting to identify the genes that would express differently between the stbC mutant strain and its parental strain Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 when grown on solid LB agar . 
Total RNA was isolated from both strains cultured on solid LB agar and analyzed by hybridization to a Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 DNA microarray . 
The median hybridization results of 9 arrays showed that about 50 genes from the stbC mutant grown on agar were upregulated more than 8-fold ( Table 3 ) . 
Analysis of the microarray data revealed that these genes can be classiﬁed according to their functions , including ﬁmbrial structure , motility , drug resistance , gene regulation , transportation , outer membrane porin structure , prophage , ribosomal protein , inner membrane protein , periplasmic protein , and enzymes of different functions . 
Twenty-two genes are enzymes with a variety of functions ( 44 % ) , and these comprised the major part of the genes upregulated in the stbC mutant strain grown on solid agar . 
The detail results of the microarray assay in the present study can be accessed at GEO accession number GSE34685 . 
3.6 . 
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RTPCR ) Analysis . 
To validate our microarray ﬁnding , several genes were selected and assayed by RT-PCR . 
The transcriptional levels of gcvH ( 5.9 ) , ramA ( 3.9 ) , csgA ( 2.4 ) , cheM ( 7.2 ) , yhcQ ( 3.0 ) , motA ( 2.1 ) , motB ( 3.7 ) , STM0347 ( 1.5 ) , and rpsS ( 1.4 ) in stbC were higher than those in LB5010 when both strains were grown on LB agar . 
( The vales in the parenthesi represent the ratio of stbC/LB5010 . ) 
This was correlated with the microarray data . 
Expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae involved several Fim regulatory proteins and other gene products outside the ﬁm gene cluster . 
FimZ and FimY are positive regulators for type 1 ﬁmbriae , while FimW is a repressor for ﬁmbrial expression [ 6 -- 9 ] . 
We also used RT-PCR to investigate the transcription level of the major ﬁmbrial subunit gene ﬁmA and those of three regulatory genes ﬁmZ , ﬁmY , and ﬁmW . 
Total RNAs from the parental strain Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 , stbC mutant , stbC ( pStbC ) , and stbC ( vector ) were prepared and analyzed for ﬁmA , ﬁmZ , ﬁmY , ﬁmW mRNA , and 16S ribosomal ( r ) RNA expression by RT-PCR . 
Figure 4 shows the RT-PCR results . 
Expression levels of ﬁm genes of LB5010 obtained on LB agar were used as the reference . 
When LB 5010 was cultured in static LB broth , ﬁmA , ﬁmZ , ﬁmY , and ﬁmW had higher levels of expression than when cultured on LB agar . 
The stbC strain demonstrated the same tendency , except for ﬁmW . 
The expression of ﬁmA obtained from the stbC mutant strain wa approximately 4.6-fold higher than that of the LB5010 strain when both strains were grown on LB agar . 
The expression of ﬁmZ was also higher than that of LB5010 when grown on LB agar . 
As a control , 16S rRNA was consistently expressed in all of the strains tested . 
Transforming the recombinant plasmid harboring the stbC coding sequence to the stbC strain conferred on it the ability to express a level of ﬁmA similar to that of LB5010 . 
Gene expression of ﬁmZ , ﬁmY , and ﬁmW was higher in stbC ( StbC ) grown in broth than on agar medium . 
The stbC ( vector ) , possessing the cloning vector alone , exhibited similar gene expression patterns as the stbC strain .

4. Discussions
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 , a LT2 strain derivative , exhibits mannose-sensitive phenotype when grown in static broth culture but not on the solid agar medium culture . 
This strain is nonﬂagellated and not multidrug resistant . 
However , the present study revealed that a transposon inserted in the stbC gene of LB5010 strain conferred it to become a constitutively mannose-sensitive agglutinating , multidrug resistance , and ﬂagellated strain . 
Whole-genome sequence analysis of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 strain has revealed the presence of 13 gene clusters that contain open reading frames ( ORFs ) to encode putative ﬁmbrial subunit and ﬁmbrial-accessory proteins [ 11 ] . 
Laboratory-grown cultures of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium commonly produce only type 1 ﬁmbriae and thin aggregative ﬁmbriae ( curli ﬁmbriae ) [ 19 , 20 ] . 
Although the laboratory culture condition could not induce bacteria to produce Stb ﬁmbriae , such ﬁmbriae did express in vivo by ﬂow cytometry using bovine ligated ileal loops [ 21 ] . 
The fact that mice infected with Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium seroconvert to StbA , a major ﬁmbrial subunit of Stb ﬁmbriae , also provides evidence for in vivo Std ﬁmbrial expression [ 21 ] . 
The amino acid sequence of the StbC subunit shares similarities to those of the usher proteins of the chaperone/usher assembly pathway . 
Usher protein is an integral outer membrane protein that interacts with the chaperone / ﬁmbrial subunit complex , facilitating the release of the ﬁmbrial subunits and their secretion through the usher channel [ 12 , 22 ] . 
This ﬁnding leads to an interesting question : Does cross-talk occur between different ﬁmbrial systems in one bacterial strain ? 
For example , expression of pyelonephritis-associated pili [ 23 ] represses type 1 ﬁmbrial expression in the same E. coli strain [ 14 ] . 
A transposon inserted in the stbC gene of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium conferred it to exhibit mannose-sensitive agglutination constitutively when cultured in static broth or agar medium . 
Nonetheless the stbC mutant collected from agar medium exhibited less agglutinating power than those cultured in static broth medium . 
Titration of the original stbC mutant/agar suspension to 8-fold abolished the agglutination power . 
One reason could be due to the decreased number of ﬁmbriae present on the stbC mutant . 
Previously we have encountered dificulties when attempting to transform the recombinant plasmid containing the coding sequence of stbC to the stbC mutant to perform a complementation test . 
The results of our study revealed that one major reason for this could be the multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) phenotype of the stbC strain . 
The antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated that the stbC mutant resisted a battery of antibiotics . 
Since these antimicrobial agents have different mechanisms of antibiotic action , it is speculated that the transposon inserted in stbC had changed gene ( s ) expression that is associated with MDR . 
Concurrently , the microarray result indicated that ramA and yhcQ were enhanced in the stbC mutant compared to its parental strain LB5010 . 
Our RT-PCR analysis also conﬁrmed this result . 
RamA is a member of the AraC-XylS family of transcriptional regulators that controls one of the eﬄux pump genes acrB [ 24 ] , and the product of yhcQ is a putative MDR pump [ 25 ] . 
Deletion of yhcQ in E. coli reduced the penicillin G resistance [ 26 ] . 
The MDR phenotype of the stbC mutant could be reasonably explained , at least partially , by the increased expression of ramA and yhcQ . 
Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 was derived from LT2 strain , which is routinely used in laboratories for molecular genetics and as a representative of the wild type of Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 16 ] . 
This strain has defects in its ﬂagellar synthesis gene , making it suitable for observing ﬁmbria appendages without ﬂagella background [ 27 ] . 
Accordingly , Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 did not demonstrate motility on MSRV , a semisolid agar medium for isolating motile Salmonella . 
There were no ﬂagellar structures on Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 , prepared either from static broth or on agar medium , while the stbC mutant exhibited ﬂagellar structures under electron microscopy , which was unexpected . 
When tested in MSRV , the stbC mutant exhibited extended growth from the inoculated center on MSRV , indicating the motile capability of the tested strain . 
A transposon inserted in stbC could cause a suppression effect that alleviated the original phenotype exhibited by LB5010 . 
However , some ﬂagella of the stbC mutant observed under electron microscopy were not anchored on the bacterial cells . 
This could be due to the method used to prepare the samples or to the fact that some ﬂagella were actually secreted and without function . 
Interestingly , microarray data and RT-PCR also indicated that the expression of three genes , motA , motB , and cheM , was enhanced in the stbC mutant compared to the LB5010 . 
MotA and MotB are integral to the cell membrane and are required for motor rotation [ 28 ] . 
The product of the cheM gene is a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein II , a sensory transducer . 
All three genes are components of a complicated chemotaxis / ﬂagella mechanism [ 29 ] . 
These results were correlated with the motile characteristic of the stbC mutant . 
One dilemma of the stbC mutant strain we observed was the absence of type 1 ﬁmbriae structures under electron microscopy . 
Agglutination of yeast cells did appear , and it was mannose-sensitive , indicating that the agglutination was mediated by type 1 ﬁmbriae whose receptor contains mannose residue . 
RT-PCR also indicated that expression of the ﬁmA was higher in the stbC mutant than that in the parental 
( a ) ( b ) 
Figure 3 : Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB 5010 and the stbC mutant grown on MSRV agar medium . 
( a ) Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium LB5010 did not exhibit any `` halo '' appearance on the agar surface . 
( b ) a graywhite zone was observed extending from the inoculated drop of the stbC mutant . 
LB5010 when these bacteria were grown on LB agar . 
This ﬁnding was correlated with the fact that stbC had higher ﬁmZ expression and lower ﬁmW expression than LB5010 when grown on agar , which correlated with the previous ﬁndings . 
These results demonstrate that the ﬁmZ gene encodes a positive regulator for ﬁmA , while FimW is a repressor for ﬁmA [ 6 , 7 ] . 
FimA protein may secrete and attach on the outer membrane but did not assemble into an intact ﬁmbrial appendage . 
Use of immune-gold electron microscopy would test this hypothesis . 
Another possibility is that stbC mutant grown on LB agar induced a mannose-sensitive adhesion protein that has not previously been characterized and that is present on the outer membrane . 
The expression of the ﬁmbrial major subunit gene of thin aggregative ﬁmbriae csgA was increased in stbC mutant grown on LB agar . 
However , this laboratory condition is not suitable for Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium to produce thin aggregative ﬁmbriae . 
Collinson et al. demonstrated that static colonization factor antigen ( CFA ) broth at 30 ◦ C could induce Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Enteritidis to produce thin aggregative ﬁmbriae [ 30 ] . 
To better understand whether the stbC gene really does account for the mannose-sensitive agglutination , ﬂagellar formation , and MDR characteristics of this interesting strain , a complementation test was performed . 
When a recombinant plasmid carrying the stbC coding sequence and a gentamycin-resistant cassette were constructed and transformed into the stbC strain , mannose-sensitive agglutination phenotypes and gene expression levels of the type 1 ﬁmbrial subunit gene , ﬁmA , and 3 ﬁmbrial regulatory genes , ﬁmZ , ﬁmY , and ﬁmW , exhibited the same tendency toward the LB5010 parental strain by the stbC strain . 
This evidence suggests that the stbC gene product , an usher of Stb ﬁmbriae , may play some role in the regulatory networ of type 1 ﬁmbrial expression . 
The interaction of different ﬁmbrial systems in a single strain was reported [ 13 -- 15 ] , but in the present study , we could not identify 1 or more speciﬁc ﬁm genes with which StbC directly interacts , nor could we determine if other non-ﬁm genes were involved in connecting these 2 different ﬁmbrial system . 
However , these interesting topics warrant further investigation . 
Proteinprotein interaction using yeast two hybrid system is being investigated in our laboratory . 
Complementation tests did not restore the MDR and ﬂagellar formation characteristics of the LB5010 parental to stbC ( pStbC ) . 
Whether this was due to polar effect or other reasons was under exploration .
