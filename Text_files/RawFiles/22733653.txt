Objectives : To investigate the contribution of multidrug efﬂux pump systems of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to the formation of a competent bioﬁlm . 
Methods : Bioﬁlm formation by a wild-type strain and 10 efﬂux mutant strains was quantiﬁed using crystal violet bioﬁlm assays and visualized using scanning electron microscopy . 
Curli expression was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by measuring binding of the dye Congo red to polymerized curli and by comparative RT -- PCR . 
Results : All efﬂux mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium were compromised in their ability to form bioﬁlms . 
Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the mutants were able to adhere to a surface but were unable to form a complex three-dimensional bioﬁlm . 
Congo red assays demonstrated an inability of the efﬂux mutants to produce curli , a proteinaceous ﬁlament present on the cell surface and an essential component of the Salmonella bioﬁlm extracellular matrix . 
Mutants expressed signiﬁcantly less csgB or csgD than wild-type . 
Chemical inactivation of efﬂux in wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium with the efﬂux inhibitors ( EIs ) phenyl-arginine-b-naphthylamide , carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and chlorpromazine also repressed bioﬁlm formation . 
Conclusions : Our data demonstrates a link between all efﬂux systems of Salmonella Typhimurium and bioﬁlm formation . 
Loss of functional efﬂux gives rise to a lack of curli expression . 
Bioﬁlm formation was also inhibited by addition of a variety of EIs with differing mechanisms of action , suggesting a novel role for EIs as anti-bioﬁlm compounds .

Introduction
Bioﬁlms comprise complex , diverse communities of bacteria with an ordered three-dimensional structure ,1,2 it has been estimated that .90 % of bacteria in nature exist as a bioﬁlm .3 Bioﬁlms are highly differentiated communities that show widespread changes in gene expression and protein production dependent upon location within the bioﬁlm .4,5 Whilst common in nature , bioﬁlms are clinically signiﬁcant and there are many examples of human infections caused by bioﬁlms , including Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lungs of cystic ﬁbrosis patients ,6 Legionella pneumophilia causing legionellosis , many bacterial species involved in periodontal diseases and various device-associated infections of temporary and permanent medical devices .7 -- 13 Bioﬁlms are difﬁcult to eradicate due to their inherent drug resistance ; the concentration of many antibiotics needed to kill bacteria when residing in a bioﬁlm can be up to 1000 times greater than that required to kill cells from corresponding planktonic cultures .3 Various factors have been proposed to account for this , including the impermeability of bioﬁlms , metabolic inactivity and the presence of persister cells residing deep within the bioﬁlm that have an extremely slow metabolic rate and thereby escape the action of bacteriostatic antibiotics .14 Salmonella enterica can form bioﬁlms on diverse surfaces ( including bioﬁlms formed on gallstones in the gall bladder by Salmonella Typhi ) , where bacteria can persist and act as a reservoir for re-infection .15,16 Recently , Salmonella Typhimurium has been shown to form bioﬁlms in vivo on tumours in a murine cancer model .17 Many serovars of S. enterica , including Salmon-ella Typhimurium , are capable of forming bioﬁlms and this ability has been implicated in the persistence of non-typhoidal Salmonella in the environment and in industrial , veterinary and 18,19 medical settings . 
Bioﬁlm formation on foodstuffs is a source of Salmonella infections and several recent food poisoning outbreaks have been linked to contaminated salad leaves .20,21 A wide range of genes have been implicated in the ability of Salmonella to form a bioﬁlm , including genes needed for adhesion and matrix production .22 -- 24 Three major genes involved in bioﬁlm formation by Salmonella Typhimurium are csgD , adrA and bapA . 
CsgD and AdrA are involved in the regulation of curli and cellulose production , the two major components of Salmonella bioﬁlm extracellular matrix . 
BapA is a large protein expressed on the surface of the outer membrane that is also 22 -- 24 required for Salmonella to form competent bioﬁlms . 
Another key mechanism of antibiotic resistance is efﬂux . 
There are ﬁve families of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efﬂux pumps : the resistance nodulation division ( RND ) family , the major facilitator superfamily ( MFS ) , the staphylococcal multi-resistance ( SMR ) family , the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion ( MATE ) family and the ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) 25 family . 
The AcrAB -- TolC efﬂux system , found in Salmonella Typhimurium and other Gram-negative bacteria , is the best characterized MDR system and is the archetype of the RND family . 
It comprises AcrB , an inner membrane efﬂux pump , AcrA , a peri-plasmic adapter protein , and TolC , an outer membrane 26 channel . 
AcrAB -- TolC can export a wide variety of substrates , including biocides , dyes and detergents , and has been found to have roles in multidrug resistance27 -- 29 and virulence .30 -- 32 AcrEF ( a homologue of AcrAB ) has also been shown to have a role in cell division .33 We have recently shown that a number of MDR efﬂux systems , including AcrAB -- TolC , have a role in the formation of competent bioﬁlms of Salmonella Typhimurium .34 Kvist et al. 35 have also described a bioﬁlm defect for various efﬂux mutants in Gram-negative species , including E. coli and Klebsiella . 
Here , we demonstrate a bioﬁlm defect for mutants lacking any of the multidrug resistance efﬂux pumps of Salmonella Typhimur-ium . 
We also show that this is due to a lack of production of curli ﬁbres on the surface of the cell . 
Chemical inhibitors of efﬂux pumps also repressed bioﬁlm formation , indicating a possible novel application for efﬂux inhibitors ( EIs ) in addition to their known ability to reduce drug resistance and inhibit pathogenicity .

All strains used in this study and their origins are shown in Table 1 . 
Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028S ( L828 ) was used as a control strain throughout . 
Isogenic derivatives , where each MDR efﬂux system is inactivated , have been described previously .31 Mutants of all classes of the MDR system were used in this study : RND mutants lacked a functional acrB , acrD , acrEF , mdtABC or mdsABD , MFS mutants lacked emrAB or mdfA , a MATE mutant lacked mdtK , an ABC mutant lacked macAB and a tolC mutant lacked the outer membrane efﬂux channel that partners most of these systems . 
Strains were stored at 2208C on ProtectTM beads and routinely cultured on Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) agar or broth unless stated otherwise .

Bioﬁlm formation assays
A variety of models were used to analyse bioﬁlm formation in this study . 
Crystal violet bioﬁlm assay
Overnight cultures of strains were diluted in fresh , antibiotic-free LB broth without salt to an optical density ( OD ) of 0.1 at 600 nm . 
Ninety-six-well polystyrene microtitre trays ( Sterilin ) were inoculated with 200 mL of this suspension and incubated at 308C for 48 h with gentle agitation . 
After incubation , liquid was removed from all wells and the wells were washed with sterile distilled water to remove any unbound cells . 
Bioﬁlms were stained by adding 200 mL of 1 % crystal violet to appropriate wells for 15 min . 
Crystal violet was removed and each well washed with sterile distilled water to remove any unbound dye . 
The stained bioﬁlm was solubilized by adding 200 mL of 70 % ethanol and the OD was measured at 600 nm using a FLUOstar Optima ( BMG Labtech ) . 
All bioﬁlm assays were performed three times with two biological and four technical replicates per repeat . 
Student 's t-test was used to compare the statistical signiﬁcance of results from each mutant to L828 ( wild-type ) . 
Bioﬁlm mat model
Bacterial suspensions were prepared as above , and 1 mL of this suspension was used to inoculate 24-well polystyrene microtitre trays ( Falcon ) . 
Trays were then incubated statically at room temperature , 308C or 378C for 3 -- 5 days until thick bioﬁlm mats were formed on the surface of the liquid . 
The bioﬁlm mats could then be harvested for subsequent analyses . 
Bioﬁlm assay with the addition of exogenous EIs
Phenyl-arginine-b-naphthylamide ( PAbN ) , carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone ( CCCP ) and chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) were used to observe the effect of EIs on bioﬁlm formation . 
Bioﬁlms were established as above in the crystal violet bioﬁlm assay but with the addition of doubling dilutions of exogenous EI from 1 to 2048 mg/L . 
Scanning electron microscopy of bioﬁlms
To visualize bioﬁlms using a scanning electron microscope , bioﬁlms of L828 ( wild-type ) and efﬂux mutant strains were grown on 10 mm square glass slides submerged in LB broth without salt for 72 h. Slides were then removed from the broth , immersed in ﬁxative and visualized under a scanning electron microscope at a range of magniﬁcations . 
Determination of growth kinetics
The growth kinetics of all strains were determined as previously described by measuring the OD of at least three biological replicate cultures automatically in a FLUOstar Optima .32 Growth was analysed over a 16 h period at 308C in fresh LB broth without salt . 
Staining of curli ﬁmbriae
Phenotypic differences in curli expression were visualized by staining with Congo red ( Sigma-Aldrich Ltd , UK ) as follows . 
The presence of curli proteins on the surface of the outer membrane was detected by diluting overnight cultures 1:10000 in PBS and dispensing 5 mL of this ﬁnal cell suspension onto LB agar without salt supplemented with 40 mg/L Congo red and incubating for 48 h at 308C as described previously .36 Red , dry and rough colonies were observed for strains producing curli and cellulose . 
Pink colonies were observed for strains producing cellulose but no curli . 
Comparisons were made between wild-type and mutants and photographs were taken from the same plates . 
Expression of curli biosynthesis genes
In order to determine whether loss of curli production was transcriptional or due to an assembly defect , the expression of csgB and csgD , the ﬁrst members of each of the two curli biosynthetic operons , was determined for all mutants . 
Comparative RT -- PCR was used to determine the average expression from RNA harvested from at least six independent replica cultures of each strain . 
RNA extraction , cDNA preparation and PCR quantiﬁcation were as described previously .32 Cultures were grown to stationary phase overnight at 308C as for the bioﬁlm experiments ( see above ) before cells were harvested . 
Primers used were as follows : csgB , ATCAGGCGGCCATTATTGGT and TACTGGCATCGTTGGCATTG ; csgD , GGTATTCTGCGTGGCGAATG and AGTAATGCGGACTCGGTGCT . 
Expression of 16SrRNA was used as a control as previously described .32 Student 's t-test was used to compare results statistically . 
Vector construction
Complementation vectors pacrB and ptolC , derived from the low copy number plasmid pWKS30 , have been described previously .30 Overexpression of components of AcrAB -- TolC was achieved using the pTRCHis2-TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) . 
Primers were designed to amplify the entire coding sequence of acrB or tolC , including the native stop codons , to prevent production of a recombinant protein including the c-myc epitope and polyhistidine tags present in the vector . 
The PCR was used to amplify each speciﬁc insert , and these inserts were then cloned into the pTRCHis2-TOPO vector according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
Restriction digests with EcoRI ( acrB construct ) or PvuI ( tolC construct ) followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing of products were used to verify correct construction of each vector . 
After plasmids had been introduced into the efﬂux mutants and selected by growth on ampicillin ( 50 mg/L ) , subsequent bioﬁlm assays used antibiotic-free media ( pWKS30 is retained stably for .50 generations ) . 
Results
Mutants lacking MDR efﬂux systems are compromised in their ability to form bioﬁlms 
Both the crystal violet bioﬁlm assay ( Figure 1 ) and the bioﬁlm mat model were used to determine the ability of L828 ( wildtype ) and mutants [ L829 ( tolC : : cat ) , L830 ( acrB : : aph ) , L832 ( acrD : : cat ) , L833 ( acrEF : : cat ) , L834 ( mdtABC : : cat ) , L835 ( mdsABC : : cat ) , L836 ( emrAB : : cat ) , L837 ( mdfA : : cat ) , L838 ( mdtK : : cat ) and L839 ( macAB : : cat ) ] to form bioﬁlms . 
All strains lacking any of the different efﬂux pumps were unable to form a competent bioﬁlm in the crystal violet model . 
Scanning electron microscopy images of bioﬁlm mutants showed a stark difference in ability to form extracellular matrix . 
Figure 2 shows scanning electron microscopy images of representative mutants after growth on glass . 
L828 ( wild-type ) was able to produce large amounts of extracellular matrix ; however , L829 ( tolC : : cat ) and L830 ( acrB : : aph ) were able to adhere to the glass slides but did not produce any extracellular matrix and did not form mature bio-ﬁlms ( Figure 2 ) . 
None of the mutants formed a bioﬁlm in the mat model at any of the temperatures tested , whereas L828 ( wild-type ) formed a thick bioﬁlm after 48 h ( data not shown ) . 
Mutants were unable to form a bioﬁlm in either model even after extended incubation times up to 96 h. 
Complementation of AcrB or TolC rescues mutants’ ability to form a bioﬁlm
Complementation vectors were constructed for the tolC : : cat and acrB : : aph mutants to restore expression of the inactivated genes , and the resulting strains returned to wild-type bioﬁlm phenotype with the addition of wild-type tolC or acrB on a plasmid ( Figure 3 ) . 
Complementation of the tolC and acrB mutants with wild-type alleles carried on either pWKS30 or pTRC resulted in restoration of bioﬁlm formation back to wild-type levels . 
Growth rates of efﬂux mutants are not compromised
To determine whether the inability of efﬂux mutants to form bio-ﬁlms was related to a general growth deﬁcit , the ability of each strain to grow was compared with that of L828 ( wild-type ) . 
The results showed that all mutants displayed similar growth kinetics to the wild-type parent strain over the duration of the experiment ( Figure 4 ) . 
Mutants lacking MDR efﬂux systems do not express curli genes
Use of Congo red-supplemented agar showed qualitatively that curli production was signiﬁcantly reduced in all efﬂux mutants ( Figure 5 ) that fail to present the classic ` RDAR ' ( red , dry and rough ) phenotype observed when curli is present .36 Mutant col-onies were smooth and pink , indicating a lack of curli production but normal production of cellulose . 
Production of cellulose was also assessed using calcoﬂuor agar and expression of cellulose biosynthesis genes was measured by cRT -- PCR ; no decreased production or expression of cellulose was apparent in the mutants ( data not shown ) , consistent with the RDAR phenotype seen on Congo red plates . 
The expression of csgB and csgD , the ﬁrst genes in both the curli biosynthetic pathways , was also determined in all strains ( Figure 6 ) . 
Expression of csgB was signiﬁcantly reduced , by between 2 - and 60-fold , in all the efﬂux mutants ( an average of 13-fold reduction in expression compared with L828 ) ( Figure 6 ) . 
Expression of csgD was also signiﬁcantly reduced in nine of the ten mutants studied , with between 2 - and 13-fold reduced expression ( an average of 4-fold repression ) compared with L828 . 
The expression of csgD was lowest in mutants lacking an RND class efﬂux system . 
These mutants showed very low expression of both csgB and csgD , whereas mutants of other classes showed smaller reductions in csgD expression .

PAbN is a competitive inhibitor of RND pumps , CCCP abolishes the proton motive force and the efﬂux inhibition mechanism of chlorpromazine is as yet still unclear . 
The same effect was observed for all three EIs : increasing EI concentration decreased bioﬁlm formation ( Figure 7 ) . 
This effect was signiﬁcant , with the degree of inhibition of the amount of bioﬁlm formed by L828 
( wild-type ) resulting from addition of the EIs being similar to that seen as a result of genetic inactivation of the efﬂux pumps . 
PAbN and CCCP were most effective at preventing bioﬁlm formation , with CCCP in particular fully repressing bioﬁlm formation at a concentration of only 1 mg/L . 
The inhib-ition of bioﬁlm formation was not a result of antibacterial action as the anti-bioﬁlm effect occurred at signiﬁcantly lower

Multidrug efﬂux pumps have been recognized as playing a central role in the biology of bacteria and have roles in drug resistance , cell division , pathogenicity and , as recently described , 34,35 the formation of bioﬁlms . 
Here , we demonstrate the inability of mutants lacking any of the nine multidrug resistance efﬂux pumps of Salmonella to form a mature bioﬁlm . 
Efﬂux mutants of Salmonella were unable to form bioﬁlms under various conditions and this bioﬁlm defect was not due to any decrease in growth rates . 
Here we show phenotypically that the bioﬁlm defect in all the efﬂux mutants is associated with a lack of curli production . 
The fact that all the MDR efﬂux pumps of Salmonella can inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation is interesting because these pumps are known to have different roles in terms of substrate export and contribution to virulence .25,31 The AcrAB -- TolC system is usually considered the major efﬂux system in Salmonella , with many of the others cryptic in laboratory conditions .31 The demonstration that loss of any of the MDR efﬂux systems results in a common phenotype is novel and demonstrates coordinated regulation of efﬂux and bioﬁlm formation . 
Curli is an essential component of the Salmonella extracellular matrix and without it bioﬁlm formation is greatly reduced . 
We show here that transcriptional repression of the two curli bio-synthetic operons is responsible for loss of curli production in the efﬂux mutants and thereby bioﬁlm formation . 
The mechanisms of regulation of curli are complex , and in another article we describe the regulatory relationship between multidrug efﬂux and bioﬁlm formation and show a mechanism explaining coordinated regulation of efﬂux and curli biosynthesis that is mediated by global regulators of efﬂux ( S. Baugh , A. S. Ekanayaka , L. J. V. Piddock and M. A. Webber , unpublished results ) . 
We observed that , in addition to genetically disrupting any of the MDR efﬂux systems in Salmonella Typhimurium , chemical inactivation of MDR efﬂux using EIs , with different mechanisms of inhibitory action , all repressed bioﬁlm formation . 
Of the EIs tested , PAbN , a competitive inhibitor of RND efﬂux pumps , and CCCP , a proton motive force uncoupler , had the greatest ability to repress bioﬁlm formation . 
This suggests it is the function of the pumps that is important for bioﬁlm formation rather than any structural role . 
The EIs were able to repress bioﬁlm to the same extent as that seen in efﬂux mutants , demonstrating a good degree of potency of all three EIs tested . 
This indicates a new potential application for EIs as anti-bioﬁlm agents . 
The development of compounds that can inhibit efﬂux and be therapeutically valuable is an area of active research .37 The demonstration that EIs can prevent bioﬁlm formation whilst also potentiating antibiotics and possibly reducing the pathogen-ic potential of virulent bacteria suggests there may be value in developing EIs for incorporation into materials for surfaces that require sterility to be maintained .
