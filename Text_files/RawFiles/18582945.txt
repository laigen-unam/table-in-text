nse o tinct ce Th 2-ass mmu he te CD4 T helper ( Th ) cell diff iation deﬁned by in vitro cytokine-directed culture systems leaves major gaps in our knowledge o mechanisms driving divergent Th differentiation . 
This is evident from our analysis of the respo f mouse ovalbumin-speciﬁc CD4 T cells to different forms of ovalbumin that induce markedly dis responses in vivo . 
We show that live attenuated ovalbumin-expressing Salmonella ( SalOVA ) indu 1-associated T-bet and IFN - . 
Conversely , alum-precipitated ovalbumin ( alumOVA ) induces the Th ociated GATA-3 and IL-4 . 
The early diversity occurring within these CD4 T cells isolated 3 days after i nization was assessed using real-time RT-PCR microﬂuidic cards designed with 384 selected genes . 
T chnique was validated both at the population and single cell levels at different stages of the responses , showing 2-microglobulin to be a more stably expressed reference mRNA than either - actin or 18S RNA . 
SalOVA was then shown selectively to induce the OVA-speciﬁc CD4 T cells to produce many chemokines and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines , contrasting with alumOVA-induced cells that only produced a few Th2-associated cytokines . 
Several cytokines and features associated with follicular helper functions were induced in the OVA-speciﬁc CD4 T cells by both antigens . 
Finally , IL-17RB is strongly associated with OVA-speciﬁc CD4 T cells responding to alumOVA , suggesting that alum may promote Th2 immune response through a role for the IL-25 / IL-17RB pathway .

1. Introduction
abstract
the development of different subsets of CD4 T helper ( Th ) cells that display speciﬁc functions . 
The nomenclature of CD4 Th cells , including Th1 , Th2 , Th3 , Th17 , Treg , Tr1 and follicular helper cells , mainly relates to the selective production of cytokines ( Reinhardt et al. , 2006 ) . 
Generally Th1 CD4 T cells secrete IFN - and protect against intracellular pathogens , while Th2 cells secrete IL-4 and combat extracellular infections . 
Our knowledge of Th com-Appropriate immune responses against pathogens rely upon engineered to express an ovalbumin transgene ; alumOVA , alum-precipitated ovalbumin ; LN , lymph node .

mitment has been extensively provided by in vitro systems . 
This is achieved by subjecting T cells to TCR/CD28 stimulation in the presence of cytokines ( O'Garra , 1998 ) . 
IL-12 drives Th1 differentiation ( Openshaw et al. , 1995 ) whereas IL-4 induces Th2 cells ( Hsieh et al. , 1992 ) . 
Although in vitro IL-4 initiates Th2 differentiation , in vivo IL-4 and IL-4-signaling are dispensable for the induction of many Th2-features ( Cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2004b ; Finkelman et al. , 2000 ; Jankovic et al. , 2000 ; Noben-Trauth et al. , 1997 ; Ouyang et al. , 2000 ) . 
Indeed , various types of immunization inducing Th2 responses , such as alum-precipitated protein or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis , or ovalbumin-induced allergic lung pathologies , have been reported to induce IL-4 producing CD4 T cells efﬁciently in IL-4 / IL-13 - or IL-4R - deﬁcient mice ( Cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2004b ; Voehringer et al. , 2006 ) . 
This cautions that CD4 T cell polarization may be more heterogeneous in vivo , where a range of signals are delivered by dynamic cellular and molecular interactions within speciﬁc microenvironments ( Bajenoff et al. , 2006 , 2003 ; Katakai et al. , 2004 ) . 
Therefore the early gene expression proﬁle of T cells committed towards Th1 or Th2 in vivo may give insight into signalin pathways involved in this polarization . 
To study the requirements during Th differentiation in vivo , we transferred naıve ovalbumin ( OVA ) - speciﬁc transgenic CD4 T ( OTII ) cells into normal mice that were then immunized with speciﬁc forms of OVA driving either a Th1 or a Th2 type of immune response . 
The response in the draining lymph node ( LN ) was followed after immunizing subcutaneously , either with a Th1 inducer -- live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium engineered to express an OVA transgene ( SalOVA ) , or Th2 inducer -- alum-precipitated OVA ( alumOVA ) . 
The resolution of primary Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection depends on the appropriate induction of CD4 Th1 cells ( Hess et al. , 1996 ; Ravindran et al. , 2005 ) . 
Protective roles have been shown for IFN - , TNF - , IL-1 , IL-12 , IL-15 , and IL-18 , whereas IL-4 and IL-10 have been reported to inhibit host defenses against Salmonella ( Eckmann and Kagnoff , 2001 ) . 
T-bet , a key transcription factor for IFN - induction , is required for resistance to Salmonella infection ( Ravindran et al. , 2005 ) . 
In addition , attenuated Salmonella induce a T-dependent antibody response with switching to IgG2a ( IgG2c in C57Bl/6 mice ) ( Cunningham et al. , 2007 , 2004a ; McSorley and Jenkins , 2000 ) . 
By contrast , the use of alum-precipitated proteins induces Th2 type of immune responses ( Brewer et al. , 1999 ) . 
Although alum is one of the most widely used adjuvant in human vaccines , the mechanism by which it promotes very strong antibody - and Th2-immune responses remains unclear . 
It promotes the production of cytokines ( IL-4 ) , Th2-associated transcription factors ( GATA-3 , c-maf , NIP45 ) , and switching to IgG1 and IgE ( Cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2004a ) . 
GATA-3 , a key transcription factor for IL-4 production , is important for the development and maintenance of Th2-responses ( Pai et al. , 2004 ; Zhu et al. , 2004 ) . 
We have used the fundamentally different T and B cell outcomes of these immunization protocols to analyze the divergent differentiation of OTII cells in responses to SalOVA and alumOVA . 
In this study , after characterizing the classical Th1 and Th2 T cell features of the two responses , a more extensive search for differences and similarities in effector functions that develop alongside IFN - - or IL-4-producing OTII cells was assessed . 
We performed real time RT-PCR using low-density microﬂuidic cards designed with 384 individual gene expression assays selected for their roles in different biological processes relevant to T cell differentiation and function ( Chtanova et al. , 2001 , 2005 , 2004 ; Rogge et al. , 2000 ) . 
This report validates the use of this approach and shows that gene expression proﬁle , assessed 3 days after challenge , shows multiple consistent differences and similarities between SalOVA - and alumOVA-responding OTII cells .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Mice
Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were from HO Harlan OLAC Ltd. ( Bicester , U.K. ) . 
OTII mice , which are transgenic for TCR speciﬁc for 323 -- 339 OVA-peptide in the context of H-2 I-Ab ( Charles River , Wilmington , MA ) , were crossed to CD45 .1 + C57BL/6J congenic mice ( The Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine ) . 
All animals were maintained under standard animal house conditions in accordance with local and U.K. Home Ofﬁce regulations . 
2.2. T cell puriﬁcation and adoptive transfer
CD4 T cells from LN of OTII mice were puriﬁed using anti-CD4 MACS microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec Ltd. , Bisley , U.K. ) . 
Five 106 T cells were labeled with CFSE ( Cambridge Bioscience , Cambridge , U.K. ) and injected i.v. into recipients . 
Mice were immunized the following day . 
2.3. Immunization, Ag and ovalbumin-expressing Salmonella
OVA ( Pierce ) is mixed with 9 % aluminium potassium sulfate ( A7167 Sigma ) solution then , after the pH is adjusted to pH7 , the mix is let to precipitate in the dark for 30 min . 
Ten micrograms of OVA precipitated with alum in a ﬁnal volume of 10 l was injected subcutaneously into footpad of the rear feet . 
Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium aroA-strain SL3261 ( Hoiseth and Stocker , 1981 ) expressing OVA were generated as follows . 
The ova gene was ampliﬁed from the pcDNA3-OVA vector ( gift from Dr. Martin Zenke , Aachen University Medical School , Germany ) ( Diebold et al. , 2001 ) and cloned into pCR2 .1 TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . 
The gene was then ligated into a modiﬁed pet22b + ( Novagen , Merck Biosciences , U.K. ) that allows constitutive gene expression by replacement of the T7 promoter region and lac operator by an adapted tac promoter using GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis system ( Promega ) . 
The resulting plasmid pettacOVA was then electroporated into Salmonella . 
OVA protein expression was con-ﬁrmed by Western blotting . 
The stability of the plasmid was tested by showing that 35 days after i.p. infection > 90 % of the recoverable bacteria still expressed the plasmid . 
Further tests conﬁrmed that plasmid containing organisms colonized the host as well as non-modiﬁed Salmonella . 
The bacterial concentration was quantiﬁed at OD600 using growth curves . 
Bacteria growing in mid-log range were used for studies of the immune response to SalOVA . 
106 live organisms were injected subcutaneously in the rear footpads in 10 l. 
2.4. Flow cytometry, T cell analysis and FACS-cell sorting
Popliteal LN were digested for 20 min at room temperature with collagenase type II ( 1 mg/ml ) ( Lorne Laboratories Ltd , Reading , U.K. ) and DNase I ( 0.15 mg/ml ) ( Sigma ) , followed by 5 min treatment with 10 mM EDTA ( Sigma ) . 
Anti-CD45 .1 - PE ( A20 ) , CD4-PerCP-Cy5 .5 ( RM4-5 ) , biotinylated anti-CD69 ( H1 .2 F3 ) , CD62L ( MEL-14 ) , CD44 ( IM7 ) , and streptavidin-APC were from PharMingen . 
Populations or single cells were sorted by ﬂow cytometry ( MoFlo , DakoCytomation , U.K. ) . 
Sorted cells purity was assessed on a FACScalibur ( Becton Dickinson ) . 
Final analysis and graphical output were performed using FlowJo software ( Treestar , Costa Mesa , CA ) . 
2.5. Intracellular cytokine staining
Day 6 after immunization popliteal LN cells were incubated at 5 × 106 cells/ml with or without 10 M free 323 -- 339 OVA-peptide for 6 h prior to cytokine detection . 
Intracellular FACS staining was performed using Cytoﬁx / cytoperm kit ( Becton Dickinson ) . 
Anti-IL-4-APC ( 11B11 ) , IFN - - biotin ( X.MG1 .2 ) , and streptavidin-APC were from PharMingen . 
2.6. Real-time semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Cell suspension mRNA was prepared using RNeasy columns from Qiagen . 
Reverse transcription was performed with random oligonucleotides ( Promega ) using MMLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) for 1 h at 42 ◦ C. Relative quantiﬁcation of speciﬁc cDNA species to - actin or 2-microglobulin messenger was carried out in a duplex PCR using TaqMan chemistry ( Applied Biosystems , Warrington , U.K. ) . 
As a prerequisite , the ampliﬁcation efﬁciency was conﬁrmed for each combination for the two sets of primers/probes . 
Probes for cytokines and transcription factors were detected via a 5 ′ label with FAM , while probe for - actin or 2-microglobulin were 5 ′ labeled with VIC or NED , respectively . 
TaqMan probes and primers were designed using Primer Express software ( Applied Biosystems ) and sequences are detailed below 
Single cells were collected in 384 well plates containing 2 l of cell-to-signal lysis buffer ( Ambion , U.K. ) . 
mRNA were speciﬁcally reverse-transcribed and the PCR performed by adding 8 l of a mix containing the Quantitect enzyme RT-PCR master mix ( Qiagen Quantitect Probe RT-PCR kit ) , primers and probes . 
Standard reaction conditions for the TaqMan RT-PCR or PCR were used on the ABI 7900 .

Primers and probes were from Applied Biosystems or Eurogentec . 
2.8. Microﬂuidic cards real-time semi-quantitative RT-PCR and analysis
The microﬂuidic cards were designed using commercial TaqMan ® Low Density Array ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
TaqMan ® Gene Expression Assays were loaded into the array 's 384-well cards by the manufacturer . 
The list of all 384 genes spotted onto the microﬂuidic cards has been deposited in GEO database ( Platform GPL5073 ) . 
mRNA was prepared using RNeasy columns from Qiagen in a ﬁnal volume of 100 l to which 660 l of a mix containing the Quantitect enzyme RT-PCR master mix was added . 
95 l of this mix was loaded onto each of the 8 channels of the 384-well cards . 
Reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed sequentially onto the microﬂuidic cards . 
Standard reaction conditions for the TaqMan RT-PCR or PCR were used on the ABI 7900 . 
mRNA transcript level of each gene was analyzed using Applied Biosystem 's SDS software by setting thresholds determining the cycle number at which the threshold was reached ( Ct ) . 
For a given gene , the threshold value was kept constant in all 9 samples . 
The Ct of the 2-microglobulin was subtracted from the Ct of the target gene and the relative amount was calculated as 2 − Ct. . 
These data are deposited in GEO database under GSE7481 access number ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token= rdgvfckuwcuaqxk & acc = GSE7481 ) . 
Genes for which the assay failed or was below the detection level ( Ct > 40 ) were given a ﬁxed value ( 0 for 2 − Ct and − 15.5 for − Ct ) to reﬂect the absence of expression . 
Genes that were not expressed or had 4 or less values shared out within the three conditions ( naıve , SalOVA , alumOVA ) were removed from the analysis . 
Relative amounts from the 324 remaining genes were subjected to three entries ( naıve , SalOVA , alumOVA ) multi-class signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays applying a 0.5 % false discovery rate . 
Statistical signiﬁcance of differentially expressed genes was determined using TIGR MeV3 .1 software ( Saeed et al. , 2003 ) . 
This approach retained 248 genes ( 65 % ) . 
Only genes for which difference between naıve and activated cells was superior to 2 were kept in the analysis . 
The remaining 194 genes were classiﬁed by functional family for analysis . 
In order to facilitate the viewing of the results , the − Ct values were submitted to a clustering analysis . 
The variation of each gene expression is displayed with a mean-centered normalization . 
Genes that had a 2 -- 5-fold or more than 5-fold differences between SalOVA - and alumOVA-responding OTII cells were highlighted using turquoise or blue boxes/text in the corresponding ﬁgure . 
3. Results
3.1. Generation of IFN- - or IL-4-producing OTII cells in vivo
To monitor T cell differentiation , CFSE-labeled CD45 .1 + OTII cells were transferred into congenic wild-type CD45 .2 + recipients . 
The following day , mice were immunized s.c. in footpads , either with SalOVA or alumOVA . 
Six days after immunization , OTII cells were isolated from the draining popliteal LN by FACS sorting ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The sorted cells ' expression of mRNA that characterize Th1 ( IFN-and T-bet ) or Th2 ( IL-4 , IL-13 and GATA-3 ) commitment was assessed by real time RT-PCR ( Fig. 1A ) . 
When responding to SalOVA OTII cells displayed median IFN - and T-bet mRNA levels 200 - and 500-fold higher , respectively , as compared to OTII cells responding to alumOVA . 
Conversely , median IL-4 , IL-13 and GATA-3 mRNA levels were , respectively , 300 - , 60 - and 10-fold higher in OTII cells responding to alumOVA compared to those responding to SalOVA . 
Intracellular cytokine staining shows that the mRNA is effectively translated into proteins ( Fig. 1B , dot plots ) . 
A median of 20 % of OTII cells from 6 SalOVA-immunized mice produced IFN - compared with a 4 % median from 6 mice immunized with alumOVA ( Fig. 1B ) . 
This conﬁrms previous observations that few IFN - - producing cells are induced by immunization with alumOVA ( Smith et al. , 2004 ) . 
Histograms in Fig. 1B also show that the amount of IFN - produced per cell is higher after SalOVA immunization than after alumOVA . 
By contrast , IL-4-production is restricted to mice immunized with alumOVA ( 2 % median from 6 mice ) . 
CFSE dilution shows that , although immunization had induced most OTII cells in both responses to proliferate , only a small proportion of the responding cells , respectively , produced IFN - or IL-4 ( Fig. 1B ) . 
3.2. Further characterization of OTII cells polarized in vivo 3 days after immunization
Before immunization transferred OTII cells present a homogeneous phenotype , characteristic of naıve CD4 T cells ( non-divided , CD69 − , CD62L + , CD44 − ) ( Fig. 2A ) . 
In contrast , 72 h after immunization most OTII cells have undergone between 5 and 7 divisions . 
At this stage , most cells express CD44 , but there is heterogeneity in CD69 and CD62L expressions . 
The total number of OTII cells recovered 3 days after alumOVA was always greater than at the same stage after SalOVA . 
These differences may be attributable to the amount of OVA injected for mice received 10 g of OVA when immunized with alumOVA , while OVA contained in the injected SalOVA is estimated at 0.14 g and represents about 1/1000 of the total Salmonella proteins . 
3.3. Assessment of the reproducibility of the results obtained by dedicated real-time semi-quantitative RT-PCR microﬂuidic cards
Studies of gene expression by OTII cells recruited into the response to either SalOVA or alumOVA were carried out by sorting , 3 days after immunization , OTII cells that had complete at least one cell cycle ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Naıve OTII cells were also isolated from peripheral LN of non-immunized chimeric mice . 
The mRNA extracted from each of the populations was loaded onto the microﬂuidic cards . 
The numbers of cells obtained for each population of OTII cells analyzed are shown in Table 1 . 
The mRNA transcript levels of the different genes were assessed as described in Section 2 . 
Not surprisingly activated OTII cells expressed 20 % more of the 384 genes represented on the microﬂuidic cards than the naıve population . 
The percentages of reproducibly expressed genes in OTII cells from naıve , SalOVA-activated and alumOVA-activated LN , were , respectively , 88.2 % ( − / +2.2 ) , 93.4 % ( − / +3 ) and 94.9 % ( − / +0.8 ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The correlation coefﬁcients , respectively , scoring 0.977 ( − / +0.011 ) , 
3560 K. Serre et al. / Molecular Im logy 45 ( 2008 ) 3558 -- 3566 
0.985 ( − / +0.010 ) and 0.978 ( − / +0.017 ) for the naıve , SalOVA - and alumOVA-activated populations show a high level of reproducibility ( Fig. 3A ) . 
As expected , the greatest variability was observed for genes displaying low level of expression and was more pronounced for samples prepared from the lowest number of cells ( naıve and SalOVA ) ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Conversely , signiﬁcant differences were observed when values obtained for each gene from naıve OTII cells were compared to those of activated OTII cells ( Fig. 3B ) . 
In this case , the overall correlation coefﬁcient scored 0.60 ( − / +0.04 ) . 
Finally , differences were observed when values obtained for each gene from SalOVA-responding OTII cells were compared to those of alumOVA-responding OTII cells ( Fig. 3B ) , the overall correlation coefﬁcient scored 0.976 ( − / +0.02 ) . 
Taken together these results show that the microﬂuidic cards are a reliable tool to compare gene expression in different populations .

3.4. Comparison of endogenous reference genes for expression proﬁling of SalOVA- and alumOVA-activated OTII cells
Analysis of variation of gene expression in differentiating populations relies upon the comparison with housekeeping genes tha remain stable between the naıve and the activated cells . 
Three genes constitutively expressed by CD4 T cells ( - actin , 18S RNA , 2-microglobulin ) were selected to assess their stability of expression in the context of the present study of CD4 T cell differentiation in vivo . 
While - actin and 18S RNA are highly expressed genes , 2-microglobulin is expressed at more modest levels ( Fig. 3A ) . 
When data were normalized according to - actin mRNA levels ( or 18S RNA not shown ) , activated OTII cells appeared to down regulate the majority of the genes compared to naıve OTII cells ( Fig. 3B , red dots ) . 
By contrast , when normalized to 2-microglobulin mRNA levels the activated CD4 T cells show a slight general increase in the level of gene expressions ( Fig. 3B , black dots ) . 
As the genes on these microﬂuidic cards were selected for their likely differential expression by activated T cells , the latter appears to reﬂect more faithfully the acquisition of immunological functions by activated CD4 T cells . 
These observations at the population level led us to compare the behavior of 2-microglobulin and - actin expression at the single OTII cell level at various stages during the differentiation process by real time RT-PCR . 
OTII cells were isolated as single cells as a function of the number of division accomplished , as visualized by CFSE dilution , at the following stages ( Histograms in Fig. 3C ) : non-dividing naıve OTII cells from non-immunized mice ( Naıve OTII ) ; and from mice 3 days after immunization ; ( i ) activated cells , as assessed by high CD69 expression ( gates as shown in Fig. 2A ) , that had not yet divided ( 0 division ) ; ( ii ) cells that had divided 2 -- 3 times ( 2 -- 3 divisions ) ; ( iii ) cells that had divided 6 times ( 6 divisions ) . 
RT-PCR was performed on the single cells derived from each of these 4 sequential OTII subsets . 
When monitored at the single cell level , although both 2-microglobulin and - actin were increased during the ﬁrst cell cycles , - actin showed the greatest level of change for activated OTII cells that had not divided or had undergone 2 -- 3 rounds of division ( Fig. 3C ) . 
This is shown by the increase in the trendline slopes for OTII cells that have just started dividing . 
In addition , the standard deviation obtained varies to a greater extent for - actin than for 2-microglobulin , indicating a cell cycle state-dependent heterogeneity of the - actin expression . 
This might reﬂect the role of - actin in both : ( i ) in the formation of the immunological synapses necessary for DC and CD4 T cell interaction and ( ii ) during the cell division process as part of the cytoskeleton complex . 
These considerations , along with published evidences of the limitations of - actin as internal control for RT-PCR ( Selvey et al. , 2001 ) , have led us to use 2-microglobulin in preference to - actin to normalize the data in the current study . 
Statistical signiﬁcance of differentially expressed genes was then calculated as described in Section 2 .

3.5. Differential gene expression analyzed by real-time RT-PCR
There were selectively higher levels of mRNA for IFN - , T-bet , Hlx , CIITA , IL-12R 2 , in OTII cells responding to SalOVA and IL-4 , IL-13 , GM-CSF , GATA-3 from alumOVA responders . 
These expected results provide further positive controls for the gene expression data . 
Among the 248 genes showing signiﬁcant proﬁles , the 194 of most interest are displayed in Fig. 4 . 
When both groups of activated cells are compared to naıve cells for the expression of these 194 genes , the expression of 82 ( 42 % ) was up-regulated and 10 ( 5 % ) down regulated . 
Fifty three of the 194 ( 27.3 % ) were speciﬁc to SalOVA-responding OTII cells , whereas 52 ( 26.8 % ) were speciﬁc to alumOVA-responding cells . 
The array of cytokines produced by activated CD4 T cells strongly inﬂuences the effectiveness of an immune response . 
SalOVA-responding CD4 T cells expressed the broader repertoire of cytokines . 
These included IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-12 , IL-15 , IL-27 ( IL-30 ) , IL-18 , and IFN - . 
In contrast , mRNA for only a few cytokines including IL-4 , IL-13 , GM-CSF , TGF 3 were detected in alumOVA-responding cells . 
OTII cells were induced by both Ag to up-regulate IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-17 , IL-17C , IL-21 , IL-27 ( EBI3 ) and TGF 1 . 
In addition , SalOVA-responding OTII cells expressed many cytokine receptors : IL-1R1 , IL-1R2 , IL-1Rrp ( T1/ST2 ) , IL-12R 1 , IL-12R 2 , IL-15R , IL-17Re , IL-18R1 , IL-18Rap , IL23R and GM-CSFR 2 . 
In contrast , alumOVA-responding OTII cells selectively up-regulated only IL-6R and IL-17Rb . 
Isolates from SalOVA-responding OTII cells also contained high levels of mRNA for a wide array o chemokines ( CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL7 , CCL9 , CXCL1 , CXCL2 , CXCL4 , CXCL9 , CXCL11 ) . 
The chemokine receptors -- CCR1 , CXCR3 and CX3CR1 -- were also selectively associated with SalOVA-responding cells . 
On the other hand CCR4 , CCR8 , CCRL2 and CXCR5 expression was a feature of OTII-populations induced by both Ag . 
B7 and TNF members expressed by CD4 T cells regulate the outcome of an immune response . 
A large number of B7 and TNF family members , including PD-1 , ICOS , 4-1BBL , DR6 , Fas , GITR , Light , Light-R , mDcTrailR2 , OX40L , TNF - , Troy were up-regulated in mRNA preparations from OTII cells activated by either Ag . 
Interestingly , DR3 , Lt R and TWEAK appeared to be highly speciﬁc to SalOVA-responding OTII cells . 
Furthermore , cell surface molecules such as CD38 , SLAMF7 , SLAMF9 , TLR5 and TLR-9 were associated with SalOVA-responding OTII cells whereas CD59a , CD62L , CD83 , CD200 , CD223 ( Lag-3 ) , CD224 , Edg1 , EphA3 , Galectin-3 , Itga2 , and Neuropilin-1 were found in alumOVA-responding OTII cells . 
No obvious differential expression was observed for molecules involved in intracellular transduction signal ( such as kinases , phosphatases ) , or the caspases and bcl-family molecules involved in cell survival/death . 
Nevertheless , many of these were increased in responding compared to naıve OTII cells . 
Finally , there was clear differential expression of several genes encoding transcription factors . 
CIITA , Hlx and T-bet were associated with SalOVA-responding OTII cells , whereas Fosl1 , GATA-3 , Gﬁ1 , Helios and Nfatc1 were associated with alumOVA-responding OTII cells . 
Fig. 2 .

4. Discussion
Despite the importance of CD4 Th cells in the regulation of immune responses , there is much more to be learnt about the diversity of effector functions induced in vivo by different types of immunization . 
Transfer of naıve OTII cells into normal mice , and subsequent immunization with SalOVA or alumOVA allowed the emergence of distinct effectors to be monitored during Th and Th2 types of immune responses . 
Both SalOVA - and alumOVA-responding OTII populations contain restricted subsets of highly specialized cells producing either IFN - or IL-4 , respectively . 
Importantly , the perspective of Th1 - or Th2-polarization , deﬁned as either IFN - - or IL-4-producing cells does not reﬂect the diversity of effector Th subsets generated during polarized immune responses in vivo . 
Indeed , analysis of the transcriptomes of naıve or activated OTII at the small scale of 384 genes of immunological relevance reveals global differences in both the diversity of T effectors cells and the factors leading to their generation in responses to SalOVA or alumOVA . 
Consistent with the acquisition of a range of effector functions , the majority of differentially expressed genes was upregulated in activated compared to naıve OTII cells either selectively to one or another Ag ( 54 % ) , or induced in both responses ( 42 % ) . 
The results might reﬂect the generation by these two Ag of common pool of CD4 Th cells in addition to selective highly specialized primed cells ; both of these are discussed below . 
This work shows that OTII cells already acquired selective and divergent effector functions by 3 days depending on the Ag -- SalOVA or alumOVA . 
The production of large number of cytokines and chemokines was associated with SalOVA-responding OTII cells . 
These included IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-12 , IL-15 , IL-27 ( IL-30 ) , IL-18 , and IFN - , and CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL7 , CCL9 , CXCL1 , CXCL2 , CXCL4 , CXCL9 , and CXCL11 . 
In addition , they speciﬁcally expressed three TNF family members -- DR3 , LtbR , and TWEAK . 
Although these molecules have been shown to potentiate Th1 ( Bamias et al. , 2003 ; Migone et al. , 2002 ; Papadakis et al. , 2004 ) , or pro-inﬂammatory cytokines ( Chicheportiche et al. , 2002 ; Stopfer et al. , 2004 ) , their potential role in the initiation or maintenance of the Th1 phenotype and IFN - production during Salmonella infection remains to be addressed . 
In contrast , alumOVA-responding OTII cells selectively produce only IL-4 , IL-13 , GM-CSF . 
The possibility that some common CD4 Th cells develop is suggested by the ﬁnding that both alumOVA and SalOVA induce a proportion of the OTII cells to produce some or all of the following cytokines : IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-17 , IL-17C , IL-21 , and IL-27 ( EBI3 ) . 
In addition , genes that are associated with follicular helper functions , such as Bcl6 , CD200 , CXCR5 , ICOS , IL-21 , SAP , PD-1 ( Chtanova et al. , 2004 ; Vinuesa et al. , 2005 ) were up-regulated in both SalOVA - and alumOVA-responding OTII cells . 
Although selective up-regulation of CD200 was more marked in alumOVA-responding OTII cells , the results indicate that follicular Th cells might develop in responses to Th1 or Th2 types of Ag , as previously suggested ( Smith et al. , 2004 ) . 
Our results show that great diversiﬁcation from a naıve CD4 T cell population has already occurred within 3 days after immunization . 
The precocity of this divergent commitment highlights the importance of identifying the ﬁrst signals delivered by dendritic cells that drive CD4 T cells to differentiate and acquire effector functions . 
The model system used has identiﬁed differential gene expression that deserve further study : IL-17Re , CD38 , SLAMF7 , SLAMF9 , TLR-5 , among the SalOVA-responding OTII cells and CD59a , CD62L , CD83 , CD200 , CD223 , CD224 , IL-6R , IL-17Rb , Edg1 , EphA3 , Galectin-3 , Itga2 , Neuropilin-1 , SLAMF6 , Helios and Fosl1 among the alumOVA-responding OTII cells . 
The expression of IL-6R and IL-17Rb restricted to alumOVA-responding OTII cells , for example , is of interest regarding the issue of what , if not IL-4 itself , is the trigger for IL-4 production by CD4 T cells in response to alumprecipitated antigen in vivo ( Brewer et al. , 1999 ; Cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2004b ) . 
IL-6 has been shown to induce CD4 T cells to become Th2 ( Dodge et al. , 2003 ; Rincon et al. , 1997 ) . 
IL-17Rb has been found in human ( Angkasekwinai et al. , 2007 ; Bosco et al. , 2006 ; Chtanova et al. , 2004 ; Wang et al. , 2007 ) and mouse ( Angkasekwinai et al. , 2007 ) CD4 Th2 cells . 
IL-17Rb binds to IL-17B and IL-25 ( IL-17E ) . 
IL-25 injection or systemic over-expression in transgenic mice provokes the up-regulation of Th2-features or proallergic pathologies ( Angkasekwinai et al. , 2007 ; Fallon et al. , 2006 ; Kim et al. , 2002 ; Pan et al. , 2001 ) . 
IL-25 has been shown to take part in the initiation of Th2 differentiation ( Angkasekwinai et al. , 2007 ) or in the maintenance and restimulation of Th2 memory cells ( Wang et al. , 2007 ) . 
Although the mechanism of action of IL-25 has been shown to be IL-4-independent , IL-4 synergize with IL-25 to induce Th2 features . 
It is plausible that alum has the ability to induce IL-17Rb expression in responding CD4 T cells rendering them sensitive to IL-25 . 
Potential sources of IL-25 identiﬁed are CD4 Th2 cells ( Fort et al. , 2001 ) ( although this study failed to show selective IL-25 expression in OTII cells ) , mast cells ( Ikeda et al. , 2003 ) , dendritic cells ( Wang et al. , 2007 ) , and lung epithelial cells ( Angkasekwinai et al. , 2007 ) , suggesting that innate immune cells may ﬁrst produce this cytokine . 
Therefore , it is possible that alum promotes Th2 immune response through the induction of IL-25 and/or IL-6 .

( A and B ) OTII cells ( characterized in Fig. 2B ) were isolated from popliteal LN either of non-immunized mice or mice that had been imm d 3 days before with either SalOVA or alumOVA . 
Speciﬁc mRNA levels were assessed by real time RT-PCR using microﬂuidic cards . 
The number of cycles required to reach eshold signal -- Ct ( see Section 2 ) for each of the target genes minus either the Ct for 2-microglobulin ( black dots ) , or the C for - actin ( red dots ) , was expressed as 2 − t he values were plotted : ( A ) for two samples of a similar population or , ( B ) for two samples of different populations . 
Dots speciﬁc for housekeeping genes ( - actin , RN , 2-microglobulin ) are highlighted by color . 
The equation of the linear trendline , and the correlation coefﬁcient ( CC ) calculated using 2-microglobulin ( black ) , or t ctin ( red ) as reference are speciﬁed . 
( C ) Mice received CFSE-labeled OTII cells and were either non-immunized or immunized with alumOVA . 
Three days later , single ells from popliteal LN were isolated on the basis of the number of cell cycles they had completed ( see histograms top right corner ) as follows : naıve OTII cells , OTII c at had not divided , but were CD69 + ( 0 division ) , OTII cells that had completed 2 -- 3 divisions , or those that had completed 6 divisions . 
Relative quantiﬁcation of cDNA sp speciﬁc of - actin and 2-microglobulin genes was carried out by a duplex RT-PCR on single cells . 
Dot plots represent mRNA transcript level for the two genes , calculated as 2 − Ct. . 
About 130 cells from each subset were analyzed . 
Equation of the trendline and standard deviation values ( red ) are shown .
