The inﬂuence of growth temperature ( 10 , 25 , 37 , and 42 °C ) on the survival of Salmonella Enteritidis in simulated gastric ﬂuid ( SGF ; pH = 2.0 ) and during heat treatment ( 54 , 56 , 58 , and 60 °C ) , on the membrane fatty acid composition , as well as on stress - / virulence-related gene expression was studied . 
Cells incubated at temperatures lower or higher than 37 °C did not increase their acid resistance , with the maximum D-value of 3.07 min in cells grown at 37 °C ; while those incubated at higher temperature increased their heat resistance , with the maximum D60 °C - values of 1.4 min in cells grown at 42 °C . 
A decrease in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was observed as the growth temperature increased . 
Compared to the control cells grown at 37 °C , the expression of rpoS was 16.5 - and 14.4-fold higher in cells cultivated at 10 and 25 °C , respectively ; while the expression of rpoH was 2.9-fold higher in those cultivated at 42 °C . 
The increased expression of stress response gene rpoH and the decreased ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids correlated with the greater heat resistance of bacteria grown at 42 °C ; while the decreased expression of stress response gene rpoS at 42 °C might contribute to the decrease in acid resistance . 
Virulence related genes-spvR , hilA , avrA-were induced in cells cultivated at 42 °C , except sefA which was induced in the control cells . 
This study indicates that environmental temperature may affect the virulence potential of S. Enteritidis , thus temperature should be well controlled during food storage .

1. Introduction
abstract
Salmonella Enteritidis , a Gram-negative facultative anaerobe , has been reported as the most common cause of human salmonellosis in the world ( Hendriksen et al. , 2011 ) . 
According to the data of Ministry of Health in Singapore , 300 out of 1480 cases of salmonellosis reported in 2010 were laboratory-conﬁrmed S. Enteritidis , which accounted for 54.3 % of all isolates with a known serotype ( MOH , 2011 ) . 
Foodborne outbreaks of this pathogen are mainly associated with shell eggs and poultry ( Timme et al. , 2012 ) . 
Consumption of food contaminated with S. Enteritidis usually causes fever , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea in humans . 
However , severe illnesses or even death may occur in the elderly , infants , and those with impaired immune system ( Omwandho and Kubota , 2010 ) . 
Cold storage and heat treatment are the most widely used intervention techniques to inhibit or inactivate foodborne pathogens during food storage and processing ( Davidson and Critzer , 2012 ) . 
However , inadequate cooking and domestic refrigerators operating at inappropriate

temperatures in retail displays lead to temperature abuse ( Laguerre et al. , 2012 ) , which contribute to a heat - or cold-stressed condition for the pathogens . 
Pathogens surviving the temperature abuse may become more virulent and have greater resistance to subsequent exposure to acid or heat condition ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2008 ; Evrendilek and Zhang , 2003 ; Humphrey et al. , 1993 ; Sirsat et al. , 2011 ) . 
The mechanisms involved in bacterial stress responses are not fully understood . 
However , a relationship between membrane fatty acid pro-ﬁle and bacterial heat and acid resistance has been established to elucidate an increased resistance . 
In general , greater heat and acid resistance were found in cells with lower ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ( USFA/SFA ) along with higher cyclic fatty acid content ( CFA ) ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2008 , 2009 ) . 
Nevertheless , changes in the membrane fatty acid composition could not explain the tolerance of pathogens under stress in all conditions . 
For example , Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. ( 2008 ) reported that when S. Typhimurium was grown in buffered brain heart infusion ( BHI ) broth with citric acid ( pH = 6.4 ) at 37 °C , the cells had a lower USFA/SFA ratio and a higher CFA content than the cells grown at the same pH but at a higher temperature ( 45 °C ) . 
Yet , the cells grown at 45 °C had greater thermotolerance than the cells grown at 37 °C . 
Therefore , in addition to the changes in the membrane fatty acid composition , other mechanisms are likely to be involved in the regulation of thermotolerance

Several studies have been conducted to elucidate bacterial stress response by examining the changes in gene and protein expression ( Sampathkumar and Dugan , 2010 ; White-Ziegler et al. , 2008 ) . 
The results showed that many types of shock proteins or genes were induced under stress conditions , which were supposed to provide protection to DNA and many enzymes . 
Expression of stress-related genes is initiated by speciﬁc sigma factors , such as σS ( encoded by rpoS gene ) and σH ( encoded by rpoH gene ) ( Ray and Bhunia , 2008 ) . 
It is known that σS supports the survival of Salmonella spp . 
in stationary phase and under environmental changes such as pH and temperature by controlling the expression of up to 50 proteins ( Humphrey , 2004 ) , whereas σH provides protection against cytoplasmic thermal stress by regulating the transcription of the heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) which function as prote-ase and chaperones ( Spector and Kenyon , 2012 ) . 
Thus , we hypothesized that unfavorable temperatures might affect the transcription levels of rpoS and rpoH , contributing to S. Enteritidis stress response under these conditions . 
Although the responses of S. Typhimurium against heat , cold , or acid stress have been studied in the past few decades ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2008 , 2010 ; Mackey and Derrick , 1986 ; Sampathkumar and Dugan , 2010 ) , little is known about the responses of S. Enteritidis under such conditions . 
Moreover , most of the studies focused on the changes in Salmonella heat - and/or acid-tolerance and membrane fatty acid composition under stressed conditions , and the alternation in its virulence status and stress-related gene expression is largely unknown . 
Therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the effect of growth temperature on changes in membrane fatty acid proﬁle and stress-related gene expression for a better understanding of their roles in S. Enteritidis heat and acid resistance at lethal temperatures and in simulated gastric ﬂuid , respectively . 
In addition , several virulence-related gene expressions of S. Enteritidis in response to low or high growth temperature were investigated at the transcriptional level . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strain and culture conditions
Salmonella Enteritidis ( ATCC13076 ) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and preserved at − 80 °C . 
The lyophilized culture was transferred into a test tube containing 10 ml of sterile tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h . 
After two consecutive transfers at 37 °C for 18 h , working culture was used for the following experiments . 
2.2. Growth kinetics of S. Enteritidis at different temperatures
One milliliter of working culture was centrifuged at 3,500 × g , 4 °C for 10 min . 
The pelleted cells obtained were washed twice with 0.1 % peptone water ( w/v ) ( Oxoid ) . 
Subsequently , the pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 % peptone water and serially diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 104 CFU/ml . 
One milliliter of the cell suspension ( 104 CFU/ml ) was inoculated into a sterile ﬂask containing 99 ml of TSB to achieve an initial population of 102 CFU/ml and incubated at 10 , 25 , 37 , and 42 °C . 
Cultures grown at 37 °C were used as control . 
Cell growth was monitored by withdrawing 1 ml of samples at appropriate intervals . 
Samples were serially diluted with 0.1 % peptone water , if required . 
The number of viable cells in the suspension was enumerated by spiral plating ( WASP 2 , Don Whitley Scientiﬁc Ltd. , West Yorkshire , UK ) on TSA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before automated colony counting was performed ( Acolyte , Synbiosis , Frederick , MD , USA ) . 
Number of viable cells , expressed as log CFU/ml , was plotted against time . 
Growth curves were generated by ﬁtting the data to the modiﬁed Gompertz equation ( Gibson et al. , 1987 ) using MATLAB software ( MATLAB Version 7.12 , The MathWorks Inc. , Natick , MA ) : where G ( t ) is the log count of the number of bacteria at time t ( h ) , A is the log count as t decreases indeﬁnitely , C is the increase in the log count as t increases indeﬁnitely , M is the time ( h ) at which the absolute growth rate is maximum , and B is the relative growth rate at M . 
The growth parameters such as exponential growth rate ( EGR = BC/e ) , lag phase duration ( LPD = M − ( 1/B ) ) , generation time ( GT = log 2e/BC ) , and maximum population density ( MPD = A + C ) were calculated . 
2.3. Determination of heat resistance
Cells incubated at different temperatures until they reached the mid-stationary phase were diluted with 0.1 % peptone water to a concentration about 109 CFU/ml and 0.1 ml of the diluted culture was inoculated in 10 ml of fresh TSB . 
Two milliliter aliquot of the inoculated TSB was transferred to an aluminum can ( 20-mm inside diameter × 9-mm length ) for thermal treatment . 
With a slight modiﬁcation , the aluminum can was similarly designed with the aluminum thermal-death-time ( TDT ) disks that have been invented at Washington State University ( Pullman , WA , USA ) to provide ideal isothermal conditions to study thermal death kinetics of microorganisms . 
The can consists of a lower part with sample chamber and an upper part for sealing ( like a screw-cap ) . 
Each part contained an O-ring for hermetical sealing ( Yuk et al. , 2009 ) . 
Prior to use , each can was sanitized by dipping in 70 % ethanol for 15 min and then air dried in a biosafety cabinet . 
Heat resistance was determined by completely immersing the aluminum cans in stirring water baths ( Major Science , Saratoga , CA , USA ) at temperatures of 54 , 56 , 58 , or 60 °C . 
The come-up time , which is the time required for the heating matrix ( TSB ) in aluminum can to reach within 0.5 °C of the set temperature , was monitored with Fluke 54 II thermocouple ( Fluke corporation , WA , USA ) by inserting one of its probe into the water bath and the other one into a special aluminum can containing TSB through a small hole in the sealing cap of the can . 
The temperatures of water bath and TSB in aluminum can were recorded every second and the come-up time was measured . 
After heat treatment , each aluminum can was removed from the water bath at appropriate time intervals and immediately cooled in iced water for 5 min . 
The cell number after come-up time was recorded as the initial cell number . 
Survival curves were constructed by plotting the log10 number of viable cells against time . 
The line of best ﬁt for survival curves was determined by linear regression with Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft Corp. , Redmond , WA , USA ) and the negative reciprocal of the slope was used as the D-value ( min ) . 
Thermal death time curves were constructed by plotting log D-values against treatment temperatures . 
The negative reciprocal of the slope of the regression line was expressed as z-value . 
2.4. Determination of acid resistance in simulated gastric ﬂuid (SGF)
Cells prepared as described above were subjected to simulated gastric ﬂuid ( SGF ) at pH 2.0 to determine their acid resistance . 
Brieﬂy , cells were diluted with 0.1 % peptone water to a concentration about 108 CFU/ml , and 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred into a prewarmed bottle containing 49 ml of SGF in a stirring water bath ( Major Science ) at 37 °C . 
The SGF consisted of 8.3 g/l proteose-peptone ( Oxoid ) , 3.5 g/l D-glucose ( Goodrich Chemical Enterprise , Singapore ) , 2.05 g/l NaCl ( Goodrich Chemical Enterprise ) , 0.6 g/l KH2PO4 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) , 0.11 g/l CaCl2 ( Goodrich Chemical Enterprise ) , 0.37 g/l KCl ( Goodrich Chemical Enterprise ) , 0.1 g/l lyso-zyme ( Sigma ) , and 13.3 mg/l pepsin ( Sigma ) ( Beumer et al. , 1992 ; Sembulingam and Sembulingam , 2012 ) . 
All components were dissolved in deionized water and autoclaved except for lysozyme and pepsin , which were aseptically added after ﬁlter sterilization ( 0.20 μm syringe ﬁlter ) . 
Final pH was adjusted to 2.0 using sterile 5.0 N HCl ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) . 
Viable cell densities were determined by withdrawing 1 ml of cell suspension at appropriate time intervals and dilute with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( Vivantis Inc. , CA , USA ) .

About 40 mg of pelleted cells collected by centrifugation ( 10,000 × g , 3 min ) were used for the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters . 
Extraction of fatty acid methyl esters was carried out according to MIDI Technical note # 101 with a slight modiﬁcation ( Sasser , 2001 ) . 
In the last step of extraction , 0.5 ml of saturated NaCl was added into the test tube after base wash and the test tube was tumbled for 5 min . 
Subsequently , two-third of the organic phase was pipetted into a GC vial and capped . 
The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a Varian 3800 Gas Chromatography ( Varian Inc. , Walnut Creek , CA , USA ) with a Flame Ionizing Detector ( FID ) . 
The column used was Supelco SPB-5 fused silica capillary column ( 30 m length × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 μm ﬁlm thickness ) ( Sigma ) and the gas chromatography conditions were as follows : 1.0 μl of sample ( split 10:1 ) was injected with the injector temperature at 250 °C and gas ﬂow at constant pressure of 15 psi . 
The oven temperature was held at 150 °C for 4 min and then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 4 °C / min , detector temperature was held at 250 °C for 5 min . 
Helium was used as the carrier gas . 
The fatty acid methyl esters were identiﬁed by comparing their retention times with those of the standards , including Bacterial Acid Methyl Ester CP Mix standard mixture ( Sigma ) and cis-11-Octadecenoic methyl ester analytical standard ( Sigma ) . 
External calibration was used to quantify the fatty acids present in S. Enteritidis membrane . 
Calibration curves ( R2 N 0.99 ) of peak area against fatty acid methyl ester concentration were constructed to determine the concentration of the fatty acid methyl esters . 
The results were expressed as the relative percentage of individual fatty acid , which were calculated as the molar ratio of the fatty acid to all fatty acids .

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) analysis 
Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen Inc. , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Quality and quantity of RNA was measured using Nanodrop 1000 ( Thermo Scientiﬁc Inc. , Wilmington , DE , USA ) , and integrity was checked by aga-rose gel electrophoresis . 
Five-hundred nanogram of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcription using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen Inc. ) . 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) was performed using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) to evaluate the transcription levels of stress-related ( rpoS and rpoH ) and virulence related genes ( spvR , hilA , sefA , and avrA ) . 
Complete sequences for the genes of interest were obtained from NCBI database ( accession number NC_011294 .1 ) . 
All primer used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Relative expression was assayed with 10 μl Fast SYBR Green Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) , 1 μl of 0.4 μM forward primer , 1 μl of 0.4 μM reverse primer , 1 μl of template cDNA , and 7 μl of PCR water . 
Reactions without reverse transcriptase were used as negative control to verify the absence of DNA contamination . 
Thermal cycling conditions comprised of 1 cycle at 95 °C for 20 s and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. 16S rRNA was used as the reference gene . 
The relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the 2 − ΔΔCt method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) .

3. Results
3.1. Effect of temperature on the growth kinetics of S. Enteritidis
The growth curves for S. Enteritidis at different temperatures ( 10 , 25 , 37 , and 42 °C ) were generated by ﬁtting the data to the modiﬁed Gompertz model and R2 values for all the growth models were above 0.98 , indicating that the curves ﬁt the data well . 
The growth kinetic parameters , such as exponential growth rate , lag phase duration , generation time and maximum population density , were calculated using the modiﬁed Gompertz equation ( Table 2 ) . 
The result showed that temperature had a signiﬁcant impact on S. Enteritidis growth kinetic parameters , except for maximum population density , which was around 9.4 log CFU/ml regardless of the growth temperature . 
Cells grown at 10 °C had the slowest growth rate , longest lag phase duration and generation time , which was 21.6-fold slower , and 12.1-fold and 6.0-fold longer than those grown at 37 °C . 
Increasing the growth temperature from 10 to 25 °C , or 25 to 37 °C signiﬁcantly ( P b 0.05 ) accelerated the exponential growth rate and shortened the lag phase duration and the generation time . 
However , the growth kinetic parameters of the cells grown at 42 °C did not signiﬁcantly ( P N 0.05 ) differ from those of the cells grown at 37 °C . 
The mid-stationary phase of growth curves were observed at 192 , 24 , 18 and 18 h of incubation at 10 , 25 , 37 and 42 °C , respectively , and these incubation times were used for determining bacterial resistance to lethal conditions and changes in lipid membrane composition and gene expression . 
3.2. Heat resistance
Regardless of heating temperature , the come-up time of the alumi-num can was about 1 min ( data not shown ) and thus D-value were obtained from the linear portion of the survival curve at each temperature after come-up time ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The z-values are expressed as the negative inverse of the slope of the thermal death time curves ( Fig. 1B ) .

Different letters within a row ( a -- d ) are signiﬁcantly different ( P b 0.05 ) , n = 6 . 
result showed that D-values of S. Enteritidis decreased signiﬁcantly ( P b 0.05 ) as the heating temperature increased from 54 to 60 °C , regardless of the growth temperature ( Table 3 ) . 
In addition , S. Enteritidis grown at a relatively higher temperature exhibited signiﬁcantly greater heat resistance than cells grown at a relatively lower temperature when subjected to the same thermal treatment . 
The only exception was that the D58 °C - value of the cells incubated at 10 °C was not signiﬁcantly ( P N 0.05 ) different from that of the cells incubated at 25 °C . 
Moreover , S. Enteritidis grown at 10 and 25 °C had signiﬁcantly ( P b 0.05 ) higher z-value than those grown at 37 and 42 °C ( Table 3 ) . 
These results revealed that the heat resistance of S. Enteritidis would increase after long-term exposure to a relative higher environmental temperature , which might help them survive during subsequent thermal processing . 
3.3. Acid resistance in simulated gastric ﬂuid (SGF)
The survival curves and D-values of S. Enteritidis grown at 10 , 25 , 37 and 42 °C in simulated gastric ﬂuid ( SGF ) at pH 2.0 are shown in Fig. 2 . 
The results showed that the acid resistance of cells was dependent on their growth temperature . 
Cells grown at 37 °C exhibited the greatest acid resistance with D-value of 3.07 min , which was up to 2.5 times higher than the lowest D-value ( 1.21 min ) obtained from cells grown at 10 °C . 
Increasing growth temperature from 10 to 25 or 42 °C signiﬁcantly ( P b 0.05 ) enhanced S. Enteritidis acid resistance ; however , D-value of the cells grown at 42 °C did not differ signiﬁcantly ( P N 0.05 ) from that of the cells grown at 25 °C . 
Therefore , incubation at temperatures that were lower or higher than 37 °C did not increase S. Enteritidis acid resistance in SGF . 
3.4. Changes in membrane fatty acid composition
The membrane fatty acid composition of S. Enteritidis grown at different temperatures is shown in Table 4 . 
Overall , fourteen fatty acids were found in S. Enteritidis membrane . 
The eight predominant fatty acids identiﬁed were dodecanoic ( lauric ) acid ( C12 :0 ) , tetradecanoic ( myristic ) acid ( C14 :0 ) , 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid ( C14 :0 ( 3-OH ) ) , hexadecanoic ( palmitic ) acid ( C16 :0 ) , cis-9-hexadecenoic ( cis-palmitoleic ) acid ( C16 :1 ω7c ) , cyclo-heptadecanoic acid ( C17 :0 cyclo ) , cis-11-octadecenoic ( cis-vaccenic ) acid ( C18 :1 ω7c ) , cyclo-nonadecanoic acid ( C19 :0

cyclo ) ; while the other six minor fatty acids found were penta-decanoic ( pentadecylic ) acid ( C15 :0 ) , heptadecanoic ( margaric ) acid ( C17 :0 ) , octadecanoic ( stearic ) acid ( C18 :0 ) , cis-9-octadecenoic ( oleic ) acid ( C18 :1 ω9c ) , 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid ( C14 :0 ( 2-OH ) ) , 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid ( C16 :0 ( 2-OH ) ) . 
Among the fatty acids identiﬁed , the amount of C12 :0 , C16 :0 , C16 :1 ω7c , C17 :0 cyclo , C18 :1 ω7c , and C19 :0 cyclo were greatly affected by growth temperature . 
Overall , growth at higher temperatures induced an increase in SFA ( C12 :0 , C16 :0 ) and CFA ( C17 :0 cyclo , C19 :0 cyclo ) whereas it caused a decrease in USFA ( C16 :1 ω7c , C18 :1 ω7c ) . 
The USFA/SFA ratio was calculated to act as an indirect indicator of the membrane ﬂuidity . 
The highest USFA/SFA ratio was observed in cells cultivated at 10 °C with ratio of 0.81 , and the value decreased as the growth temperature increased , reaching a minimum value of 0.04 at 42 °C . 
The decreased membrane ﬂuidity at high growth temperature was due to the dramatic decrease and increase in the amounts of USFA and SFA , respectively . 
In addition , an increase in CFA was observed when growth temperature increased . 
For example , a 2-fold increase in CFA was obtained in cells grown at 42 °C compared to those grown at 10 °C . 
These results indicated that increasing the growth temperature resulted in a decreased membrane ﬂuidity and an increased CFA content . 
3.5. Changes in stress- and virulence-related gene expression
The relative expression levels of stress - ( rpoS and rpoH ) and virulence-related genes ( spvR , hilA , sefA , and avrA ) of S. Enteritidis grown at 10 , 25 , 37 and 42 °C are shown in Fig. 3 . 
The results demonstrated that higher ( 42 °C ) and lower growth temperatures ( 10 and 25 °C ) affected the transcription levels of these two stress-related genes in the opposite ways . 
Lower growth temperatures induced the transcription of rpoS , with fold change of 16.5 and 14.4 in cells cultivated at 10 and 25 °C , respectively ; while the transcription level of rpoS in cells grown at 42 °C was 2.7-fold lower than that in the control cells . 
Contrarily , the highest transcription level of rpoH ( 2.9-fold higher ) was found in cells grown at 42 °C ; while the transcription levels of rpoH in cells cultivated at lower temperatures were not upregulated . 
All virulence-related genes were upregulated in response to the higher temperature , except sefA . 
About 6.4 - , 5.0 - , and 2.6-fold upregulation of spvR , hilA , and avrA was observed in cells cultivated at 42 °C , respectively ; however , no upregulation of these genes was observed in cells cultivated at 10 or 25 °C . 
Interestingly , neither lower nor higher temperature could upregulate the transcription level of sefA , which had its highest level in the control cells . 
Therefore , virulence gene expression of S. Enteritidis might be increased after long-term exposure to a relatively higher environmental temperature .

4. Discussion
Bacterial resistance and their gene expression to various lethal conditions including heat treatment , low pH , etc. are highly dependent on the growth phase , with dramatic changes observed between the cells in the log-phase and those in the stationary phase ( Kaur et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 1994 ) . 
Therefore , growth modeling was conducted in this study to determine the difference in the growth kinetics among cells grown at different temperatures , and to ensure that cells in the same growth stage ( mid-stationary phase ) were used to evaluate the effect of temperature on S. Enteritidis heat/acid resistance , membrane fatty acid composition , as well as gene expression proﬁle . 
It has been found that bacterial thermal tolerance could be affected by many factors , such as growth temperature ( Martínez et al. , 2003 ) , pH ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2009 ) , growth medium ( Casadei et al. , 1998 ) , and water activity ( Mattick et al. , 2000 ) at which the bacterium was previously incubated . 
Thus , this study investigated the inﬂuence of growth temperatures on S. Enteritidis heat resistance . 
The results showed that the heat sensitivity of S. Enteritidis decreased as the growth temperature increased from 10 to 42 °C and the maximum thermal tolerance was obtained when the growth temperature was 42 °C . 
This is in accordance with the study by Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. ( 2008 ) who observed that the heat resistance of S. Typhimurium at 58 °C increased as the incubation temperature was raised from 10 to 45 °C . 
However , higher growth temperature may not always result in a greater bacterial heat resistance . 
For example , the thermal tolerance of Yersinia enterocolitica at 62 °C remained the same as the growth temperature increased from 4 to 20 °C ( Pagán et al. , 1999 ) . 
In addition , D70 °C - value of Enterococcus faecium grown at 40 or 45 °C was signiﬁcantly lower than those at 37 °C ( Martínez et al. , 2003 ) . 
These studies indicate that bacterial thermal tolerance might be dependent upon species and temperature range tested . 
Cross protection responses of foodborne pathogens have received a great attention during the last few decades as cells grown at unfavorable conditions might be able to survive during thermal process or stomach transit , which may result in an increased risk of foodborne illness . 
However , little information is available about the inﬂuence of growth temperature , especially low temperature , on bacterial acid resistance . 
Th results obtained in this study indicated that the incubation of S. Enteritidis at 37 °C induced the greatest acid resistance when they were exposed to SGF , whereas growth temperature higher or lower than 37 °C increased their sensitivity to SGF , especially at 10 °C . 
This result is in accordance with the previous report by Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. ( 2010 ) who found that the D-values ( at pH 3.0 ) of S. Typhimurium grown in buffered BHI ( pH 7.0 ) at 10 , 25 , 37 and 45 °C were 2.61 , 4.50 , 10.14 , and 4.9 min , respectively . 
Moreover , the fact that cells grown at higher temperature showed no increase or even a decrease in the acid resistance has also been observed in other pathogenic bacteria , such as Enterococcus faecalis ( Flahaut et al. , 1996 ) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ( Koga et al. , 1999 ) . 
Contrarily , Humphrey et al. ( 1993 ) reported that S. Enteritidis phage type 4 grown at 44 °C survived 2.2 - or 1.3-times longer in lemco broth ( nutrient broth ) at pH 2.6 than cells grown at 20 or 37 °C , respectively . 
This contradictory result in acid tolerance of S. Enteritidis might be due to the difference of strains tested as well as variations in methodologies used to measure acid resistance . 
To explore the possible mechanisms underlying the changes in bacterial heat and acid resistance , membrane lipid composition of S. Enteritidis grown at different temperatures was investigated . 
The results showed that an increase in SFA and CFA and a decrease in USFA were observed in cells grown at higher temperature , which would contribute to a decrease in membrane ﬂuidity due to the reduction in the ratio of USFA to SFA . 
It is generally believed that bacterial cells with lower membrane ﬂuidity exhibit higher thermal and acid resistance ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2008 , 2009 ; Annous et al. , 1999 ; Yuk and Marshall , 2004 , 2005 ) . 
For example , D63 °C - value of S. Senftenberg grown in BHI acidiﬁed with HCl to pH 4.5 was 6 times higher than those grown in non-acidiﬁed BHI ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2009 ) . 
This protective effect could be due to the fact that acid-adapted cells had a lower USFA/SFA ratio than non-acid-adapted cells . 
Moreover , several studies have showed that the synthesis of CFA contributed to an increase in the thermal resistance or acid resistance ( Álvarez-Ordóñez et al. , 2008 ; Annous et al. , 1999 ; Brown et al. , 1997 ) . 
Therefore , the changes in the membrane fatty acid composition could explain the increase in the thermal resistance of S. Enteritidis grown at higher temperatures , as well as , the increase in the acid resistance when temperature was increased from 10 to 37 °C in this study . 
Nevertheless , a decline in the acid resistance was observed in cells grown at 42 °C , which indicated that mechanisms other than changes in membrane fatty acid composition might play an important role in S. Enteritidis acid resistance . 
To survive in a variety of stressed conditions , bacteria have global stress response systems that not only contribute to the physiological changes but also result in the molecular changes . 
Some of these responses are attributed to the alternative sigma factors , such as RpoS and RpoH , which are induced under some stressed conditions , including starvation , heat , oxidative stress , and osmotic pressure ( Abee and Wouters , 1999 ) . 
In this study , the transcription levels of rpoS and rpoH were investigated to ﬁnd out whether these two general stress response regulators were involved in S. Enteritidis stress response during the growth at different temperatures . 
The results showed that the transcription level of rpoS was upregulated in Salmonella cells cultivated at low temperatures ( 10 and 25 °C ) compared to those grown at 37 °C , indicating that a low temperature condition could induce the transcription of rpoS . 
A similar result has also been reported by White-Ziegler et al. ( 2008 ) that the transcription of rpoS was 2.3-fold higher in Escherichia coli K-12 cultivated at 23 °C than those incubated at 37 °C . 
The induction of rpoS transcription found in this study might be due to the indirect effect of temperature on the growth rate from temperature downshift because a reduced growth rate was one factor that could enhance the transcription of rpoS ( Hengge-Aronis , 2002 ) . 
The alternative sigma factor σS , encoded by rpoS , controls the expression of several acid shock proteins in S. Typhimurium , which are res-ponsible for the prevention and repair of acid-induced damage to macromolecules ( Abee and Wouters , 1999 ) . 
Thus , the high level of rpoS accumulated at low temperature might explain why cells grown at 25 °C exhibited a similar acid tolerance response as those grown at 42 °C although the cells had a more ﬂuid membrane . 
The effect of temperature up-shift on rpoS transcription has been examined in E. coli and S. Typhimurium . 
However , the results showed that rpoS in E. coli did not change much in response to the temperature upshift from 37 to 42 °C ( Hasan and Shimizu , 2008 ) ; whereas rpoS in S. Typhimurium was induced 2.58 fold when exposed to 42 °C for 10 min ( Sirsat et al. , 2011 ) . 
The contradictory result observed in this study is perhaps due to the relatively short exposure time in those studies and thus the effect of long-term exposure to high temperature on rpoS transcription in these bacteria was still largely unknown . 
The down-regulation of rpoS at 42 °C might be an explanation that S. Enteritidis cultivated at 42 °C had a decreased acid resistance . 
The induction of RpoH , which directs the transcription of genes encoding molecular chaperones and proteases involved in folding or degradation of heat damaged polypeptides in the cytoplasm , is a protective mechanism that may render bacteria more resistance to subsequent heat treatment ( Chung et al. , 2006 ) . 
The results in this study showed that the transcription level of rpoH was higher in cells cultivated at high growth temperature ( 42 °C ) . 
Although there have been several studies regarding the upregulation of the rpoH gene at the transcription level in E. coli , Geobacter sulfurreducens , and S. Typhimurium when the growth temperature shifts from 30 to 42 °C for 10 min ( Sirsat et al. , 2011 ; Tilly et al. , 1986 ; Ueki and Lovley , 2007 ) , the present study would be the ﬁrst report showing the effect of long-term exposure to the elevated temperature on rpoH transcription . 
The induction of rpoH at higher growth temperature might be another reason behind the phenomenon that cells grown at 42 °C had the highest heat resistance . 
Apart from inducing greater tolerance in the microorganisms against lethal environments , stressed conditions have been found to alter the expression of genes encoding virulence factors as well ( Lenz et al. , 2010 ; Ma et al. , 2009 ; Sirsat et al. , 2011 ) . 
Therefore , the effect of different growth temperatures on the expression of four virulence-related genes , including spvR , sefA , hilA , and avrA , were determined in this study . 
spvR , encoding the regulator of the Salmonella plasmid virulence , has been proven to play an important role in overwhelming host defense mechanisms and inducing lysis of macrophages ( D'Aoust and Maurer , 2007 ) . 
sefA encodes SEF14 , which is a ﬁmbrial protein on the surface of S. Enteritidis conferring Salmonella the ability to attach to eukaryotic cells ( Rank et al. , 2009 ) . 
hilA , a gene in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 , encodes a transcriptional regulator which is essential for Salmonella spp . 
invasion during infection ( Bajaj et al. , 1995 ) . 
Lastly , avrA encodes an effector molecule that inhibits activation of the key proinﬂammatory NF-κB transcription factor and regulates the intestinal epithelial cell tight junction structure during inﬂammation , which helps the bacteria survive in the host and dampen the inﬂammatory response ( Collier-Hyams et al. , 2002 ; Liao et al. , 2008 ) . 
In addition , it has been reported that avrA expression in Salmonella enhanced its invasion ability ( Lu et al. , 2010 ) . 
This study showed that the transcription of all virulence related genes tested was low in cells cultivated at low temperature and was upregulated when the growth temperature reached 37 °C and above . 
Although the effect of temperature on the transcriptional level of spvR , sefA , and avrA has not been reported so far , these results were in accordance with the previous reports that higher temperatures ( 45 and 55 °C ) signiﬁcantly activate hilA , whereas low temperature ( 25 °C ) represses hilA expression compared to 37 °C ( Churi , 2004 ; Queiroz et al. , 2011 ) . 
Similarly , it has been reported that virulence genes are expressed around 37 °C and are switched off at 30 °C or below in Shigella ﬂexneri ( Dorman and Porter , 1998 ) . 
The tight control of the virulence genes by environmental temperature might be a strategy to conserve energy and prevent inappropriate expression of the virulence genes outside the host ( Dorman and Porter , 1998 ) . 
Except for the sefA gene , all other virulence genes tested in this study were highly upregulated at 42 °C

Although the mechanisms behind the over expression of these genes at 42 °C is not clear , it is worth noting that 42 °C is the chicken 's body temperature ( Long , 1970 ) , which may have important implications in S. Enteritidis colonization and invasion of chickens . 
5. Conclusion
This is the ﬁrst report correlating bacterial heat and acid resistance with the changes in membrane fatty acid composition and stressrelated gene expression . 
In addition , the effects of long-term rather than short-term exposure to heat or cold conditions on S. Enteritidis heat and acid resistance , as well as , stress - and virulence-related gene expression were evaluated . 
The results showed that S. Enteritidis grown at 42 °C exhibited greater thermotolerance than cells grown at lower temperatures , possibly due to the increased amounts of SFA which had a higher melting point , as well as , due to the upregulation of rpoH . 
However , decreased membrane ﬂuidity did not contribute to acid resistance of the cells grown at 42 °C and their D-value was lower than the control cells grown at 37 °C . 
The decrease in acid resistance of cells grown at 42 °C might be due to the repression of rpoS . 
These results indicated that acid resistance of S. Enteritidis might not be dependent on membrane fatty acid composition alone but also on some of the general stress response regulators , such as RpoS . 
Most of the virulence genes tested in this study were upregulated under high temperature condition . 
This study manifests that S. Enteritidis exposed to chilling temperatures might be more susceptible to gastric acid and heat treatment , and become less virulent . 
Thus , the present results provide the scientiﬁc evidence why cold storage could be an effective control measure to minimize the risk of S. Enteritidis outbreak .
