Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) enables infecting salmonellae to invade the intestinal epithelium and induce a proinﬂammatory response and macrophage cell death . 
SPI1 expression is controlled by a complex cascade with several transcriptional regulators within the island and global regulators outside it . 
Previously , we reported that DnaK-depleted salmonellae could neither invade epithelial cells nor secrete SPI1-encoded proteins , suggesting that DnaK is involved in the expression of SPI1 . 
Here , we found that DnaK is involved in SPI1 expression through inhibition of 32 protein , which directs the transcription of a group of genes in response to various global stresses . 
Overproduction of 32 resulted in decreased levels of the SPI1-speciﬁc transcriptional regulators HilD and HilA . 
Further analysis demonstrated that the 32-mediated system negatively regulates HilD and HilA at the posttranslational and transcriptional levels , respectively . 
The executioner of this negative regulation was shown to be a 32-induced protein ATP-dependent Lon protease , which speciﬁcally degrades HilD . 
Since HilD can activate hilA transcription , is at the top of the hierarchical SPI1 regulatory loop , and has a dominant role , the posttranslational control of HilD by Lon is critically important for precise expression of SPI1 . 
Consequently , we suggest that SPI1 expression is controlled by the feedback regulatory loop in which 32 induces Lon to control turnover of HilD , and DnaK , which inhibits 32 function , leading to the modulation of lon expression . 
This regulation in response to a speciﬁc combination of environmental signals would ensure that SPI1 expression is restricted to a few speciﬁc locations in the host . 
Salmonella serovars are facultative intracellular pathogens that cause a range of diseases in a wide variety of hosts . 
Sal-monella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes gastroenteritis in humans and systemic diseases similar to typhoid fever in mice . 
Salmonella is typically ingested in contaminated food or water . 
The bacteria colonize the small intestine and invade normally nonphagocytic epithelial cells to gain access to the underlying lymph tissue . 
Invasion is mediated by a type III secretion system ( TTSS ) encoded on a 40-kb island at centisome 63 of the Salmonella genome , termed Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 16 , 21 ) . 
The SPI1 TTSS forms a multiprotein secretion apparatus , called a needle complex , through which effector proteins are injected into the host cell cytosol , where they activate signal transduction pathways , rearrange the actin cytoskeleton , and cause membrane rufﬂing , ultimately inducing uptake of the bacteria . 
In addition to invasiveness , various functions have been attributed to the SPI1 TTSS , including Salmonella-induced macrophage death ( 8 , 25 , 26 ) , entero-pathogenesis ( 59 ) , and secretion of a pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant that directs polymorphonuclear neutro-phil movement across epithelial monolayers ( 30 , 38 ) . 
SPI1 expression is controlled by a complex cascade with several transcriptional regulators present within the island . 
These regulators , HilD , HilC , HilA , and InvF , act in an ordered fashion to activate coordinated expression of the SPI1 genes ( 2 , 10 , 12 , 13 ) . 
The regulatory circuit converges on the expression of hilA , which activates the expression of all of the SPI1 operons encoding the TTSS apparatus , chaperones , and some effectors either directly or indirectly by activating the expression of another regulator , invF ( 3 , 29 , 33 ) . 
HilD and HilC , which are members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators , can each individually bind to the DNA immediately upstream of hilA , and it is believed that this binding leads to hilA expression ( 44 , 45 ) . 
In addition , RtsA , which also belongs to the AraC/XylS family , has been shown to activate the expression of SPI1 genes by binding upstream of hilA ( 14 ) . 
HilD leads to transcriptional activation of hilC and rtsA , which activate themselves ( 13 , 34 , 41 ) . 
Therefore , it is suggested that HilD is at the top of the hierarchy of regulation of SPI1 expression . 
Control of SPI1 also extends to global regulators encoded outside the island . 
Several global regulators respond to a spe-ciﬁc combination of environmental signals that presumably act as cues that the bacteria are in the appropriate anatomical location ( 4 ) . 
The present report suggests that all of the global regulators control SPI1 expression in a HilD-dependent manner , that is , through posttranscriptional or posttranslational control of HilD , which in turn activates hilC and rtsA ( 15 ) . 
One such regulator is SirA in the BarA/SirA two-component regulatory system . 
It has been demonstrated that overproduction of SirA can activate transcription from the hilA promoter only when HilD is present ( 13 ) . 
SirA acts by inducing the expression of two small RNA molecules , CsrB and CsrC . 
These small RNAs are antagonistic to the posttranscriptional regulatory protein CsrA , which binds to the message of its targets and alters mRNA stability ( 43 ) . 
Thus , SirA induction of csrBC prevents CsrA action , indirectly activating hilD expression posttranscriptionally . 
Recently , we have shown that the ﬂagel ¬

lum-related gene product FliZ positively regulates hilD expression at the posttranscriptional level ( 27 ) . 
The systems that negatively regulate SPI1 expression are the two-component PhoP/PhoQ and PhoR/PhoB regulatory systems and FimZY for type 1 ﬁmbrial expression ( 6 , 35 , 42 ) . 
These seem to function primarily through HilE , which binds directly to HilD , presumably preventing its action ( 5 , 15 ) . 
We have previously demonstrated that ATP-dependent Lon protease is a powerful negative regulator of SPI1 expression ; depletion of Lon increased hilA expression 40-fold and caused a 10-fold increase in the invasion of cultured epithelial cells ( 53 ) . 
Lon regulates HilD posttranslationally by speciﬁcally degrading it ( 55 ) . 
We have further demonstrated that the DnaK chaperone machinery is essential for invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella depending on the SPI1 TTSS ; DnaK-depleted Salmonella cells could neither invade cultured epithelial cells nor secrete any of the invasion proteins encoded in SPI1 ( 54 ) . 
In the present study , we demonstrated that SPI1 expression is tightly controlled in the network of the global response mediated by the 32 factor for RNA polymerase . 
32 is the ﬁrst alternative factor discovered in Escherichia coli and can direct the transcription of a group of genes upon heat shock stress and other general stresses ( 40 , 62 ) . 
These gene products , collectively termed heat shock proteins , include molecular chaperones such as DnaK and ATP-dependent proteases such as Lon , which constitute the cellular network for the de novo folding and quality control of proteins under normal and stress conditions ( 22 , 57 ) . 
On the basis of the present results , we gain insight into the complex network for regulating SPI1 expression modulated by the 32-initiated regulatory loop .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and growth conditions . 
All of the strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 
Bacterial cells were grown in L broth ( 1 % Bacto tryptone , 0.5 % Bacto yeast extract , 0.5 % sodium chloride , pH 7.4 ) and L agar , which were supplemented when necessary with either chloramphenicol ( 20 g ml 1 1 1 ) , ampicillin ( 25 g ml ) , or kanamycin ( 25 g ml ) . 
Construction of plasmids . 
Plasmid pTKY720 , in which the expression of lon is controlled by the PA1/lacO -1 promoter , was constructed by amplifying a BglII-HindIII fragment carrying lon by PCR with the lon-F1 ( 5 - GAAAAGCGGAT CCGTAATCGTGT-3 ) and lon-R1 ( 5 - CCGAAAAAGCTTGCCAGCCC-3 primers and subsequent cloning of the fragment into pUHE21-2 fd12 cleaved with BamHI and HindIII . 
Plasmid pTKY748 , in which the expression of hilA is controlled by the PA1/lacO -1 promoter , was constructed by amplifying a BglII-PvuII fragment carrying hilA by PCR with the hilA-F ( 5 - GAGAGTACACTA GATCTATGCCACAT-3 ) and hilA-R ( 5 - TCATCGCCGATTCCAGCTGGG CGATA-3 ) primers and subsequent cloning of the fragment into pUHE21-2 fd12 cleaved with BamHI and PvuII . 
Plasmid pTKY797 , in which the expression of hilD is controlled by the ParaBAD promoter , was constructed by cloning the EcoRI-PstI fragment carrying hilD from pTKY651 into plasmid pMPM-A4 cleaved with EcoRI and PstI . 
To construct plasmid pTKY821 containing the lon promoter , the lon promoter locus was ampliﬁed from the chromosome of strain 3306 with primers lon-F2 ( 5 - AAACAGGATCCGCAGGC TTCT-3 ) and lon-R2 ( 5 - CGTAGAAGCTTCCAGACAACG-3 ) . 
The 347-bp fragment generated was cleaved with BamHI at the 5 end and HindIII at the 3 end and then cloned into the vector pCB182 cleaved with BamHI and HindIII . 
Construction of a hilA : : Km mutant and a dnaK : : Cm hilD double mutant . 
Insertion of a kanamycin resistance ( Km ) cassette ﬂanked by a FLP recombination sequence into hilA on the chromosome of 3306 was accomplished by Red-mediated recombination essentially as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 11 ) . 
PCR products used to construct gene replacements were generated with template plasmid pKD4 and the hilAP1-F ( 5 - TATTATAACTTTTCACCCTG TAAGAGAATACACTATTATCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3 ) and hilAP2-R ( 5 - ACGATGATAAAAAAATAATGCATATCTCCTCTCTCAGAT TCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA-3 ) primers . 
The 1,476-bp fragment generated was puriﬁed and then introduced into strain CS2937 carrying plasmid pKD46 , encoding the Red recombinase , by transformation . 
The Km cassette insertion in hilA was veriﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the chromosomal DNA with the pKD4-P1 ( 5 - GTGGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3 ) and pKD4-P2 ( 5 - CATA TGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3 ) primers and by Southern blotting . 
To construct the dnaK : : Cm hilD double mutant CS3658 , bacteriophage P22 was propagated on a Salmonella mutant in which hilD was replaced with the construct in which hilD is disrupted by a single-crossover event ( 55 ) , and the resultant lysates were used to infect CS2021 ( dnaK : : Cm ) . 
The transductants were selected for ampicillin resistance . 
Subsequently , a double-crossover event in the hilD mutant was assessed by its resistance to sucrose and sensitivity to ampicillin . 
Disruption of the hilD gene was checked by PCR with hilD-F ( 5 - CCGG GGATCCATGGAAAATGTAACCTTTG-3 ) and hilD-R ( 5 - CAATCTGCAG GAATAGCCTCCCATCCTG-3 ) . 
Immunoblotting analysis . 
To prepare whole-cell proteins , bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture and then suspended in sample buffer ( 28 ) . 
Gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli ( 28 ) , with a sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -- 10 % polyacrylamide gel and Coomassie brilliant blue staining . 
The separated proteins were transferred onto Immun-Blot polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes ( Bio-Rad ) and reacted with rabbit antiHilD serum ( 1:12,500 ) , anti-HilA serum ( 1:25,000 ) , and anti-SipC serum ( 1:25,000 ) and mouse anti-DnaK monoclonal antibody ( 1:25,000 ; Stressgen ) , followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immuno-globulin G . 
The enzymatic reactions were performed in the presence of 0.3 mg ml 1 nitroblue tetrazolium ( Wako ) and 0.15 mg ml 1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-in-dolylphosphate ( Sigma ) . 
Anti-HilD , - HilA , and - SipC sera were previously established in our laboratory ( 50 , 55 ) . 
Assay for invasion of epithelial cells . 
Intestine-407 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . 
Cells ( 2 105 ) were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates to obtain about 90 % conﬂuent monolayers on the following day . 
Bacterial cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.5 , and hilA expression was induced by adding 500 M isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and incubating the mixture for 2 h . 
The bacterial cells were washed with Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) and used to inoculate monolayers previously washed with HBSS at a multiplicity of infection of 10 . 
The monolayers were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min , incubated for 2 h at 30 °C , washed thoroughly with HBSS , and further incubated for 3 h in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium containing 100 g gentamicin ml 1 to eliminate extracellular bacteria before lysis with Triton X-100 . 
Bacterial numbers were determined by plating the lysates on L agar plates after appropriate dilution . 
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR . 
Total RNAs were extracted from 1 ml of bacterial culture with the RNeasy Mini kit and the RNA-protect bacterial reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Reverse transcription ( RT ) was performed on 1 g isolated total RNA with a QuantiTect RT kit by following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
PCRs were performed with an Mx3000P QPCR system . 
For each PCR , the reaction mixture was prepared with Brilliant Sybr green QPCR Master Mix with 1 l cDNA , forward and reverse primers ( for hilA and hilD , 0.4 M ; for 16S rRNA , 1 M ) , and the ROX reference dye supplied in a total of 25 l. Thermal cycling conditions were an initial denaturation step for 10 min at 95 °C , following 45 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 95 °C , annealing for 1 min at 55 °C , and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C . 
The following primer sequences were used : for hilA , sense primer CCGAGAGTCT GCATTACTCTATCGT and antisense primer TATCCTTAACACTGCGGCA GTTC ; for hilD , sense primer ACTCGAGATACCGACGCAAC and antisense primer CTTCTGGCAGGAAAGTCAGG ; for the 16S rRNA gene , sense primer GAATGCCACGGTGAATACGTT and antisense primer ACCCACTCCCAT GGTGTGA . 
Stability of HilD protein in vivo . 
Cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.5 in L broth containing 500 M IPTG to induce dnaK expression , followed by the induction of hilD expression by adding 0.005 % arabinose and incubation for 30 min . 
Tetracycline ( 100 g ml 1 ) and glucose ( 2 % ) were then added to the culture to block the translation and expression of hilD . 
Aliquots of the cells were taken at appropriate intervals and mixed with trichloroacetic acid ( ﬁnal concentration , 10 % ) , chilled on ice for 15 min , and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min . 
The pellets were washed with acetone and resuspended in sample buffer ( 28 ) . 
A portion of each sample was separated on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel and immu-nostained with anti-HilD serum ( 1:12,500 ) . 
The levels of protein were quantiﬁed with Quantity One .

RESULTS
The inability of the dnaKJ mutant to invade is due to the marked decrease in the hilA transcript level . 
In our previous study , we revealed that a dnaK : : Cm mutant derived from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium lost the ability to invade cultured Intestine-407 cells ( 54 ) . 
Several SPI1 proteins involved in invasion , such as SipA , SipC , and SipD , can be detected in the culture medium as proteins secreted by Salmonella ( 53 ) . 
SipC and SipD are integral components of the translocation apparatus , which has been shown to be inserted into the host cell plasma membrane upon infection ( 46 ) . 
Furthermore , SipC has been shown to initiate actin polymerization and anchor bundled ﬁlaments beneath invading bacteria ( 23 ) . 
SipA is an effector that can bind actin directly to reduce the critical actin concentration required for polymerization ( 65 ) . 
We have found that neither SipA nor SipC nor SipD was secreted in the culture medium of dnaK : : Cm mutant cells ( 51 , 54 ) , suggesting that DnaK may be involved in the expression , stabilization , and/or secretion of SPI1-encoded proteins in Salmonella . 
The mutation was created by inserting a chloramphenicol resistance cassette including a stop codon and therefore resulted in a polar effect of dnaJ in the dnaK-dnaJ operon ( 54 ) . 
Since DnaK functions as a molecular chaperone with the cochaperone DnaJ , we decided to use this mutant strain , CS2021 , for further analysis . 
To examine whether the disappearance of SPI1 proteins secreted from the cells by dnaKJ disruption is due to loss of expression of the proteins , we initially compared the cellular levels of SipC in dnaKJ cells and isogenic dnaKJ cells by immunoblotting . 
No SipC was detected in the dnaKJ cells , while it was clearly detected in the dnaKJ cells ( Fig. 1 ) . 
To conﬁrm that the absence of SipC from the whole-cell lysate of this strain is due to the disruption of dnaKJ , the mutation was complemented by a functional dnaKJ operon from 3306 in trans and tested for SipC . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , SipC was restored in the complemented strain , suggesting that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is involved in producing SipC . 
We then examined the cellular levels of HilA , which is the central regulator in the overall scheme of SPI1 gene expression . 
No HilA was detected in the dnaKJ cells , but this defect was fully compensated for by a functional copy of dnaKJ in trans . 
Th effect of dnaKJ disruption on the expression of hilA was also examined by measuring the hilA transcript by quantitative realtime RT-PCR ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The dnaKJ disruption markedly decreased the amount of hilA transcript , and this decrease was fully restored by a functional copy of dnaKJ , suggesting that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is probably involved in hilA expression . 
The hilA transcript level in the dnaKJ cells complemented in trans exceeds that in the wild-type control . 
This is probably due to DnaKJ in excess over the normal level , as shown by immunoblotting ( Fig. 1A ) . 
To determine whether the loss of the ability to invade epi-thelial cells by dnaKJ disruption is due to the great decrease in hilA transcript levels , we examined the efﬁciency of invasion of dnaKJ cells expressing hilA under the control of the PA1/lacO -1 promoter system on plasmid pTKY748 , in a hilA background on the chromosome . 
Bacterial cells exposed to 500 M IPTG for 2 h produced sufﬁcient HilA to be detected even in the dnaKJ-deﬁcient background ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Furthermore , the increased HilA levels found subsequent to the activation of hilA by IPTG resulted in a sufﬁcient amount of the SPI1 product , 
SipC . 
The invasion assay with the cultured Intestine-407 cells demonstrated that the induced HilA level enhanced the efﬁciency of invasion 240-fold even in the dnaKJ-deﬁcient background ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Taking these ﬁndings together , it is suggested that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is essential for hilA expression to ensure the production of SPI1 proteins required for the capacity of Salmonella to invade epithelial cells . 
HilD , a transcriptional regulator of SPI1 expression , is de-stabilized in cells in which dnaKJ is disrupted . 
To reveal the involvement of the DnaKJ chaperone machinery in regulating hilA expression , we examined the cellular level of HilD , which has been shown to bind to the upstream sequence of hilA to activate its transcription directly ( 7 , 13 , 34 ) . 
Immunoblotting of cell lysates prepared from the dnaKJ mutant and isogenic dnaKJ cells detected no signiﬁcant amount of HilD in the dnaKJ cells ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The dramatic decrease in HilD caused by dnaKJ disruption was fully compensated for by providing a functional dnaKJ operon in trans . 
Therefore , it is possible that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is involved in regulating hilA transcription by modulating the cellular level of HilD . 
The effect of dnaKJ disruption on hilD expression was then examined in cells with the genetic backgrounds used for immuno-blotting ( Fig. 4A ) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR . 
The results ( Fig. 4B ) demonstrate that dnaKJ disruption moderately decreased the expression of hilD , notwithstanding the marked decrease in the amount of HilD protein caused by this mutation . 
It has been demonstrated that HilD is at the top of the hierarchy of the SPI1 regulatory loop and also activates its own promoter , leading to ampliﬁcation of the regulatory loop ( 13 ) . 
Therefore , the slightly lower level of hilD transcript in the dnaKJ mutant cells compared to that in the isogenic dnaKJ cells could be due to the absence of ampliﬁcation of the regulatory loop by HilD in the dnaKJ cells . 
The levels of both HilD protein and hilD transcript in the dnaKJ cells complemented in trans exceed those in wild-type control cells . 
These are probably due to excess DnaKJ over the normal level , as shown in Fig. 1A . 
Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is possibly involved in the posttranscriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of hilD . 
To test whether the DnaKJ chaperone machinery is involved in the posttranslational control of HilD , we decided to determine the in vivo half-life of HilD in the presence or absence of

DnaKJ . 
In DnaKJ-producing cells , the dnaKJ genes were expressed under the control of the PA1/lacO -1 promoter system . 
The expression of hilD was initiated from the ParaBAD promoter on plasmid pTKY797 in a hilD background on the chromosome by adding arabinose . 
The results ( Fig. 5A ) show the cellular levels of HilD at the indicated times after addition of tetracycline to prevent de novo synthesis of proteins . 
Whereas HilD disappeared at 60 min after the arrest of de novo synthesis in cells in which dnaKJ is disrupted , it was clearly detectable up to 120 min in cells producing DnaKJ . 
The half-lives of HilD in the cells in which dnaKJ is disrupted and the dnaKJ-expressing cells were 33.4 and 182.4 min , respectively ( Fig. 5C ) . 
These results indicate that the DnaK chaperone machinery is involved in the control of HilD turnover .

HilD ? 
It is unlikely that it directly degrades the HilD protein . 
We have previously reported that HilD is degraded by ATP-dependent Lon protease , leading to downregulation of SPI1 gene expression ( 55 ) . 
The genes for the Lon protease and the DnaKJ chaperone are led by two consensus promoter sequences , each recognized by the 70 factor involved in the transcription of most genes in cells and by 32 , an alternative factor the level of which is increased in response to a temperature upshift and other stresses . 
32 preferentially binds to core RNA polymerase to form an E 32 holoenzyme complex , so the increased 32 results in the accelerated transcription of 32-dependent genes . 
In E. coli , it has been demonstrated that the DnaKJ chaperone machinery negatively controls both the amount and the activity of 32 , creating a feedback loop of the 32 regulon ( 31 , 49 , 56 , 64 ) . 
In S. enterica serovar Typhi-murium , we observed that the amount of 32 was greatly increased by dnaKJ disruption ( Fig. 6A ) , suggesting negative modulation of 32 by the DnaKJ machinery . 
We also observed that the dnaKJ disruption stimulated the transcription from the lon promoter 10-fold ( Fig. 6B ) and signiﬁcantly increased the cellular level of Lon in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Fig. 6A ) . 
The ﬁnding that the dnaKJ disruption resulted in an increase in the amount of 32 and therefore stimulated the transcription of lon in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium raises the possibility that the cellular level of HilD may be controlled by the 32-initiated regulatory loop and this regulates SPI1 expression . 
To examine this possibility , the cellular level of HilD was determined in 32-overproducing cells in which rpoH , encoding 32 , is induced under the control of the PA1/lacO -1 promoter system . 
Immunoblotting with lysates prepared from wild-type cells with or without PA1/lacO -1 - rpoH on the plasmid showed that overproduction of 32 resulted in a marked decrease in the cellular level of HilD ( Fig. 7A ) . 
Owing to the dramatic decrease in HilD , HilA disappeared from the 32-overproducing cells . 
On the other hand , the effect of overproducing 32 on the transcription of hilD and hilA was comparatively determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR . 
The results ( Fig. 7B ) dem-onstrate that overproduction of 32 did not signiﬁcantly affect hilD transcription but dramatically reduced hilA transcription . 
The decrease in hilA transcription could be due to the marked decrease in the cellular level of HilD . 
To check whether 32 modulates the HilD level by controlling the induction of Lon , we examined the effect of 32 overproduction on the levels of HilD in a lon-deﬁcient background . 
The results ( Fig. 7C ) show that the increased level of 32 does not result in decreased HilD if Lon protease was absent from the cells , suggesting that 32 controls the cellular level of HilD through the induction of Lon protease , which speciﬁcally recognizes and degrades it . 
Similarly , overproduction of 32 did not affect the cellular level of HilA in the lon-deﬁcient cells . 
Taking these ﬁndings together , it is suggested that SPI1 gene expression is regulated by the feedback regulatory loop in which 32 induces Lon protease to control the turnover of HilD and the DnaKJ chaperone machinery , which can inhibit 32 function , leading to the modulation of lon expression . 
Therefore , the extreme accumulation of Lon due to collapse of the negative control of 32 regulon by dnaKJ disruption could explain the disappearance of SPI1 expression from the mutant cells . 
We conﬁrmed that SPI1 gene expression is controlled in response to global stresses , leading to the induction of 32 , by measuring the hilA transcription in cells exposed to a variety of stresses , including heat shock ( 42 °C ) , acidic shock ( pH 4.0 ) , 5 % ethanol , and 1 mM H2O2 . 
The results ( Fig. 8 ) demonstrate that hilA transcription signiﬁcantly decreased after the exposure of cells to these stresses , suggesting that SPI1 gene expression is under the control of a 32-mediated stress response . 
An alternative explanation for the role of the DnaKJ chaperone in the control of HilD turnover is that it is directly involved in the folding of HilD and its absence accelerates the degradation of HilD by Lon or other proteases , since unfolded proteins similar to irreversibly damaged proteins are nonspe-ciﬁcally degraded by proteases ( 24 ) . 
To address this possibility , we examined whether overproduction of Lon in wild-type cells also decreases the amount of HilD similar to dnaKJ deletion . 
The results ( Fig. 9A ) demonstrate that the overproduction of Lon in wild-type cells markedly decreased the amount of HilD , as observed in dnaKJ cells ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that Lon can speciﬁcally degrade folded HilD . 
Furthermore , we determined the cellular level of HilD in a dnaKJ lon double mutant . 
As shown in Fig. 9B , the decreased effect of dnaKJ disruption o the cellular level of HilD was abolished by introducing a lon mutation . 
The results simultaneously indicate that the lon disruption resulted in the marked accumulation of HilD even in the absence of the DnaKJ chaperone . 
Therefore , it is unlikely that DnaKJ is directly involved in the folding of HilD and its absence accelerates the degradation of HilD by proteases .

DISCUSSION
The expression of SPI1 genes is regulated by a variety of positive and negative regulator genes in response to environmental conditions . 
In the present study , we have demonstrated that SPI1 expression is tightly regulated in the 32-mediated regulatory loop . 
This is executed by the speciﬁc degradation of HilD by ATP-dependent Lon protease , a heat shock protein induced by 32 . 
Since HilD is at the top of the hierarchy of the SPI1 regulatory loop and has a predominant role in regulation , its degradation is essential for precise regulation of SPI1 expression . 
The levels of heat shock proteins are controlled primarily by 32 , which senses the cellular protein folding environment through negative feedback control mediated by molecular chaperones that are also 32 regulon members . 
It has been demonstrated that each of the DnaKJ and GroELS chaperones in E. coli constitutes a negative feedback loop that couples 32 activity to the cellular protein folding state : overproduction of either chaperone machinery decreases both the amount and the activity of 32 ; conversely , chaperone depletion or overexpression of the chaperone substrates , misfolded and unfolded proteins , increases both the amount and the activity of 32 ( 19 , 48 , 58 ) . 
The homeostatic regulation model proposes that induction of the heat shock response relies on sequestering DnaKJ and GroEL by binding to the damaged proteins that accumulate during stress ( 19 , 58 ) . 
The present study has shown that the loss of the DnaKJ chaperone machinery results in the continuous expression of Lon because the negative feedback control is impaired ( Fig. 6 ) , therefore leading to severely diminished expression of SPI1 genes through excess degradation of HilD . 
Consequently , it is suggested that the expression of SPI1 genes is negatively regulated by a 32-mediated stress response . 
On the other hand , the question of whether any of the SPI1 genes are under the positive control of 32 remains unanswered . 
The heat shock proteins , which are alternatively called stress proteins , are believed to be induced during various stages of bacterial infection because pathogens are exposed to a variety of environmental stress conditions such as sudden elevated temperature and stomach acidity before reaching the low-ox-ygen , hyperosmotic environment of the small intestine and the bactericidal mechanisms associated with the host immune system . 
Actually , heat shock proteins such as DnaK , GroEL , and GroES have been identiﬁed among the proteins induced during the growth of bacteria , including Salmonella ( 9 ) , Yersinia ( 61 ) , Legionella ( 1 ) , and Brucella ( 32 ) , within macrophages . 
To cause systemic infection , Salmonella must grow inside macro-phages and must overcome exposure to oxidative stress , acid pH , cationic peptides , and nutrient deprivation , suggesting that the 32-controlled regulon of Salmonella indeed responds to the hostile environment in the macrophage phagosome . 
We have previously reported direct evidence that the 32 heat shock regulon is involved in the pathogenesis of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ; that is , the heat shock proteins DnaK , Lon , ClpX , and ClpP are essential for intracellular growth within macro-phages and the systemic infection of mice ( 52 , 54 , 60 ) . 
In addition to its ability to grow within infected macro-phages , Salmonella has been shown to induce macrophage cell death by mechanisms depending on caspase 1 but not by the classical mechanism depending on caspase 3 , which is a key executioner caspase in the proteolytic cascade leading to cell death ( 36 , 39 ) . 
Rapid cell death is independent of intracellular bacterial multiplication but dependent on the SPI1-encoded SipB effector protein ( 25 ) . 
Caspase 1-dependent programmed cell death is distinct from other forms of classical apoptosis that depend on caspase 3 . 
One characteristic is that caspase 1 is a proinﬂammatory enzyme that cleaves the inactive precursors of interleukin-1 and -18 into their active cytokines ( 63 ) .

Whole-cell lysates were separated on an SDS -- 10 % polyacryl-amide gel and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis 
In contrast , we have found that the lon disruption-containing mutant of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium induces rapid , large-scale cell death by a mechanism involving both caspases 1 and 3 ( 50 ) . 
Furthermore , we have demonstrated that lon disruption leads to the continuous expression of SPI1 genes within macrophages , where they are normally repressed , and that derepression of the SPI1 genes causes massive macro-phage apoptosis . 
A recent report demonstrates that liver phagocytes can undergo apoptotic caspase 3-mediated cell death in vivo , with apoptosis being a rare event , more prevalent in heavily Salmonella-infected cells ( 18 ) . 
Once Salmonella has established a systemic infection , excess macrophage apoptosis would be detrimental to the pathogen because it utilizes mac-rophages as vectors for systemic dissemination throughout the host . 
Thus , SPI1 gene expression must be suppressed to allow sufﬁcient time for the bacteria to replicate , escape , and invade new macrophages . 
Induction of the 32-mediated heat shock regulon by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium that has met the hostile environment within macrophages would be necessary to restrict SPI1 expression . 
That is quite important for suppressing apoptosis sufﬁciently to allow time for Salmonella to rep-licate within macrophages . 
Since the increased DnaKJ and GroES chaperone machineries directly regulate 32 by using a chaperone network ( 19 ) , the heat shock response would ensure an appropriate level of Lon as a negative regulator of SPI1 expression . 
In addition , the induced levels of chaperone machineries would be required to cope with the accumulation of partially unfolded or denatured proteins in cells exposed to the intracellular stresses associated with phagocytosis . 
Bacterial pathogenesis generally depends on the environmental conditions inside host cells . 
Interaction of speciﬁc virulence factors , e.g. , the SPI1 TTSS in Salmonella , with global regulators such as 32 responding to environmental signals would contribute to the spatiotemporal regulation of multistage pathogenesis .
