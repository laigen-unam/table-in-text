Abstract Animals including food animals play a significant role in the epidemiology of Salmonella enterica . 
The control requires identification of sources and institution of targeted interventions . 
This study investigates the diversity of S. enterica serovars , antimicrobial susceptibility , and occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance ( PMQR ) genes in pigs in Ibadan , Nigeria . 
Pooled fresh pen floor fecal samples of pigs collected from 31 pig farms were cultured ; the Salmonella isolates were serotyped and their antimicrobial susceptibility was determined . 
PMQR genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction . 
The 229 Salmonella isolates were made of 50 serovars predominated by rare serovars Salmonella Give ( n = 36 ; 15.7 % ) , Salmonella Brancaster ( n = 17 ; 7.4 % ) , Salmonella Colindale ( n = 15 ; 6.6 % ) , Salmonella Elisaberthville ( n = 13 ; 5.7 % ) , Salmonella Hillingdon ( n = 13 ; 5.7 % ) , and Salmonella Kingston ( n = 13 ; 5.7 % ) . 
The most widely distributed serovars among the farms were Salmonella Give ( six farms ) and Salmonella Elisaberthville ( six farms ) . 
Resistance to chloramphenicol , sulfonamides , nalidixic acid , streptomycin , and tetracycline ranged from 11.6 % ( n = 26 ) to 22.8 % ( n = 51 ) . 
Resistance ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was low ( n = 2 ; 0.9 % ) . 
Multiply resistant isolates included Salmonella Kentucky , the most resistant serovar . 
qnrB19 was found in two isolates of Salmonella Corvallis and one isolate of Salmonella Larochelle , respectively , while qnrS1 was found in two isolates of Salmonella Derby .

The isolates were more resistant to old antimicrobials with some multiple resistant . 
Control measures and regulation of antimicrobials are warranted . 
Introduction
Salmonella enterica is a food-borne pathogen of global public health importance ( Mead et al. 1999 ) . 
Several animals including food animals such as pigs are reservoirs of this pathogen . 
Healthy carriers of Salmonella can transfer the bacteria in their feces by which pork can be contaminated during slaughter and processing ( van Hoek et al. 2012 ) . 
Such contaminated pork and related products can act as vehicles of transmission of Salmonella to humans . 
Transmission can also occur through contact with animals ( Hoelzer et al. 2011 ) . 
In many countries , pigs are associated with significant proportion of human salmonellosis ( Davies et al. 2004a , b ) and several outbreaks have been linked with consumption of pork and related products ( Anonymous 2010 ) . 
There are over 2,587 serovars of Salmonella , which are capable of causing infections in humans but only a limited number of the serovars are of public health importance ( Hendriksen et al. 2009 ) . 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium is prevalent in pigs ( Gebreyes et al. 2000 ; McDowell et al. 2007 ; Futagawa-Saito et al. 2008 ) . 
The diverse Salmonella serovars reported in pigs in subSaharan African countries are predominated by Salmonella Saintpaul , Salmonella Heidelberg , and Salmonella Agona ( Kikuvi et al. 2010 ) but the public health importance in the locals is not fully understood due to inadequate data . 
A key component in control of Salmonella infection is the identification of serovars of public health importance and determination of the sources for institution of appropriate control strat-egies to limit spread ( Nesbitt et al. 2012 ) . 
Salmonella spp . 
are important causes of human salmonellosis in Nigeria but the incidence is unknown due to prevailin shortage of good-quality diagnostic microbiology facilities in Africa ( Clemens 2009 ) and there is sparse data on sources of infections . 
Pig farming is expanding in Southern Nigeria because pork and related products are more consumed than in the Northern parts ; therefore , food-producing pigs present a potential source of human salmonellosis in the country but there is scarce data on the prevalent Salmonella serovars . 
Fluoroquinolones ( particularly ciprofloxacin ) are among the drugs of first choice for the treatment of severe salmonellosis ( Collignon et al. 2009 ) but the increase and spread of antimicrobial resistances has eroded efficacy with public health implications such as increased cost of treatment , long stay in hospital , and invasive infections ( Varma et al. 2005 ; Crump et al. 2011 ) . 
There is global concern for plasmidmediated quinolone resistance in pathogens because it can aid development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance . 
Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials , which is more common in the developing countries like Nigeria , in animals , has been implicated in development of antimicrobial resistance ( Collignon et al. 2009 ) ; in order to limit the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria , there is need for surveillance and appropriate control measures . 
There is scarce information about antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in pigs in Nigeria . 
The aims of this study were to determine the occurrence and diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella serovars isolated from pig feces in 31 intensive pig farms in Ibadan , Southwestern Nigeria . 
Materials and methods
Sample collection
Pooled fresh pen floor pig fecal samples ( 306 ) were collected ( 2010 -- 2011 ) from 31 intensive pig farms ( F1 to F31 ) based on willingness of the farm owners to participate in the study and accessibility of the farms . 
Each pooled fecal sample ( 25 g ) was obtained from a pen and consisted of five different fecal samples of 5 g each , one collected from each of the four corners and one from the center of the pen . 
The pens from which fecal samples were collected were randomly selected from each farm . 
Each farm was visited once . 
Each pooled sample was thoroughly mixed and 5 g inoculated into 25 mL of selenite F broth ( Lab M , Lancashire , UK ) and incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h ( Fashae et al. 2010 ) . 
Thereafter , a loopful of the broth was plated onto Salmonella -- Shigella agar ( SSA ; Lab M , Lancashire , UK ) by streaking and the SSA plate was then incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h . 
Then presumptive Salmonella colonies from the SSA plate were re-subcultured by streaking onto fresh SSA plates and incubated as above for purification . 
All presumptive Salmonella isolates were then identified by standard methods ( Cowan and Steel 1974 ) . 
Serotyping of Salmonella isolates
Biochemically confirmed isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination using Salmonella polyvalent and monovalent O and H antisera ( Diagnostic Pasteur , Paris , France ) according to the Kauffmann -- White classification scheme ( Grimont and Weill 2007 ; Hendriksen et al. 2008 ) . 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Salmonella isolates
The susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials was determined by disk diffusion method on Muller -- Hinton agar ( Merck , Hamburg , Germany ) plates according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) ( 2008 , 2012a , b , c ) . 
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as the quality control strain . 
The antimicrobial disks ( Oxoid , Unipath Ltd. . 
Basingstoke , Hampshire , England ) tested were ampicillin ( 10 μg ) , cefotaxime ( 30 μg ) , ceftazidime ( 30 μg ) , ceftriaxone ( 30 μg ) , chloramphenicol ( 30 μg ) , ciprofloxacin ( 5 μg ) , gentamicin ( 10 μg ) , nalidixic acid ( 30 μg ) , streptomycin ( 10 μg ) , sulfonamides ( 300 μg ) , tetracycline ( 30 μg ) , and trimethoprim ( 5 μg ) . 
Diameters of zones inhibition were measured with a ruler and interpreted by the CLSI guidelines . 
Salmonella isolates with ciprofloxacin disk diffusion zones of inhibition in the intermediate range ( < 30 mm ) were interpreted as showing reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ( M100-S22 ) . 
Detection of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes
Further characterization of the strains showing reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was carried out by polymerase chain reaction assay with primers specific for qnrA , qnrB , qnrC , qnrD , qnrS , and aac ( 6 ′ ) - lb ( Cavaco et al. 2009 ) . 
PCR products were purified using the GFX ™ PCR DNA kit ( GE Healthcare , Chalfont St. Giles , UK ) and sequenced at Macrogen Inc. . 
Analysis of sequences and alignment was done using the Vector NTI suite 9 ( InforMax Inc. , Bethesda , MD , USA ) and the resulting nucleotide sequences were compared by use of the BLAST computer program ( National Center for Biotechnology Information ) .

Salmonella Give and Salmonella Elisaberthville were each found in the highest number of farms ( six farms ) followed by each of Salmonella Brancaster , Salmonella Hillingdon , Salmonella Ituri , Salmonella Durham , and Salmonella Agama found in only three farms each . 
While some serovars such as Salmonella Aguoene , Salmonella Ajiobo , Salmonella Derby , Salmonella Amina , Salmonella Sundsvall , Salmonella Kentucky , Salmonella Luke , Salmonella Gatehead , Salmonella Infantis , and Salmonella ser . 
16 : K :1,5 were each found in only one farm . 
The study also showed the presence of infrequently reported serovars such as Salmonella Fischerhuette , Salmonella Larochelle , Salmonella Morehead , Salmonella Teshie , Salmonella Zongo , and Salmonella Wippra ( Table 2 ) . 
The farms differed in the types of serovars found and their prevalence . 
The serovars found in each farm varied from one ( in 11 farms : F5 , F8 , F9 , F10 , F13 , F16 , F20 , F23 , F26 , F27 , and F31 ) to nine in only farm F1 ( Table 2 ) . 
Salmonella Give was the most prevalent in four farms ( F4 , F5 , F13 , and F19 ) while Salmonella Elisaberthville predominated in three farms ( F9 , F11 , and F30 ) . 
Each Salmonella Kingston , Salmonella Brancaster , and Salmonella Durham predominated in two farms each ( Table 2 ) . 
The pig farms are shown in Fig. 1 .

Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
Five ( 35.7 % ) of the 14 isolates showing reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were positive for qnr genes while all of them were negative for the other plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes . 
The qnr-positive isolates included three qnrB19-positive isolates and two qnrS1-positive isolates . 
The qnrB19-positive isolates consisted of two Salmonella Corvallis isolates ( one isolate each from farms F12 and F22 ) and one Salmonella Larochelle isolate found in Farm F21 . 
All the qnrS1-positive isolates were Salmonella Derby and were obtained from farm F3 . 
Discussion
The observed high diversity of Salmonella serovars in the pigs is striking ; thus , pigs present an important potential source of human salmonellosis in Ibadan which can spread throug pork and other food products obtained from the animals ( Davies et al. 1999 ) . 
Manures from such farms can contaminate the environment ( Callaway et al. 2005 ) , water bodies , and vegetables . 
Notably , many of the farms including those sited close to rivers recklessly disposed the manures into the environment posing public health risk to grazing animals . 
The Salmonella serovars observed were generally the infrequent ones and differ from those commonly associated with pigs in developed countries and elsewhere ( Anonymous 2009 ; Kikuvi et al. 2010 ) . 
The prevalent serovars also differed from those earlier reported from Eastern Nigeria ( Amaechi and Ezeronye 2006 ) . 
These differences highlight the very complex nature and epidemiology of Salmonella from Africa and probably reflect differences in climate , culture , farming , feed , pig breeds , and biosecurity practices . 
The animals were fed indiscriminately with all kinds of unwholesome food remnants from households . 
Other food items such as dried cassava and banana peels , pawpaw leaves , and palm kernel cake were prepared and fed to the animals without adequate attention to food hygiene . 
The farms were poorly fenced with bushy environment coupled with general poor environmental sanitation making the animals vulnerable to Salmonella infection from sources in the environment ( Mascher et al. 1988 ; Briones et al. 2004 ; Wales et al. 2009 ) . 
The general level of hygiene in the farms was also poor which can also increase dissemination of infection . 
Those factors may be responsible for the diverse serovars observed . 
Although the serovars obtained in this study are generally not those commonly associated with human salmonellosis , they constitute potential public health importance because all Salmonella serotypes can infect humans depending on factors such as the age and immune status of individuals ( Aleksic et al. 1996 ) and such rare serovars are increasingly causing huma salmonellosis in the developed countries such as Canada , USA , and Europe ( Milstone et al. 2006 ; Bertrand et al. 2008 ) . 
For example , Salmonella Give caused a multistate outbreak in Germany in 2004 following consumption of raw minced pork with high hospitalization rate ( Jansen et al. 2005 ) . 
Additionally , such serovars are emerging public health concerns in Korea ( Kim 2010 ) . 
Similarly , in Ibadan , Nigeria , rarely isolated serovars including Salmonella Apapa , Salmonella Mouschaui , Salmonella Jukestown , and Salmonella Oritamerin caused invasive human salmonellosis ( Fashae et al. 2010 ) . 
Such serovars have also been reported in gastro-enteritis in Nigeria ( Mascher et al. 1988 ) . 
The prevalent of resistance to the old antimicrobial drugs ( sulfonamides , streptomycin , and tetracycline ) may be due to observed common usage of these drugs on farms . 
It is noteworthy that antimicrobial resistance was observed in several serovars and farms suggesting widespread of resistance . 
Multidrug resistance was however restricted to a few of the serovars suggesting differences in the relative ability to take up resistance genes . 
The prevalent multidrug resistance patterns were observed in Salmonella Give , Salmonella Kingston , Salmonella Nigeria , and Salmonella Kentucky . 
There are limited data about resistance of these serovars in literature probably because they are relatively uncommon . 
The isolation of Salmonella Kentucky suggests high selection pressure due to antimicrobials though some serovars are susceptible . 
Salmonella Kentucky is a new and emerging MDR serovar in Africa with poultry as reservoirs ( Le Hello et al

2011 ) . 
It is interesting to note that the Salmonella Kentucky strains were the most resistant and showed MDR to the same antimicrobials as the poultry strains suggesting dissemination in the food chain in Ibadan . 
The resistance of Salmonella Kentucky to ciprofloxacin coupled with the low-level cipro-floxacin resistance observed in Salmonella Derby , Salmonella Larochelle , and Salmonella Corvallis can compromise treatment of human salmonellosis ( Parry and Threlfall 2008 ; Collignon et al. 2009 ) . 
The lack of resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins indicates that these antimicrobials remain efficacious for treatment . 
The resistant Salmonella isolates were predominated by those from F3 and F4 . 
This may be explained by the relatively larger herds , common usage of antimicrobials , and ownership by the same company . 
The detection of qnr genes in some serovars could aid stepwise development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance ( Robicsek et al. 2005 ) and the genes could disseminate ( Garcia-Fernandez et al. 2009 ) . 
The detection of these genes in the pigs coupled with earlier report in poultry in Nigeria ( Fashae et al. 2010 ; Fortini et al. 2011 ) indicates widespread in food animals in the country . 
Pork obtained from those pigs would be of poor microbiological quality making export , particularly to developed countries , difficult and thus impacting negatively on the economy . 
The Nigerian government should therefore enforce control measures in the swine industry to safeguard public health to the benefit of people in both Nigeria and importing countries . 
Conclusion
Pigs constitute important potential source of human salmonellosis in Ibadan harboring highly diverse Salmonella serovars predominated by infrequently observed serovars such as Salmonella Give , Salmonella Brancaster , Salmonella Colindale , Salmonella Elisaberthville , and Salmonella Hillingdon which pose potential health hazards . 
The serovars varied in resistance to antimicrobials ; resistance to the old drugs was more common . 
The MDR serovars , particularly ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella Kentucky signify high antimicrobial selective pressure in some farms . 
Targeted control measures against the predominant serovars and regulation of antimicrobials are warranted .
