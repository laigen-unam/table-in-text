Genetic Characterization of the pnuC Gene, Which Encodes a Component of the Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Transport System in Salmonella typhimurium
NING ZHU , * BALDOMERO M. OLIVERA , AND JOHN R. ROTH Department of Biology , University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah 84112 Received 21 April 1989/Accepted 16 May 1989 
The pnuC gene , which encodes a component of the nicotinamide mononucleotide transport system , has been mapped and oriented . 
The gene order of the pnuC region , which is at min 17 of the Salmonella chromosome , is nadA-pnuC-aroG-gal . 
Polarity tests , with pnuC : : Mu d-lac operon fusions , reveal that the pnuC gene is the promoter distal gene in an operon with the nadA gene , which encodes the second enzyme of the pyridine biosynthetic pathway . 
The nadA pnuC operon is regulated by the NadI repressor . 
The pnuC gene also has its own promoter , since strains with a nadA : : TnlOd ( Tc ) insertion still express the pnuC gene at a low , unregulated level . 
The biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) in Salmonella typhimurium involves pathways for de novo synthesis and for pyridine nucleotide recycling ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The recycling pathways serve to regenerate NAD from nicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) , which is formed as a byproduct of DNA ligase activity and by as yet uncharacterized cellular processes ( 26 ) . 
The recycling pathways also allow cells to scavenge pyridine - from extracellular nicotinic acid ( NA ) , nicotinamide , NMN , and NAD . 
Exogenous NAD is not transported intact but is degraded extracellularly to NMN by an NAD pyrophosphatase ( 12 , 13 , 27 ) . 
Exogenous NMN is known to be utilized in two ways . 
It can be cleaved by an NMN glycohydrolase ( probably periplasmic ) to nicotinamide , which is taken up and converted to NAD by sequential action of the pncA , pncB , nadD , and nadE gene products ( 1 , 13 , 16 , 18 ) , or alternatively , it can be transported intact by the NMN transport system ( 8 , 15 , 21 , 22 , 30 ) . 
Direct transport of NMN , required for feeding a nadB pncA mutant , is inefficient and requires a high concentration of exogenous NMN ( 10 - ' M ) ( 15 ) ; utili-zation of NMN via the glycohydrolase ( for feeding a nadB pnuC mutant ) requires only 10 - M NMN . 
Several classes of NMN uptake mutants ( pnu ) have been isolated in S. typhi-murium . 
Among them , pnuB mutants have a more efficient uptake phenotype ; a pnuB mutation enables a nadB pncA mutant to grow on io-5 M NMN ( 22 ) . 
The other mutants , pnuA and pnuC , are all deficient in NMN transport . 
Neither the pnuA nor the pnuC mutation seems to affect the NMN glycohydrolase or NMN deamidase activity ( 15 , 21 , 30 ) . 
The two components of the NMN transport system are encoded by genes that map far apart on the chromosome . 
The pnuA gene maps at min 99 of the Salmonella chromosome adjacent to the nadI gene which encodes a repressor of the nadA and nadB genes of the NAD de novo pathway ( 8 , 14 , 17 , 34 ) . 
It is not yet clear whether the PnuA and NadI functions are encoded by a single gene or by two genes which form a single operon ( 8 , 14 , 34 ) . 
The pnuC gene maps near the pyridine biosynthetic gene , nadA . 
The nadA and pnuC genes have been cloned and both are included in a single 2.2-kilobase DNA fragment ( 31 ) . 
Spector et al. ( 30 ) suggested that pnuC maps to the upstream side ( left ) of the nadA gene and that the gene order of that region is pnuC-nadA-gal . 
The transcription of pnuC is regulated by the NadI ( NadR ) repressor as is nadA ( 30 ) . 
In this report , we describe the direction of transcription of the pnuC gene and present evidence that pnuC maps actually to the right of the nadA gene and that the two genes compose one operon . 
The transcription of pnuC is mainly from the nadA promoter . 
These results explain the coregulation of nadA and pnuC genes by the NadI repressor observed previously ( 30 ) . 
However , the pnuC gene also has its own weak but constitutive promoter , explaining why nadA insertion mutations retain PnuC function .

Difco agar was added at a final concentration of 1.5 % for solid medium . 
Nutrients to feed auxotrophs were included in minimal media at final concentrations described by Davis et al. ( 9 ) ; exceptions are indicated in the text . 
Antibiotics were added to media at the following final concentrations ( in micrograms per milliliter ) : ampicillin ( sodium salt ) , 30 in NB and 15 in E medium ; tetracycline hydrochloride , 20 in NB and 10 in E medium ; kanamycin sulfate , 50 in NB and 125 in E medium .

RESULTS
Isolation of NMN - mutants by Mu dJ transposon mutagenesis . 
Two types of NMN transport-deficient mutants ( pniuA , pnuC ) were reported previously ( 15 , 21 , 30 ) . 
In order to study the relationship between these two NMN transport genes and to examine the possibility that there may be more genes involved in the NMN transport process , mutants deficient in NMN utilization were isolated by Mu dJ insertion mutagenesis . 
The Mu dJ insertion mutants were isolated in a nadB pncA background . 
In this genetic background , mutants having a Mu dJ element inserted in any gene involved in NMN uptake or utilization would be unable to grow on i0 ' M NMN as a pyridine source . 
Thus , NMN deamidase mutants as well as NMN transport mutants could be detected ( Fig. 1 ) . 
A strain that has a TnJO insertion in nadB and a TnlOd ( Cm ) insertion in pncA ( TT13120 ) was used as the recipient for Mu dJ transposition by the cis complementation method described previously ( 20 ) . 
A total of 11 NMN mutants were found among approximately 50,000 Kmr col-onies . 
Since the pnuA and pnutC genes are closely linked to the serB and nadA genes , respectively ( 8 , 30 ) , all 11 NMN mutations were tested for linkage to the serB1463 : : TnlO the TT398 ) ( strain TT10120 ) or to nadA213 : : TnIO ( strain insertion . 
Five of them ( in strains TT13123 , TT13124 , TT13125 , TT13127 , and TT13130 ) were cotransduced with rest were the nadA gene at frequencies above 97 % . 
The cotransduced with the serB gene at a frequency of over 92 % . 
No other classes of mutants were found . 
All nadA-linked Mu dJ insertion mutants were phenotypically NadA + ; they did not cause auxotrophy when transduced into an otherwise wild-type strain . 
An NMN utilization gene maps to the right of nadA . 
The gene order of the pnuC region as determined by Spector et al. is pnuC-nadA-gal ( 30 ) . 
In view of this order , we were surprised to find that deletions extending from nadA to ga have a PnuC - phenotype ( are unable to use NMN as a source of pyridine ) . 
Two deletion mutants used ( strains TT15141 and TT15144 ) were obtained from R. Sonti : one ( TT15141 ) has an endpoint within the nadA gene and extends beyond the gal region ( i.e. , the downstream side of naidA was deleted [ R. Sonti , personal communication ] ) ; the other ( TT15144 ) removes the upstream end of the nadA gene . 
Although the size of this second deletion is unknown , it ha been shown that one deletion endpoint is within the nadA gene and the remaining downstream portion of the nadA gene is fused to an unknown promoter located to the left of the nadA gene ( R. Sonti , personal communication ) . 
When tested for growth on i0o4 M NMN , it was surprising to find that the mutant which deleted the upstream side of nadA was able to grow on l0o ' M NMN ( a PnuC + phenotype ) while the mutant which deleted the downstream side of nadA was not ( a PnuC - phenotype ) . 
Therefore , it was necessary to reexamine the gene order of this region . 
To do this , we isolated more deletion mutants of the nadA region by a method differing from that used to isolate DEL1079 and DEL1080 . 
Because of a lack of suitable markers , we were not able to identify more mutants which deleted the upstream side of the nadA gene . 
A TnJOd ( Tc ) insertion [ zbh-3652 : : TnlOd ( Tc ) ] was isolated as an insertion linked to nadA ( strain TT13651 ) . 
This TnlOd ( Tc ) maps to the right ( clockwise ) of nadA and between the aroG and gal genes based on a three-factor cross with an aroG : : Mu dJ insertion and a gal point mutation as references ( Fig. 2 ; see below ) . 
Deletion mutants which have one deletion endpoint inside the nadA gene were isolated by selecting Tcs mutants ( 2 , 23 ) in a strain that contains a nadA : : Mu dJ operon fusion and the zbh-3652 : : TnJOd ( Tc ) insertion ( TT13651 ) . 
Because the nadA gene is transcribed clockwise ( toward aroG and gal ) , it is possible to find mutants with deletions which remove the zbh-3652 : : TnJOd ( Tc ) element and the Kmr marker of the nadA : : Mu dJ element but do not extend into the lacZ gene of that element . 
The presence of half of the Mu dJ element ( the lac operon end ) at the deletion join point indicates that the promoterproximal portion of the nadA gene has not been deleted . 
These deletion mutants can be used to test whether there is an NMN utilization gene downstream of the nadA gene by testing growth on NMN as a pyridine source . 
The selection for Tcs mutants was done in the presence of X-Gal . 
A total of 800 blue colonies surviving the selection were screened for kanamycin sensitivity ( Kms ) . 
Five of the Kms Tcs isolates still formed blue colonies on an X-Gal plate ( one was TT14890 ) . 
The expression of the , B-galactosidase of these Kms Tcs Lac ' mutants is regulated by the concentration of NA as is that of the parental strain ( 8 ) . 
In addition , these mutants are all AroG - . 
The phenotypes indicate that , in these mutants , zbh-3652 : : TnlOd ( Tc ) , aroG , and the Km '' determinant of the nadA : : Mu dJ were deleted but that the lacZ gene fused to the nadA promoter was still present . 
None of these deletion mutants was able to grow on l0 ' - M NMN . 
This result suggests that there is an NMN utilization gene located clockwise ( on the downstream side ) of the nadA gene . 
More evidence comes from a similar experiment with a strain that is nadA + but carries the zbh-3652 : : TnJOd ( Tc ) and a Mu dJ insertion ( possibly in the pnuC gene ) that causes an NMN - phenotype . 
The Tcs derivatives were isolated and classified . 
Several types of mutants were found : ( i ) NadLac - Kms AroG - Tcs ; ( ii ) Nad + Lac - Kms AroG - Tcs , ( iii ) Nad ' Lac ' Kms AroG - Tcs , ( iv ) Nad + Lac ' Kmr AroG-Tcs , ( v ) Nad + Lac ' Kmr AroG + Tcs . 
The results , summarized in Fig. 2 , not only demonstrate that this NMN utilization gene maps between nadA and aroG but also provide information about the transcription orientation of this gene , which will be discussed later . 
NMN - insertion mutations in the nadA region are all located to the right of the nadA gene . 
Since we have not been able to analyze more well-defined deletion mutations on the upstream side of nadA , complementation analysis was used as an alternative method to test the possibility that some mutations might lie at the left of nadA and represent another class of NMN utilization deficiency . 
To do this , five independent NMN - Mu dJ insertions were tested for their chromosomal locations relative to the nadA gene by complementation tests . 
If any of these Mu dJ insertions is inserted in an independent NMN utilization gene on the left side of nadA , it will complement the NMN - deletion lying at the right of nadA . 
The complementation tests between each of the NMN - Mu dJ insertions and the NMN - deletion on the downstream side of nadA were performed with a strain containing a duplication covering the nadA region by a method described previously ( 34 ) . 
The NMN - deletion used was DEL1078 , which also deletes aroG . 
A tandem duplication which carries a TnlO element at its join point ( strain DUP1034 ) was introduced into the deletion mutant by selecting for inheritance of the TnWO element . 
This duplication covers the interval from pyrC ( 11 min ) to purE ( 23 min ) ( D. Hillyard , personal communication ) . 
The resultant strain ( TT15140 ) is diploid for the nadA region and homozygous for the NMN - deletion . 
Various NMN - Mu dJ insertions were transduced into this duplication strain with P22 lysates grown on the NMNMu dJ insertion strains .

TT11330 ) was included as a control . 
The Kmr AroG + transductants were presumed to carry the deletion in one copy of the duplication region and the insertion in the other . 
These heterozygotes were tested for growth on NMN ; all heterozygous strains ( TT14977 through TT14981 ) are phenotypically NMN - . 
A control strain heterozygous for the NMN - deletion and nadAS04 : : Mu dJ ( TT14982 ) is NMN + . 
The heterozygous state of these strains was verified by segregation tests . 
Both alleles , the NMN - deletion ( NMN-AroG - ) , and the NMN - Mu dJ insertion ( Kmr NMN-AroG + ) or nadA504 : : Mu dJ ( Nad - Kmr AroG + ) can be recovered among the segregants . 
The fact that all five NMN - Mu dJ insertions failed to complement the NMN - deletion mutant suggests that there is only one NMN utilization gene in the nadA region . 
We presumed that this is the pnuC gene reported by Spector et al. ( 30 ) . 
On the basis of our results , however , its actual location is clockwise of nadA . 
We will refer to our NMNMu dJ insertions as pnuC : : Mu dJ . 
The orientation of the pnuC gene . 
The direction of transcription of the pnuC gene has been determined in three ways . 
First , the data illustrated in Fig. 2 show that deletions from the aroG side extend into the pnuC gene from its promoter distal end , since some deletions affect the Kmr determinant of the pnuCJ04 : : Mu dJ insertion without preventing expression of the lacZ gene present in the Mu dJ element . 
Second , deletions which extend into the pnuC gene from the left ( nadA ) side were isolated from a strain containing a nadA : : TnJOd ( Tc ) pnuC : : Mu dJ ( Lac ' ) insertion ( strain TT13163 ) by selecting Tc ' derivatives in the presence of X-Gal . 
A total of 30 independent Lac - Tc5 Km ' mutants ( one of them is strain TT14895 ) were found among the total 212 white colonies tested . 
No Lac ' Km ' mutants were recovered among 900 blue Tc ' colonies . 
This result is consistent with the suggestion that the pnuC gene is transcribed clockwise , because if the deletions from the nadA side extend into the pnuC gene from its promoter side , it would be impossible to delete the Kmr determinant without deleting the intervening lacZ gene . 
Third , the orientation of the five pnuC : : Mu dJ insertions was tested by determining their ability to form deletions by recombining with nadA : : Mu dA insertions . 
This was done by constructing double mutants that carry both a pnuC : : Mu dJ ( Kmr ) and a nadA : : Mu dA ( Apr ) insertion . 
Such double mutants were constructed for all of the pnuC insertions with a nadA : : Mu dA insertion in both the fused ( designated B for blue colonies on X-Gal ) and the unfused ( designated W for white colonies on X-Gal ) orientations ( TT14900 through TT14908 ) . 
The possible structures of these double mutants are diagrammed in Fig. 3 for the double mutant combinations which showed segregants . 
Segregants lose drug can one resistance when homologous regions of the two insertions recombine to form a deletion . 
The two insertions share homology in the large lac region ( about 8.5 kilobases ) and in the smaller region of Mu homology ( about 1 kilobase ) ( 5 , 25 ) . 
The frequency of the segregant types reflects the sizes of these regions and indicates the relative order of these two Mu d insertions on the chromosome . 
Deletions were only seen for double mutants , in which both insertions are in the fused or unfused orientation ( A and B in ( Fig. 3A and B ) . 
No drug-sensitive segregants were seen if one insert was fused and the other unfused to a chromosomal promoter . 
Data ( examples given in Table 2 ) indicate that the two genes ( nadA and pnuC ) are ( i ) close together , ( ii ) located in the same orientation ( clockwise ) , and ( iii ) ordered so that pnuC is located at the promoter-distal end of the nadA gene . 
The nadA and pnuC genes form an operon . 
When the effect of NA concentration on the expression of pnuC : : lac fusions was tested , it was shown that the transcription of pnuC is repressed in the presence of a high concentration of NA ( 2 x i0 ' M ) and derepressed in the presence of a low concentration of NA ( 106 M ) ( e.g. , in strain TT13160 [ Table 3 ] ) . 
The pattern of regulation is the same as that of the nadA gene ( 8 , 14 , 17 , 34 ) . 
Since pnuC is highly linked to nadA , the transcriptional relationship between these two genes has been studied . 
The tests on nadA : : TnJOd ( Tc ) pnuC : : Mu dJ double mutants clearly show that nadA insertions prevent induction of pnuC : : lac fusions under derepressing conditions ( 10-6M

NA ) ( for an example , see the data for strain TT13161 shown in Table 3 ) . 
This is consistent with a nadA location upstream of pnuC in a single operon and with the orientation of pnuC described above . 
In order to distinguish between the possibilities that nadA insertions are polar to pniC and that the NadA function is required in trans for expression of the pnuC gene , double mutants were constructed which carry a nadA point mutation and a pnuC : : Mu dJ insertion . 
In these double mutants , expression of P-galactosidase is regulated just as it is in isogenic nadA + pnuC : : Mu dJ strains ( e.g. , TT14963 and TT14964 [ Table 3 ] ) , suggesting the NadA function is not required for the expression of pnuC . 
Furthermore , when a cloned plasmid containing the wild-type nadA gene was introduced into nadA : : TnJOd ( Tc ) pnuC : : Mu dJ ( Lac ' ) strains , the derivative strains ( TT14917 through TT14919 ) became NadA + but still expressed pnuC at a low , constitutively repressed level ( data not shown ) . 
We conclude that nadA insertions prevent pnuC induction because the nadA and pnuC genes form an operon with nadA located proximal to the promoter . 
The pnuC gene has its own weak and constitutive promoter . 
Since the nadA and pnuC genes are in an operon , nadA mutants , including both point and insertion mutants , wer

Deletion formation by homologous recombination between Mu dA and Mu dJ insertions in the same orientation . 
As a result of a homologous recombination , one Mu d insertion , as well as the sequence flanked by the two Mu d insertions , is deleted and the other Mu d insertion is left at the deletion join point . 
Since the lac sequence shared by Mu dA and Mu dJ elements ( Eli ) is longer than the shared Mu homology ( _ ) , the frequency of losing each drug resistance ( ED ) is determined by the order of Mu dA and Mu dJ . 
( A ) When the order of Mu dA and Mu dJ is such that the ampicillin resistance marker is flanked by the larger homologous region including the lac operons of the two Mu ds phages , the Apr determinant of Mu dA is preferentially deleted .

None of the nadA mutants tested is phenotypically NMN - , suggesting that , despite the presence of an upstream nadA insertion , pnuC is still expressed at a level sufficient to support growth on exogenous NMN . 
This basal level of expression is presumably caused by a secondary promoter located between nadA and pnuC . 
Further support of the existence of a secondary ( pnuC ) promoter was obtained from analysis of nadA : : TnlOd ( Tc ) pnuC : : Mu dJ double mutants . 
The data in Table 3 show that the nadA379 : : TnJOd ( Tc ) insertion is absolutely polar on a downstream nadA2J9 : : Mu dJ fusion ( strain TT14935 ) . 
The polarity effect of the same nadA : : TnJOd ( Tc ) insertion on a pnuCJ03 : : Mu dJ fusion is not complete . 
A low residual level of constitutive expression of the pnuCO03 : : lac fusion is seen despite the nadA : : TnJOd ( Tc ) insertion ( strain TT13161 in Table 3 ) . 
The expression of nadA is regulated by the NadI repressor ( 17 , 34 ) , which is encoded in a region that also encodes the PnuA function . 
We tested several types of mutations in the nadI-pnuA region for their effects on the expression of pnuC from either the nadA promoter or from the pnuC promoter . 
It is clear that the expression of pnuC from the nadA promoter , but not from the pnuC promoter , is regulated by the NadI repressor ( Table 4 ) . 
Mutations which eliminate the function pnuA but do not affect the NadI function have no effect on expression of the pnuC gene from either promoter ( Table 4 ) , nor do they affect nadA expression ( 8 ) . 
Thus , the NMN transport defect of pnuA mutants is not caused by a failure to express the pnuC gene .

DISCUSSION
Since a deletion mutant which lacks the downstream side of the nadA gene has an NMN utilization-deficient phenotype , we have investigated the possibility of an unknown NMN utilization gene located on the downstream side of nadA and the relationship between this gene and the pnuC gene reported by Spector et al. ( 30 ) . 
First , we have confirmed the existence of an NMN utili-zation gene on the downstream side of nadA by studying mutants with deletions in this region . 
Spontaneous deletions provide evidence that an NMN utilization gene maps between nadA and aroG . 
Second , a deletion mutant lacking the upstream end of the nadA gene has been shown to be NMN proficient . 
By complementation tests , we have shown that all of the five independent NMN - Mu dJ insertions we isolated in this region are located on the downstream side of nadA . 
In addition , the regulation of lac fusions in this NMN utilization gene is similar to that of the pnuC gene reported earlier ( 30 ) . 
We suggest that the NMN utilization gene affected by these insertions is the pnuC gene described by Spector et al. ( 30 ) and that the pnuC gene is actually located on the downstream side of the nadA gene . 
The transcriptional direction of the pnuC gene was also analyzed by using deletion mutants . 
Two lines of evidence indicate that transcription of the pnuC gene occurs in a clockwise orientation . 
First , deletions from the nadA side and from the aroG side extend into the pnuC gene from its promoter side and its terminator side , respectively . 
Second , generation of deletions between a nadA : : Mu dA insertion and a pnuC : : Mu dJ insertion occurs only if both insertions are either fused or unfused to the chromosomal promoter . 
Furthermore , polarity tests have demonstrated that the nadA and pnuC genes form an operon with nadA located promoter proximal . 
The fact that nadA insertions are not absolutely polar on pnuC leads to the identification of a separate pnuC promoter . 
The pnuC promoter differs from the nadA promoter by two characteristics , the low level of transcription and the lack of regulation . 
The nadA promoter is known to be regulated by a repressor coded by the nadI gene ( 17 , 34 ) . 
Although the nadI locus encodes an NMN utilization function ( PnuA ) , the PnuA function apparently has no effect on the expression of the pnuC gene . 
Thus , both a biosynthetic gene and a transport gene for pyridine appear to constitute an operon regulated in response to available pyridines . 
This seems physiologically reasonable , since both functions contribute to the endogenous level of pyridine nucleotides .
