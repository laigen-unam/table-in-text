In pathogenic bacteria , the two-component regulatory systems ( TCSs ) play important roles in signal transduction and regulation of their pathogenesis . 
Here , we used quantitative proteomic methods to comparatively analyze functional networks under the control of the RstA/RstB system versus the PhoP/PhoQ system in Salmonella typhimurium . 
By comparing the proteomic proﬁle from a wild-type strain to that from a ΔrstB strain or a ΔphoPQ strain under a condition known to activate these TCSs , we found that the levels of 159 proteins representing 6.92 % of the 2297 proteins identiﬁed from the ΔrstB strain and 341 proteins representing 14.9 % of the 2288 proteins identiﬁed from the ΔphoPQ strain were signiﬁcantly changed , respectively . 
Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the RstA/RstB system and the PhoP/PhoQ system coordinated with regard to the regulation of speciﬁc proteins as well as metabolic processes . 
Our observations suggested that the regulatory networks controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ system were much more extensive than those by the RstA/RstB system , whereas the RstA/RstB system speciﬁcally regulated expression of the constituents participating in pyrimidine metabolism and iron acquisition . 
Additional results also suggested that the RstA/RstB system was required for regulation of Salmonella motility and invasion .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of gastroenteritis and septicemia in humans . 
To survive in the host tissues , bacteria require the ability to sense host environmental signals and adapt accordingly by regulating various gene expression . 
This sensing and adaptation process often involves the two-component regulatory systems ( TCSs ) , which are the signal transduction systems widely spread in various bacteria [ 1 ] . 
A typical TCS consists of two proteins , a histidine sensor kinase , and a cognate response regulator . 
The sensor protein is located in the inner membrane , which senses certain environmental signals directly or indirectly , autophosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to activate its cytoplasmic cognate regulator , which in turn regulates transcription of speciﬁc genetic loci [ 2 ] .

The PhoP/PhoQ system is a master TCS to control Salmonella virulence . 
The known environmental signals that can activate PhoP/PhoQ include low Mg2 + , acidic pH , and cationic antimicrobial peptide ( CAMP ) [ 3,4 ] . 
The PhoP/PhoQ system also controls the expression of some other TCSs such as SsrA/SsrB [ 5 ] , PmrA/PmrB [ 6 ] , and RstA/RstB [ 7 ] . 
When the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated , it regulates the transcription of N100 genes [ 8 ] . 
It has been recently reported that in Salmonella , RstB , the histidine sensor kinase of RstA/RstB TCS , enhances the activity of PhoQ by increasing the transcription of PhoP-activated genes [ 9 ] . 
RstA , the cognate response regulator , is activated by the PhoP/PhoQ system under the condition of either low Mg2 + or acidic pH [ 10 ] . 
These studies suggest a coordinated regulation between the ` master regulator ' PhoP/PhoQ and the less known RstA/RstB system . 
The PhoP/PhoQ system has been the focus of many studies using system biology tools [ 11 -- 13 ] . 
However , no systematic proﬁling of the RstA/RstB-dependent regulatory network has been reported . 
To better understand the RstA/RstB regulation and its coordinated regulation with PhoP/PhoQ , we compared alterations of the proteome landscape caused by ΔrstB and ΔphoPQ mutations in S. typhimurium cultured under a known condition that activates PhoP/PhoQ and RstA/RstB ( i.e. , 10 μM Mg2 + ) [ 10,14 -- 16 ] . 
To carry out these analyses of quantitative proteomics , we used stable isotope dimethyl labeling and tandem mass spectrometry techniques . 
A total of 2297 and 2288 proteins were quantitated , and 159 and 341 proteins were found to b signiﬁcantly changed in the ΔrstB and ΔphoPQ strains , respectively . 
When comparing the RstA/RstB - and PhoP/PhoQ-regulated proteins , we identiﬁed similarities and differences between the two TCSs . 
Two , seven and two proteins related to pyrimidine metabolism , iron acquisition and cell motility ability , respectively , were found to be speciﬁcally regulated in the ΔrstB strain . 
Thus , our quantitative proteomic analysis provides a novel view on Salmonella pathogenesis regulation by means of TCS coordinated regulation .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions
A Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium wild-type strain ATCC 14028 was used for the study . 
The S. typhimurium ΔphoPQ strain was constructed as previously described [ 14,17 ] . 
Brieﬂy , the chloramphenicol ( Cm ) - resistant cassette from pKD3 was ampliﬁed using primer 5 ′ - AACGCTAGACTGTTCTTATTGTTAACACAAGGGAGAAGAGGTGTAGGCTG GAGCTGCTTC-3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGATGCTTAACGAGATGCGTGGAAGAACGCAC AGAAATGTATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCC-3 ′ . 
The resulting PCR product was electroporated into a S. typhimurium WT strain harboring pKD46 and integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination . 
The ΔphoPQ strain was then selected by the acquired chloramphenicol resistance and conﬁrmed by colony PCR . 
The ΔrstB : : Cm mutant was constructed similarly to the ΔphoPQ strain using the primers as follows : 5 ′ - AGCTAATGTATTGAGATCCGGT GGGCGTTGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3 ′ and 5 ′ - TCCCGCCGCTCAACCA GCGTGCAAAATGCGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3 ′ . 
The Δudp : : Km mutant was constructed using pKD4 as the template to amplify the kanamycin ( Km ) - resistant cassette with primers 5 ′ - ATGT CCAAGTCTGATGTTTTTCATCTCGGCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3 ′ and 3-TTACAGCAGACGACGGGCCGCTTCCACGACGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCT TC-5 ′ . 
P22 phage lysate was used to mediate the transfer of the ΔrstB : : Cm region into the Δudp : : Km mutant to construct the ΔrstB : : Cm Δudp : : Km double mutant . 
2.1.1. Plasmid construction
To construct plasmid pUHE21 , in which the RstB protein was expressed from the lac promoter , the rstB gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers pRstB-F / ( CGGGATCCGGTGGGCGTTGATGAAAAAGCTG ) , pRstB-Flag-R ( CCCCTGCAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCA GCGGTCATGTCGG ) and chromosomal DNA from the S. typhimurium strain as a template . 
After digestion with BamHI and PstI , the PCR products and plasmid pUHE21 were taped with T4 ligase at the corresponding restriction sites . 
Sequences of the cloned regions of the recombinant plasmids were conﬁrmed by nucleotide sequencing . 
2.1.2. Bacterial culture
The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in either Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium ( 10 g/l NaCl , 5 g/l yeast extract , and 10 g/l tryptone ) or N-minimal medium ( 5 mM KCl , 7.5 mM ( NH4 ) 2SO4 , 0.5 mM K2SO4 , 1 mM KH2PO4 , 0.1 M Tris-base , 38 mM glycerol , and pH 7.4 ) . 
For the `` low Mg2 + medium '' , N-minimal medium was supplemented with 10 μM MgCl2 . 
The bacteria were cultured at 9 h. 
2.2. Protein extraction
The bacterial cells from the late log growth phase were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 8 min and resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid calcium disodium salt ( EDTA ) and protease inhibitor cocktails ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
The cells were lysed by sonication in an ice water bath and then subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C . 
To precipitate the proteins , three volumes of a mixture of 50 % acetone , 50 % ethanol , and 0.1 % acetic acid were added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at − 40 °C . 
The protein pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in lysis buffer . 
The resuspended protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay . 
The extracted proteins were stored at − 80 °C . 
2.3. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
A two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 2D-PAGE ) was performed as we previously described [ 11 ] . 
Brieﬂy , dry polyacryl-amide gel strips with an immobilized pH gradient ( IPG ) in the pH range of 4 -- 7 and a size of 13 cm were used . 
A total of 450 μg protein was resuspended in rehydration buffer ( 7 M urea , 2 M thiourea , 2 % CHAPS , 0.0002 % bromophenol blue , 0.5 % pharmalyte , 20 mM dithiothreitol ) to a total volume of 250 μl . 
The resuspended proteins were applied to an IPG strip and allowed to rehydrate followed by isoelectric focusing for 18 h using the IPGphor system ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) . 
Subsequently , the IPG-strips were equilibrated with rotation in buffer A ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.8 ; 6 M urea , 30 % glycerol ; 2 % SDS and 1 % DL-dithiothreitol ( DTT ) for 10 min ) and then in buffer B ( the same as buffer A but with 2.5 % iodoacetamide replacing DTT ) for an additional 10 min . 
Each strip was then transferred on top of a 12 % polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension of the gel electrophoresis . 
Protein spots were visualized using Coomassie blue G-250 stain and then scanned . 
2.4. Protein digestion
The protein extract was resuspended in 8 M urea/0 .2 M Tris , pH 8/4 mM CaCl2 , reduced with 10 mM DTT at 50 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min . 
After diluting the urea concentration to 2 M with water , trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) was added ( 1:50 ; w/w , trypsin/protein ) and the proteins were digested at 37 °C overnight . 
The protein-containing 2D gel spots were excised and cut into small pieces . 
The gel slices were washed three times with 200 μl of 50 % aceto-nitrile/100 mM NH4HCO3 for 10 min each and dried by a SpeedVac . 
Then , the gel pieces were rehydrated with 100 μl of 10 mM NH4HCO3 , reduced with DTT , alkylated with iodoacetamide , and digested in gel with trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) as previously described [ 11 ] . 
2.5 . 
Peptide stable isotope dimethyl labeling and strong cation exchange fractionation 
The tryptic peptide mixtures were desalted using C18 Sep-Pak ( Waters ) before dimethyl labeling . 
The dimethyl labeling was performed as previously described [ 18 ] . 
Strong cation exchange ( SCX ) fractionation was performed using a PolySULFOETHYL Column ( 2.1 mm ID × 50 mm , 5 μm particle size , 200 Ǻ , PolyLC , Columbia , MD ) . 
SCX buffer A contained 5 mM KH2PO4 , pH 2.7 / 20 % acetonitrile/80 % H2O , and buffer B contained 5 mM KH2PO4 , 0.5 M KCl pH 2.7 / 20 % acetonitrile/80 % H2O . 
The peptide mixtures were dissolved in buffer A . 
The SCX was performed at a ﬂow rate of 0.2 ml/min . 
Six fractions were collected during the 55 min gradient . 
The peptides in each fraction were desalted using a C18 Ziptip ( Millipore ) before the mass spectrometry analysis . 
2.6. Mass spectrometry analysis and data processing
LC -- MS/MS experiments were performed using a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 UHPLC system ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) via a nanoelectrospray ion source . 
A chromatographic peptide separation was performed with a 25 cm column packed in-house with Uchrom 3 μm C18 resin in a 120 min gradient . 
The mobile phase consisted of two components : component A was 0.1 % formic acid , and component B was 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile 
Shotgun data were obtained by one full scan and up to 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans . 
The full-scan MS spectra were acquired across m/z 350 -- 1800 with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200 , a maximum injection time of 20 ms , and a target value of 3e6 . 
The precursors were isolated from a 1.6 m/z window , a ﬁxed ﬁrst mass of 100 m/z , and fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation ( collision energy 27 ) . 
The MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200 , a maximum injection time of 19 ms , and a target value of 1e6 . 
All of the raw LC -- MS/MS data were processed by MaxQuant version 1.5.2.8 software [ 19,20 ] and searched against the S. typhimurium proteome downloaded from the UniProt database . 
The false discovery rate ( FDR ) cut-off was set to 1 % at the level of both proteins and peptides . 
Proteins and peptides ( minimum seven amino acids ) were identi-ﬁed using a target-decoy approach with a reverse database . 
The workﬂow of quantifying dimethyl labeled peptides was set as follows : dimethLys0 , dimethNter0 for light labeling and dimethLys4 , and dimethNter4 for heavy labeling . 
For the other parameters , the default settings were used . 
For the peptide samples generated by in-gel digestion out of 2D gel spots , protein identiﬁcation was performed using a 4800 MALDI-TOF / TOF Proteomic Analyzer ( AB Sciex ) . 
Tryptic peptides were dissolved in 50 % acetonitrile/0 .1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , mixed with a CHCA ( α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ) ( 10 mg CHCA ml − 1 ) solution , and transferred to a sample plate . 
The peptide masses were collected over an m/z range of 800 -- 4000 Da . 
The proteins were identiﬁed using Mascot software ( http://www.matrixscience.com/ ) . 
The following search setting was used : peptide mass tolerance , ± 100 ppm ; fragment mass tolerance , ± 0.2 Da ; ﬁxed modiﬁcations , carbamidomethyl ( C ) ; variable modiﬁcations , oxidation ( M ) ; mass values , mono-isotopic ; protein mass , unrestricted ; max missed cleavages , 1 ; and enzyme , trypsin . 
The protein summary was reported for a signiﬁcance threshold p b 0.05 of accession , mass , score , and description . 
Parallel reaction monitoring ( PRM ) analyses were also performed using Q Exactive HF mass spectrometers [ 21 -- 24 ] . 
The peptides were eluted from the column with a 60 min gradient . 
The acquisition method combined two scan events : a full scan event and various numbers of PRM events targeting the manually selected precursor ions of peptides from the target proteins . 
The full scan event employed an m/z 300 -- 1200 mass range , a resolution of 15,000 ( at m/z 200 ) , a target AGC value of 3e6 , and maximum ﬁll times of 20 ms. The PRM event employed a resolution of 30,000 ( at m/z 200 ) , a target AGC value of 1e6 , and maximum ﬁll times of 100 ms. The precursor ion of each targeted peptide was isolated using a 1.6-m / z unit window . 
Based on the dimethyl labeling peptide of the MS/MS spectra library , at least three unique peptides with the highest intensity and the score of each protein were selected in the trial PRM experiment . 
PRM data were imported into the freely available Skyline software ( https://skyline.gs . 
washington.edu/labkey ) for signal extraction and quantiﬁcation [ 25 ] . 
One or two peptides from each protein and a minimum of three of the highest intensity product ions for each peptide were selected for subsequent PRM analysis . 
The ratio of each protein was normalized by the ratio of protein DnaK . 
2.7. Bioinformatics analysis
The protein ratios used in relative quantiﬁcation were calculated as previously described [ 26,27 ] . 
To identify the metabolic pathways and functional groups , which are signiﬁcantly altered in the proteome , list proteins were submitted to DAVID BIOINFORMATICS Resources 6.7 ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ ) through the KEGG PATHWAY database to identify metabolic pathways and to the PANTHER website ( http : / / www.pantherdb.org / ) to identify function groups . 
The `` statistical overrepresentation test '' was performed based on a PANTHER with p-value b0 .05 . 
In addition , heat maps and correlation tests were generated using Multi Experiment Viewer ( version 4.5.1 ) and Origin ( version 8.0 ) software , respectively . 
2.8. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) was performed as described previously [ 28 ] with minor modiﬁcations . 
Bacteria from an overnight culture were diluted 1:100 in fresh N-minimal media and grown at 37 °C for 9 h . 
After adjusting the bacteria to an OD600 of 1 , 1 ml of the culture was used for RNA isolation . 
The RNA was extracted with a total RNA puriﬁcation kit ( Zomanbio , catalog # ZP403-02 ) . 
The RNA solution was stored at − 80 °C until ready for use . 
For the cDNA construction , 0.5 μg of total RNA was used as templates to reverse transcribe the ﬁrst-strand cDNA with a high-capacity cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
A two-step run was used : step 1 was 5 min at 70 °C , step 2 was 60 min at 37 °C , and then followed by 15 min at 70 °C . 
The qRT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions on a CFX Manager Version 3.0 instrument ( Bio-Rad ) using SYBR mix ( Bio-Rad , iTaq ™ Universal SYBR Green Supermix , catalog # 172-5124 ) in a ﬁnal volume of 10 μl . 
The thermal cycling conditions were as follows : 94 °C for 30 s , followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s , 56 °C for 20 s , 72 °C for 15 s and 65 °C for 5 s ; the dissociation curve was 65 °C for 5 s and progressive temperature increases occurred until 95 °C . 
dnaK was ampliﬁed in each run as a control . 
The expression data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 6.0 software ( GraphPad Inc. , San Diego , CA ) . 
All of the quantitative real-time PCR was run with at least 3 replicates for all of the samples . 
2.9. Bacterial surface motility and invasion assay
A small amount ( 2 μl ) of overnight culture grown in LB was spotted onto the surface of a motility testing plate ( 0.3 % agar plates containing speciﬁed media ) . 
The plates were incubated at 28 °C for 16 h and the surface motility was determined by measuring the migration of the bacteria [ 29 ] . 
A bacterial invasion assay was performed as described previously [ 30,31 ] . 
Brieﬂy , the bacteria were cultured in LB overnight at 37 °C with shaking . 
The stationary-phase bacteria were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline ( PBS , pH 7.4 ) and resuspended in DMEM media . 
HeLa epithelial cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 . 
Conﬂuent monolayers of the cells were grown in 6-well plates 1 day before infection to reach approximately 3 × 105 cells per well . 
The cells were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS followed by the addition of fresh DMEM medium to each well 1 h prior to infection . 
The epithelial cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 50 . 
To increase the attack of the bacteria , the plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 for 90 min and then the surface bacteria were removed and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS . 
The 0 h time point ( T0 ) was taken by lysed cells with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C to release the intracellular bacteria , and then diluted 1000 times and plated on 1.5 % LB agar . 
The colonies were counted following overnight incubation at 37 °C . 
The remaining wells were incubated with fresh DMEM containing 100 μg / ml gentamicin to kill the extracellular bacteria for 90 min , and then the cells were lysed with 0.1 % Triton X-100 . 
The ly-sates were diluted 10 times and plated on LB as described above . 
The invasion rate of the HeLa cells was determined as the ratio between the number of bacteria that survived gentamicin treatment ( T90 ) and the number of input bacteria ( T0 ) . 
All of the experiments were performed with at least three replicates . 
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quantitative proteomic strategy and data overview
To study a possible coordinated regulation between the RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ systems , we generated a deletion mutant strain for rstB ( ΔrstB ) and a deletion mutant strain for phoP/PhoQ ( ΔphoPQ ) . 
We then examined the growth rate of these mutant strains . 
When the Mg2 + concentration in the media was kept at 10 mM ( not unde 
Mg2 + restriction ) the ΔrstB and ΔphoPQ strains yielded a similar growth curve as that of the wild-type strain ( data not shown ) . 
However , when cultured under the low Mg2 + condition ( 10 μM ) ( a condition known to activate PhoP/PhoQ and RstA/RstB ) , the ΔrstB strain yielded similar growth curve as that of the wild-type strain , whereas the growth curve of the ΔphoPQ strain was different and showed reduced growth after approximately 6.5 h of culturing ( Fig. 1A ) . 
These data on growth behavior indicate that the ΔrstB and ΔphoPQ strains have a different level of sensitivity to the low Mg2 + condition and the ΔrstB strain is less affected . 
To systematically study coordinated regulation between the RstA / RstB and PhoP/PhoQ systems , we performed a quantitative proteomic proﬁling of S. typhimurium under the regulation of these two TCSs . 
The proteomic workﬂow is outlined in Fig. 1B . 
The ΔrstB , ΔphoPQ , and wild-type strains were cultured under a low Mg2 + condition ( 10 μM ) for 9 h , and the bacterial proteins were extracted . 
After digesting the proteins by trypsin , the tryptic peptides were labeled with either a `` light '' or `` heavy '' dimethyl group ( peptides of WT were labeled with the `` light '' , whereas the ΔrstB or ΔphoPQ strain was labeled with the `` heavy '' reagent ) . 
Then , the labeled peptides were mixed in a 1:1 ratio ( mix 1 : ΔrstB / WT as H/L ; mix 2 : ΔphoPQ / WT as H/L ) , separated into ﬁve fractions by SCX and subjected to LC -- MS/MS analysis for protein identiﬁcation and quantitation ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Three independent biological replicates were performed for each of the two quantitative proteomic experiments ( ΔrstB / WT and ΔphoPQ / WT ) . 
A total of 13,498 , 18,432 , and 20,301 peptides for the ΔrstB / WT mix and 18,919 , 18,618 , and 17,287 peptides for the ΔphoPQ / WT mix were identiﬁed from three biological replicates ( FDR b 1 % ) . 
After removing the proteins , they contain only a single unique peptide and proteins lack dimethyl ratio information . 
A total of 1624 , 2046 , and 2193 proteins from the ΔrstB / WT mix and 2106 , 2065 , and 2011 proteins from the ΔphoPQ / WT mix were quantiﬁed in the three biological replicates ( Fig. 1C -- D , Supplemental Table S1 ) . 
When the quantiﬁed proteins from the three replicates were combined , in the ΔrstB / WT mix , a total of 2297 proteins were identiﬁed , and 1587 proteins ( 69 % ) overlapped between the three replicates ( Fig. 1C ) . 
In the ΔphoPQ / WT mix , a total of 2288 proteins were identiﬁed , and 1844 proteins ( 80 % ) overlapped between the three replicates ( Fig. 1D ) . 
The shared proteins from the three replicates were used to evaluate the data correlation . 
For the ΔrstB / WT mix , Pearson correlation coefﬁcient values of 0.80 , 0.62 and 0.67 were obtained ( Supplemental Fig . 
S1A ) . 
For the ΔphoPQ / WT mix , Pearson correlation coefﬁcient values of 0.89 , 0.90 , and 0.87 were obtained ( Supplemental Fig . 
S1B ) . 
From the quantitative protein ratio information of the ΔrstB / WT mix and the ΔphoPQ / WT mix , the signiﬁcantly changed proteins may be regulated directly or indirectly by the RstA/RstB or PhoP/PhoQ systems . 
To deﬁne the signiﬁcantly changed proteins , the normal ( or Gaussian ) distribution of the log2 protein ratios was determined . 
In regard to the mean and standard deviation ( S.D. ) value of the Gaussian distribution [ 32 ] , if deﬁning the mean ± 1.96 S.D. as a signiﬁcantly changed threshold , for ΔrstB / WT , the up-regulated ( RstA/RstB repressed ) and downregulated ( RstA/RstB activated ) ratio cutoffs were determined as 1.48 and 0.73 ( Fig. 1E ) , respectively , and for ΔphoPQ / WT , the up-regulated ( PhoP/PhoQ repressed ) and down-regulated ( PhoP/PhoQ activated ) ratio cutoffs were determined as 2.51 and 0.34 ( Fig. 1F ) , respectively . 
Based on the above cutoff threshold values , 6.92 % ( 97 up - and 62 down-regulated ) and 14.9 % ( 82 up - and 259 down-regulated ) of identi-ﬁed proteins were signiﬁcantly changed for the ΔrstB / WT and the ΔphoPQ / WT , respectively ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . 
Because there were 259 down-regulated ratio cutoffs in the ΔphoPQ / WT versus 62 down-regulated in ΔrstB / WT , these data reveal that under the low Mg2 + condition , PhoP/PhoQ activated 4 times the amount of proteins than the RstA/RstB system .

The up-regulated cutoff for ΔrstB / WT was 1.48 , and the down-regulated cutoff was 0.73 ( E ) . 
The up-regulated cutoff for ΔphoPQ / WT was 2.51 , and the down-regulated cutoff was 0.34 ( F ) 
3.2. Comparison of RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ regulated proteins
To determine which metabolic pathways are regulated by RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ systems , we examined the identiﬁed proteins with a bioinformatics analysis using the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp ) [ 33,34 ] . 
In total , 80 and 85 metabolic pathways were annotated for ΔrstB / WT and ΔphoPQ / WT ( p b 0.05 ) , respectively , with a total of 80 pathways in common ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . 
We also manually calculated the average protein ratios for each common pathway and the results are presented in Fig. 2A . 
Among these shared pathways , we found that although ΔphoPQ showed more effects than ΔrstB , only in one metabolic pathway , the biosynthesis of the siderophore nonribosomal peptide ( NRPS ) pathway ( stm01053 ) , did ΔrstB elicit the opposite effects than that of ΔphoPQ ( down-regulated , in the ΔrstB / WT ) ( Fig. 2B ) . 
To determine which biological processes were signiﬁcantly affected by the rstB and phoPQ mutations , we submitted the list of altered proteins ( up - and down-regulated proteins ) to a ` statistical overrepresentation test ' . 
The Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships ( PANTHER ) server website ( http://www.pantherdb.org/ ) offers a tool that compares the input proteins ' list with the reference protein sources by calculating the variance between the expected and actually observed protein numbers . 
The test determines whether the expected protein number of a certain biological process in the test list is considered a statistical overrepresentation or underrepresentation [ 35 ] . 
These test results showed that among the RstA/RstB regulated group , 6 biological processes ( BP ) were overrepresented , whereas only one ( unclassiﬁed ) was underrepresented ( Table 1 ) . 
Among the PhoP/PhoQ regulated group , 20 biological processes were overrepresented and only one was underrepresented ( Table 1 ) . 
All 6 overrepresented biological processes observed in the RstA/RstB regulated group were also observed in the PhoP/PhoQ regulated group , which suggests that the RstA/RstB regulation somewhat overlapped with the PhoP/PhoQ regulation and

PhoP/PhoQ signiﬁcantly affected more biological processes . 
Clearly , our data indicate that compared to RstA/RstB system , the PhoP/PhoQ system is a master regulator . 
The above tests indicate that all of the overrepresented biological processes associated with the RstA/RstB system were also overrepresented in the PhoP/PhoQ system , but it is not clear at the protein level which proteins are commonly regulated and which ones are differentially regulated among the two TCSs . 
To answer these questions and to differentiate the RstA-regulation from the PhoP-regulation , we systematically compared the RstA-regulated proteins with that of their PhoP-regulated counterparts ( Fig. 2C -- E ) . 
Between the two groups , there are eight proteins each that were either repressed ( Fig. 2C ) or activated by both TCSs ( Fig. 2D ) . 
However , there were 15 RstA/RstB repressed proteins that were activated by PhoP/PhoQ ( Fig. 2E ) , whereas 74 RstA / RstB-repressed proteins and 54 RstA/RstB-activated proteins were unchanged under PhoP/PhoQ regulation ( Fig. 2F ) . 
Among the 8 proteins repressed by both RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ ( Fig. 2C ) , there were four ribosomal proteins ( RpmB , RpsT , RpsO , and RplY ) and two primary metabolic process related proteins ( FabZ and TtcA ) . 
The FabZ protein is a dehydratase for fatty acid biosynthesis [ 36 ] , and TtcA is required for thiolation of cytosine 32 of tRNA and the oxygen-sensitive Fe-S cluster [ 37 ] . 
These results suggest that both RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ systems may negatively regulate peptide synthesis and some metabolic processes . 
Among the 8 activated proteins shared by both mixes ( Fig. 2D ) , two proteins , PagK , and OmpC are known PhoP-activated proteins [ 13 ] . 
Therefore , the RstA/RstB system can indeed activate a portion of the PhoP/PhoQ activated proteins . 
Furthermore , a known RpoS-regulated gene product , SpvC from spvRABCD operon [ 38 ] , was characterized in activation proﬁle shared by both mixes ( Fig. 2D ) . 
Since PhoP is a transcriptional activator of the iraP ( yaiB ) gene that controls RpoS protein turnover by interacting with RssB [ 39 ] , we postulate that the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA/RstB systems might coregulate iraP to control RpoS , and therefore regulate spvRABCD .

Protein spots that correlated with the differentially expressed Udp and Cdd proteins are marked . 
( C ) Both Udp and Cdd participate in pyrimidine metabolism . 
Cdd is involved in the scavenging of exogenous and endogenous cytidine and deoxycytidine creating uridine and deoxyuridine . 
Udp catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis cleavage of uridine , deoxyuridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate ( Ri-1-P ) . 
Following the conversion of Ri-1-P to Ri-5-P , Ri-5-P can lead to the pentose phosphate cycle 
Among the proteins repressed by RstA/RstB but activated in PhoP/PhoQ ( Fig. 2E ) , PagP is a PhoP-activated protein that is involved in lipid A bio-synthesis in Salmonella [ 40 ] . 
BaeS and SsrA ( SpiR ) are sensor histidine kinases of TCSs BaeS/BaeR and SsrA/SsrB , respectively [ 41,42 ] . 
Therefore , it seems that RstA/RstB may counterbalance the activation effects of PhoP/PhoQ in selected processes . 
Finally , we also noticed that there were a group of proteins that were repressed or activated by RstA / RstB regulation but unchanged by PhoP/PhoQ regulation ( Fig. 2F ) . 
This group includes the two most signiﬁcantly repressed proteins in RstA / RstB regulation : Udp ( uridine phosphorylase , or UPase ) and Cdd ( the cytidine deaminase ) , both of which are up-regulated by ~ 9-fold and are involved in pyrimidine metabolism . 
Six proteins in this group are involved in iron acquisition and 2 proteins are related to cellular motility ( more about these proteins is presented below ) . 
3.3. RstA/RstB regulation of pyrimidine metabolism
Under the low Mg2 + condition , two of the most signiﬁcantly RstA / RstB repressed proteins were the Udp ( uridine phosphorylase or UPase ) and Cdd ( the cytidine deaminase ) proteins ( both up-regulated by ~ 9-fold ) . 
In contrast , these two proteins did not change under PhoP/PhoQ regulation . 
In an independent 2D-PAGE analysis , deletion of rstB that led to the up-regulation of Udp and Cdd was also evident ( Fig. 3A and B ) . 
In the 2D-gel generated from the ΔrstB strain grown in the low Mg2 + condition , spots `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' were identiﬁed as Udp and Cdd proteins ( Fig. 3B ) . 
However , in the matching 2D-gel generated from the WT strain , the corresponding spots were mostly missing

3.4. RstA/RstB regulation of iron acquisition
Enterobactin ( also known as enterochelin ) are high-afﬁnity siderophores that acquire iron for microbial systems . 
Our results indicated that the levels of EntA , EntB , EntE , EntF , and MenF , the proteins that are required for siderophore synthesis , were downregulated in the ΔrstB strain , but remained unchanged in the ΔphoPQ strain ( Fig. 2B ) . 
However , two other iron transporter proteins , FeoA and FeoB , were repressed by RstA/RstB system and independent from the PhoP/PhoQ system . 
To conﬁrm the regulation of these siderophore enzymes ( EntA , EntB , EntE , and EntF ) and the iron transporters ( FeoA and FeoB ) , we used another quantitative proteomic method , PRM , to measure the relative quantity of these proteins in the ΔrstB strain versus the wild-type strain . 
Speciﬁcally , we used two-plex dimethyl labeling for quantifying the peptides from the wild-type strain and ΔrstB strains labeled with light and medium dimethyl-groups ( i.e. , 4 Da heavier than that in the WT ) . 
The PRM results showed that FeoA and FeoB were upregulated in the ΔrstB strain , whereas EntA and EntE were downregulated in the ΔrstB strain . 
These PRM results were consistent with those obtained from LC -- MS/MS-based quantitation results ( Fig. 4A -- D and Table 2 ) . 
The qRT-PCR analysis showed that compared to the wild type , the gene expression of entA , entB , entE and entF in the ΔrstB strain was reduced approximately 0.5 -- 0.6-fold but increased 1.6 -- 1.7-fold for feoA and feoB ( Table 2 ) . 
These results demonstrate that the regulation of these iron acquisition-related proteins occurred at the gene expression level . 
The acquisition of metal ions is essential for bacterial survival and development . 
Iron is an abundant element in the environment and an essential element required for many biological processes in all microorganisms . 
Previous studies indicate that in Salmonella , the uptake of ferrous iron ( Fe2 + ) and ferric iron ( Fe3 + ) occurs by different mechanisms , the transporter feo system is related to ferrous iron [ 44 ] and ferric iron acquisition is mediated by enterobactins , which are high-afﬁnity siderophores [ 45 -- 47 ] . 
Pathogenic bacteria can acquire iron from other living organisms using enterobactins even though the concentration of iron is kept extremely low due to the toxicity of free iron . 
Here , we showed that the RstA/RstB system regulated iron uptake . 
On the other hand , a recent proteomic study from our group showed that PhoP / PhoQ might serve as a repressor of iron uptake proteins [ 18 ] , suggesting that deletion of this system caused iron overload . 
It has been well established that PhoP/PhoQ activation leads to the increase of several magnesium transporters ( e.g. , MgtA and MgtB ) [ 13,16 ] , and a mutant defective in phoP or in both mgtA and mgtB is hypersensitive to Fe2 + , but not Fe3 + [ 48 ] . 
Because proteins in the biosynthesis of the siderophore nonribosomal peptide ( NRPS ) pathway ( stm01053 ) showed a different regulation trend between the ΔrstB and the ΔphoPQ strains ( Fig. 2B ) , we speculated that the RstB protein might play a role in elevating the level of enterobactin proteins to increase the acquisition of ferric iron ( Fe3 + ) . 
We determined the bacterial survival when they encounter iron challenge , and found that 37 % of the ΔrstB mutant cells survived whereas 85 % of the wild-type strain could live after treated by 0.1 mM ferric ion ( Fig. 5A ) . 
This Fe3 + - mediated killing was conﬁrmed by supplementation of deferoxamine mesylate ( def ) because the ΔrstB mutant cells were rescued by this ferric scavenger ( 0.3 mM ) in the presence of FeCl3 ( Fig. 5A ) .

( Fig. 3A ) . 
The locations of these two proteins on the 2D-gel correlated well with their predicted molecular weight and isoelectric points , which indicated the existence of full-size proteins . 
Both Udp and Cdd play important roles in pyrimidine metabolism . 
Cdd involves the scavenging of exogenous and endogenous cytidine and deoxycytidine , which creates uridine and deoxyuridine ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Udp catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis cleavage of uridine , deoxyuridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate ( Ri-1-P ) . 
Following the conversion of Ri-1-P to ribose-5-phosphate ( Ri-5-P ) , Ri-5-P can lead to the pentose phosphate cycle ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Hence , Udp is used to maintain ATP energy sources and plays a key role in the `` clearance '' of excess uridine in the organism to achieve the optimal concentration . 
Uridine concentrations under the physiological condition in almost all organisms are 4 -- 6 μM [ 43 ] . 
When the concentration of uridine increases , de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis will be blocked [ 43 ] . 
Our proteomic data show that Udp and Cdd proteins were negatively regulated by RstA / RstB under the low Mg2 + condition , which suggests that RstA/RstB may play a role in balancing uridine concentration and supplying an intermediate for the pentose phosphate cycle .

The RstA/RstB system contributes to the regulation of surface motility and invasion 
Based on our proteomic study , two proteins , FlhA ( ﬂagellar biosynthesis protein ) and MglB ( galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter substrate-binding protein ) , were shown to be activated by RstA/RstB regulation ( Fig. 2F ) . 
FlhA and MglB are both involved in cell motility and chemotaxis . 
To test the effects of ΔrstB and ΔphoPQ mutation on bacterial motility , we performed cell motility assays under low and high Mg2 + conditions . 
The results showed that under both conditions , the ΔrstB strain shows a signiﬁcant reduction in motility comparison to the WT strain , whereas the ΔphoPQ strain shows similar motility as that of the WT strain ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Adherence and invasion are the initial steps in bacterial infection [ 30 ] . 
To investigate if reduced motility in the ΔrstB strain could lead to decreased ability in the invasion , we performed an invasion assay for the ΔrstB strains using HeLa cells . 
A more than three-fold reduction was observed in the ΔrstB strains when compared to the wild type ( Fig. 5C ) . 
Because Udp was the most signiﬁcantly repressed ( up-regulat-ed ~ 9-fold ) protein in the ΔrstB strains , we tested whether the Udp protein was linked to invasion reduction in the ΔrstB strain . 
We generated a ΔrstB Δudp double mutant strain and tested its invasion ability . 
Our results showed that the ΔrstB Δudp double mutant strain had the same level of invasion capability as that of the ΔrstB strain . 
Therefore , Udp is unlikely involved in the invasion reduction . 
Because very few invasion-associated proteins were quantiﬁed in our proteomic data due to low abundance , we therefore examined the expression of several invasion-related genes by qRT-PCR . 
The results show that in the ΔrstB strain , the expression of several invasion-associated genes , such as invA , invF , invG and orgB [ 49 ] , was down-regulated compared to the wild type ( Fig. 5D ) . 
Therefore , RstA/RstB can activate invasion through the regulation of invasion-related genes . 
4. Conclusion
In this study , using dimethyl labeling-based quantitative proteomic methods , we investigated and compared the Salmonella proteome under the regulation of the RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ systems . 
We found that although both RstA/RstB and PhoP/PhoQ regulate some common proteins and metabolic processes , the PhoP/PhoQ system 's regulatory network is much more extensive . 
Only in one pathway , the biosynthesis of the siderophore nonribosomal peptide ( NRPS ) pathway ( stm01053 ) did the ΔrstB elicit opposite effects than that of ΔphoPQ ( down-regulated in the ΔrstB / WT ) ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Our data also indicate that independent of PhoP/PhoQ , the RstA/RstB system may play important roles in the regulation of pyrimidine metabolism , iron acquisition and bacterial motility and invasion .
