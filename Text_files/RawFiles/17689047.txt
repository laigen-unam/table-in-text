Abstract 
Previously , we reported the phenomenon of genome diversification in Salmonella typhimurium LT7 , i.e. , individual strains derived from LT7 kept changing the genome structure by inversions , translocations , duplications , and mutations . 
To elucidate the genetic basis , we sequenced selected genes of the mismatch repair ( MMR ) system for correlations between MMR defects and genome diversification . 
We chose S. typhimurium LT7 mutants 8111F2 and 9052D1 for mut gene sequence analyses and found that both mutants had a deletion of one of three tandem 6-bp repeats , GCTGGC GCTGGC GCTGGC , within mutL , which was designated 6 bpΔmutL . 
mutS and mutH genes were unchanged in the mutants analyzed . 
Some sublines of 8111F2 and 9052D1 spontaneously stopped the genome diversification process at certain stages during single-colony restreaking passages , and in these strains the 6 bpΔmutL genotype also became wild-type mutL . 
We conclude that conversion between mutL and 6 bpΔmutL occurs spontaneously and that transient defects of mutL facilitate genome diversification without leading to the accumulation of multiple detrimental genetic changes . 
Spontaneous conversion between mutL and 6 bpΔmutL may be an important mechanism used by bacteria to regulate genetic stability in adaptation to changing environments .

Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae , such as those in the genera Salmonella and Escherichia , usually have stable genome structures as revealed by physical mapping [ 1,2 ] and sequencing [ 3 -- 9 ] . 
However , in a previous study , we found that archival strains of Salmonella typhimurium LT7 , stocked at room temperature in agar stabs for about 4 decades , had diversifying genomes , i.e. , individual strains had kept changing the genome structure , leading to mixtures of cells with differently organized genomes [ 10 ] . 
However , the genetic basis of this phenomenon remained unknown . 
S. typhimurium LT7 was reported to have a defect in a gene , responsible for an increase in mutation frequency for many loci [ 11 ] . 
The defective gene , or mutator locus , was initially mapped to a genomic region near and upstream of thr [ 12 ] and was later characterized as part of the mismatch repair ( MMR ) system , which plays a key role in maintaining genetic stability by correcting DNA biosynthetic errors [ 13 -- 16 ] . 
The basic components in MMR are conserved from bacteria to humans . 
Three proteins in the MMR system , MutS , MutL , and MutH , are important for initiating the mismatch repair process . 
MutS is an ATPase that recognizes and binds to mismatched regions of DNA . 
MutL is also an ATPase and acts as a coordinator between MutS and MutH . 
MutH is a sequence-specific and methyl-dependent endonuclease that cleaves the newly synthesized an transiently unmethylated daughter strand , thus initiating MMR [ 17 ] . 
Bacteria having defects in MMR , like S. typhimurium LT7 , are mutators . 
Cells of mutators have elevated rates of spontaneous mutation [ 18,19 ] and recombination [ 15 ] . 
The frequency of mutators in natural Escherichia coli and Salmonella populations is approximately 1 % [ 18,20 ] . 
Sniegowski et al. found that 3 of 12 E. coli cultures founded from a single cell and propagated for 10,000 generations under glucose-limiting conditions became mutators [ 19 ] , with one mutator strain resulting from the insertion of a single base pair in mutS and the other two from an alteration in the copy number of a 6-bp repeat sequence in mutL [ 21 ] . 
To determine the genetic basis responsible for genome structure diversification in S. typhimurium LT7 and its potential biological significance , we attempted to detect and characterize the defects of MMR in S. typhimurium LT7 by sequencing and comparing the mutL , mutS , and mutH genes of representative archival strains of S. typhimurium LT7 . 
We found that the mutS and mutH genes were unchanged but mutL had a 6-base deletion in many , but not all , of the strains . 
We discuss the possible roles of mutL in bacterial genome diversification and evolution .

Results
Genome structure and sequences of mutL , mutS , and mutH of wild-type S. typhimurium strains 
Wild-type S. typhimurium LT7 showed uniform colonies on LB plates , suggesting uniform genome structure as well , as bacterial cells with changed genome structures may exhibit different colony morphologies [ 10 ] . 
For comparison , we also streaked S. typhimurium LT2 , which is not a mutator , onto LB plates . 
Like wild-type LT7 , LT2 showed uniform colonies . 
As anticipated , both LT7 and LT2 wild-type strains had normal genome structures ( Table 1 ) . 
We then determined the sequences of mutL , mutS , and mutH genes for LT7 and LT2 wild-type strains . 
Using the primers listed in Table 2 , we sequenced the mutL gene . 
The locations of the primers on mutL are shown in Fig. 1 . 
The sequences thus determined were identical to the mutL gene of the sequenced S. typhimurium LT2 genome ( NC_003197 .1 ) [ 6 ] . 
We then sequenced the mutS and mutH genes , and no differences were found between the LT7 and the LT2 strains either . 
These results suggest at least two possibilities : ( 1 ) the mutator genotype of LT7 may not involve the mutS , mutH , or mutL genes and ( 2 ) as a mutator , S. typhimurium LT7 may contain a mixture of cells , some but not all of which may have defects in mutS , mutH , or mutL . 
To distinguish these two possibilities , we would have to sequence more genes or screen very large numbers of colonies to catch the cells with mutator genotypes . 
To make a simple start , we focused directly on representative LT7 mutants that had been known to have diversified genome structures , including derivatives of LT7 mutants 8111 ( met-115 ) and 9052 ( ser-85 ) [ 10 ] , with LT2 mutants that had similar genotypes and phenotypes , 8312 ( met-329 ) and 9083 ( ser-116 ) , respectively , being included as controls .

b All examined 8111F231xx ( x ) strains have the wild_type mutL , including 8111F23112 , 8111F231213 , 8111F231232 , 8111F231233 , 8111F23131 , 8111F23132 , 8111F23141 , and 8111F23143 . 
Genome structure and gene sequences of mutL, mutS, and mutH of S. typhimurium mutant strains
Upon first plating after being stocked for 4 decades , LT7 mutant strain 8111 gave rise to colonies of diverse sizes . 
We used the letters A , B , C , D , E , and F to indicate the size ( diameter ) ranges of colonies after incubation for 36 h at 37 °C as follows : A , N4 mm ; B , 2 to 4 mm ; C , 1 to 2 mm ; D , 0.5 to 1 mm ; E , 0.3 to 0.5 mm ; and F , b0 .3 mm . 
Wild-type LT7 and LT2 formed B-sized colonies . 
When the single colonies were streaked on a fresh plate , the resulting colonies again showed different sizes ; from this time point on , we designated colonies of different sizes with numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , instead of A , B , C , D , E , and F , respectively . 
So , 8111A , 8111B , 8111C , 8111D , 8111E , and 8111F in turn had large to increasingly small colonies , each of which again gave rise to colonies of different sizes . 
For example , strain 8111F was a small-colony former ( hence `` F '' ) on the first plating , which gave rise to 8111F2 , among others , that form from large to small colonies . 
From 8111F2 , we in turn obtained colonies that led to sublines of cells forming large ( e.g. , 8111F23111 , 8111F23121 , etc. ) , mediumsized ( e.g. , 8111F24342 , 8111F24343 , etc. ) , and small ( e.g. , 8111F24334 , 8111F24345 , etc. ) colonies . 
Most of them ha indistinguishable endonuclease cleavage patterns compared with the wild-type LT7 , but bacterial cells from approximately 5 % of the colonies screened had noticeably different cleavage patterns ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Like the 8111 series , some of the 9052 descendants also formed different-sized colonies and different endonuclease cleavage patterns reflecting possibly different genome structures ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In contrast , LT2 mutants 8312 and 9083 did not show any variation in colony size or endonuclease cleavage pattern ( data not shown ) . 
We then determined the sequences of mutL , mutS , and mutH for one representative mutant of the LT7 8111 series , 8111F2 , and one of the 9052 series , 9052D1 ; for comparison , we also sequenced these genes for LT2 mutants 8312 and 9083 . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , both 8111F2 and 9052D1 had a 6-bp deletion within the mutL gene , which was one of three 6-bp tandem repeats , GCTGGC GCTGGC GCTGGC , from nucleotide residue 4601893 to 4601910 of the LT2 genome ; we designate mutL having the 6-bp deletion 6 bpΔmutL . 
The sequences of the mutS and mutH genes of 8111F2 and 9052D1 had no change compared with those of the sequenced genome of S. typhimur-ium LT2 ( NC_003197 .1 ) [ 6 ] . 
LT2 mutants 8312 and 9083 had normal mutL , mutS , and mutH sequences compared with the sequenced genome of LT2 [ 6 ] .

Spontaneous conversion of 6 bpΔmutL to mutL and stabilization of genome structure
A puzzling phenomenon remained to be elucidated in our previous work on genomic diversification of S. typhimurium LT7 [ 10 ] , that is , some archival LT7 mutants kept diversifying the genome structure , whereas some other LT7 mutants stopped genome structure diversification at a certain stage . 
This pheno-menon was best demonstrated and exemplified by LT7 mutants of the 8111 and 9052 series ( Fig. 2 ) , so we focused on deri-vatives of these mutants to explore the genetic basis of this phenomenon . 
We picked up one representative single colony each from 8111A , B , C , D , E , and F ( see above for colony size designation by the letters A through F ) and analyzed their genome structures ; bacterial cells from different-sized colonies tended to have diverse genome structures ( Table 1 ) . 
Based on the findings that LT7 mutants 8111F2 and 9052D1 had the genotype of 6 bpΔmutL , we screened more LT7 mutants to see whether they had wild-type mutL or 6 bpΔmutL by PCR using primers listed in Table 2 , which amplified a 136-bp fragment for wildtype mutL and a 130-bp fragment for 6 bpΔmutL . 
The 6-bp difference could be clearly seen on an agarose gel following electrophoresis ( Fig. 4 ) . 
We especially concentrated on the 8111 derivatives that stopped diversifying their genome structure at a certain stage but also included representatives that continued diversifying their genome structure as controls . 
One interesting branch of the 8111 series contained strains with the first three digits 231 following 8111F , including 8111F23111 and 8111F231211 ( Table 1 ) , which stopped diversifying their ge-nome structure ; these strains had the 136-bp version of the mutL PCR product , in contrast to many other strains of the 8111 series listed in Table 1 , which all had the 130-bp version suggesting a 6-bp deletion . 
We analyzed 10 other strains of 8111F231xx ( x ) , with x representing 1 , 2 , or 3 ( it happened that in our collection of the 8111F231xx or 8111F231xxx strains , there was not a strain producing colonies smaller than 1 mm by diameter ) , and found that all of them had a uniform genome structure as seen in 8111F23111 and 8111F231211 ( Table 1 and Fig. 2 ) as well as the 136-bp version of mutL . 
A similar situation was observed in the 9052 series of the LT7 mutants . 
9052D1 , like 8111F2 , carried 6 bpΔmutL ; many other strains derived from 9052D1 and the strain 9052D2 contained the 130-bp version of the PCR product , indicative of 6 bpΔmutL ( Table 1 ) . 
Strain 9052D132111 , on the other hand , had the 136-bp version of the PCR product , indicative of mutL ( Table 1 ) . 
It was of great interest to note that 9052D132111 stopped producing colonies smaller than 4 mm on further streaking rounds and bacteria from 10 randomly picked colonies of 9052D132111 all contained the 136-bp version of the mutL PCR product .

Frequencies of 6 bpΔmutL in growing populations of mutator and nonmutator strains 
The finding that some mutator strains spontaneously regained the wild-type mutL allele suggests dynamic frequencies of 6 bpΔmutL cells in a population . 
In nonmutator strains , a growing population may contain 6 bpΔmutL cells at a certain `` basal '' frequency . 
Similarly , in mutator strains , a growing population may contain mutL subpopulations of various sizes . 
As bacterial cells with defective mutL alleles may have greater potential for adaptation to changing environments by less strict inhibition of genomic changes such as mutations or recombination [ 22 ] , it would be interesting to know the frequencies of 6 bpΔmutL cells in populations of both mutator and nonmutator strains . 
We randomly picked up 20 colonies of SGSC1417 , which is a nonmutator strain of S. typhimurium LT7 ( Table 1 ) , and found that they all produced the 136-bp PCR fragment with the primers listed in Table 2 ; 20 colonies each of several mutator strains all made the 130-bp PCR fragment with the same primers ( data not shown ) . 
Since the same pair of primers will amplify both 136 - and 130-bp versions of the mutL segment , we would expect to see a weak band on an electrophoresis gel reflecting the nonpredominant subpopulation of cells if the frequencies of the `` minority '' were high enough . 
To estimate at about what ratio a weak band could still be visualized , we combined PCR products of the mutL segment from both wild-type ( 136 bp ) and 6 bpΔmutL ( 130 bp ) cells , with one product at a fixed concentration and the other at 10 series dilutions , and detected the limitation of detection by electrophoresis . 
The highest dilution at which the diluted PCR product could still be visualized on the electrophoresis gel was 1:10 ( Fig. 5 ) , or 1:100 if the samples were very heavily loaded ( data not shown ) . 
We did not see a 130-bp band from a nonmutator strain ( wild-type mutL ) or a 136-bp band from a mutator strain ( 6 bpΔmutL ) at normal loading amounts of the samples ( Fig. 5 ) or higher loadings ( data not shown ) . 
These results suggest that frequencies of bacterial cells carrying 6 bpΔmutL in populations of a nonmutator strain and bacterial cells carrying mutL in populations of a mutator strain should both be lower than 1 % , so screening of much larger samples by higher throughput methods would be necessary to obtain the steady-state frequencies of such minority cells and their dynamics in changing environments .

Discussion
We were prompted to conduct the current study by our recent findings that many archival mutants of S. typhimurium LT7 had a diversifying genome [ 10 ] . 
Interestingly , some but not all of them stopped the genome diversification process at a certain stage . 
We wished to know whether the mutator genotype of S. typhimurium LT7 would be responsible for this unusual phenomenon , as genome diversification might be an important mechanism for bacterial evolution , especially considering the extremely high level of genome structure conservation in enteric bacteria [ 1 ] . 
Based on previous findings by several laboratories over the past 4 decades that S. typhimurium LT7 has defects in the MMR system , we targeted mut genes and identified the deletion of one of three tandem 6-bp repeats in the mutL gene of many S. typhimurium LT7 mutants . 
This study strongly suggests that genome diversification seen in S. typhimurium LT7 mutants is associated with a defect in MMR . 
It is possible that genome diversification requires that the function of MMR be off . 
We had a parallel series of mutants derived from S. typhimurium LT2 that had been stocked under similar conditions for over 40 years . 
The LT2 mutants all had the wild-type mutL allele and no genome diversification was detected in them ( data not shown ) . 
Direct evidence can not be readily obtained to establish the correlation between genome diversification and MMR defects , because inactivation of mutL or other MMR genes would not lead to genome diversification immediately , as accumulation of mutations requires time , and already balanced genomes , like those of LT2 , LT7 , and mutants derived from them , do not need to be rearranged by inversions or translocations ( see details about bacterial genome balancing in [ 23 ] ) . 
Nucleic acid sequence and protein structure analyses of mutL suggest that a deletion in the gene would impair the ATPase activity [ 24 -- 26 ] . 
Such defects may hamper the mismatch repair process in two ways . 
First , MutL mutants defective in ATP-hydrolysis but not ATP-binding ability may activate MutH more efficiently than wild-type MutL does , and the activated MutH may cleave DNA regardless of whether any mismatch exists , thus interfering with normal DNA replication [ 27 ] . 
Second , since MutL interacts physically with MutS [ 28 -- 30 ] , MutH [ 29,31,32 ] , and UvrD [ 33,34 ] and since most of these inter actions require the ATPase activity , MutL lacking ATPase activity may fail to activate MutH or mediate interactions between MutS and MutH , eventually blocking the mismatch repair pathway completely . 
Therefore , the overall consequences of mutL mutations would expectedly be detrimental . 
However , the fact that many archival mutants of LT7 under stress have 6 bpΔmutL would suggest certain benefits for survival that a defective mutL may confer to the bacteria , such as higher tolerance to genomic changes so that beneficial traits may have greater chances to be acquired during bacterial adaptation . 
For example , once under stress , the bacteria would need the following to adapt : ( i ) higher mutation rates for greater chances to modify some less important or redundant genes into those of different functions that might be needed for the bacteria to make use of some originally unusable resources ; ( ii ) easier acceptability to exogenous DNA that may bring in new traits for the bacteria to adapt better to an inhospitable environment ; and ( iii ) more amenability of the genome for rebalancing when necessary [ 35,36 ] . 
We have previously proposed a model , i.e. , the adopt -- adapt model of bacterial genome evolution [ 37,38 ] , hypothesizing the genetic basis of bacterial divergence and speciation , emphasizing acquisition of exogenous DNA ( the `` adopt '' step ) and the ensuing adaptive genomic rearrangements ( the `` adapt '' step ) as key steps , both of which would require the genome to be more tolerant to genome diversification events , such as by disruption of the barrier to recombination in mismatch-repair mutants [ 15 ] . 
Here , one question can not be ignored : how do bacteria take the advantage of obtaining adaptive genomic changes facilitated by the 6 bpΔmutL genotype without accumulating multiple deleterious mutations ? 
The answer may reside in the spontaneous conversion between 6 bpΔmutL and mutL . 
When the mutL function is defective , e.g. , with the genotype of 6 bpΔmutL , exogenous DNA would become more easily incorporated into the genome , e.g. , by phage-mediated transduction , and rearrangements that are necessary to rebalance the genome [ 23 ] would also become possible . 
Although beneficial genomic changes are extremely rare , they do happen . 
If the normal mutL function resumes soon enough by regaining the deleted 6-bp sequence through slipped strand mispairing [ 39 ] or lateral gene transfer [ 40 ] , as seen with some derivatives of mutant strains 8111F2 and 9052D1 in this study , chances of accumulation of deleterious mutations will be reduced . 
We regard this process as spontaneous : under certain circumstances , the 6 bpΔmutL cells may be selected to increase in frequency to cope with stressed conditions . 
This study suggests that S. typhimurium LT7 as a well-known mutator is probably heterogeneous , containing both mutL and 6 bpΔmutL subpopulations , with the former normally predominating ( so the randomly picked colonies of S. typhimurium LT7 strain SGSC1417 all carried wild-type mutL ) and the latter becoming predominant under stressed conditions . 
It is of great significance actually to find , in this study , that some 6 bpΔmutL LT7 cells spontaneously regained the wild-type mutL , and at the same time these bacteria stopped the genome diversification process . 
These findings strongly indicate ( i ) that 6 bpΔmutL cells did predominate in many of the LT7 mutants , because they were so easily picked up , and ( 2 ) that there did exist a tendency for 6 bpΔmutL cells to become mutL cells but not the other way around at equal chances , because we did not find the conversion from mutL cells to 6 bpΔmutL cells during culture of the bacteria in rich medium . 
The implication is that , under stress , 6 bpΔmutL cells , once having obtained certain beneficial traits , are selected to propagate to higher frequencies ( not made de novo ) . 
Once these cells become better adapted after acquiring the new traits , mutL cells would be selected , with 6 bpΔmutL cells being reduced to a basal frequency again . 
The structure of the three tandem 6-bp repeats in the mutL gene dictates its high mispairing rates , facilitating conversion of both 6 bpΔmutL to mutL and mutL to 6 bpΔmutL . 
As a result , 6 bpΔmutL may be transient , long enough for beneficial genomic changes to be made and short enough to avoid the accumulation of deleterious mutations . 
Selection for the mutL + variant when the beneficial mutations have been picked up is possibly a normal process in nature but may not be readily observed in the laboratory , where bacteria grow in a protected environment , without having to compete for food with many diverse organisms in natural settings . 
As a result , this process may become a slow-played version in the laboratory , too slow , so that the mutL − variants might survive for a very long time in the test tubes , to be detected even if they may have accumulated certain deleterious mutations . 
In nature , less fit bacteria such as the mutL − variants with deleterious mutations would be replaced quickly by those that had acquired beneficial traits through mutation or lateral gene transfer ( LGT ) while being mutL − , but regained the wildtype mutL allele soon enough to reduce chances for further mutations or LGT events .

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, culture media, and growth conditions
The bacterial strains used in the study are listed in Table 1 . 
S. typhimurium wild-type strains LT7 and LT2 were from the set of strains isolated by Lilleengen [ 41 ] in the 1940s as representative strains of phage types LT1 through LT22 . 
The mutants of S. typhimurium LT7 and LT2 were originally isolated in the laboratory of M. Demerec in the 1950s and , since the 1960 s , have been stored in the laboratory of A. Eisenstark at room temperature in sealed agar stabs , 0.5 ml per agar stab vial . 
Each agar stab was inoculated with a single colony . 
The content of the vial was homogenized with a sterile spatula and transferred to a glass tube containing 3 ml LB broth . 
A loop of liquid from the tube was streaked onto an LB plate and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 36 h before colony sizes were inspected and recorded . 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoreses (PFGE) methods and genomic mapping
Preparation of intact genomic DNA , endonuclease cleavage of DNA in agarose blocks , and separation of the DNA fragments by PFGE were as described previously [ 42 ] . 
PFGE was performed with the Bio-Rad CHEF Mapper or BioRad CHEF DRII electrophoresis system . 
Sequencing of mut genes
To avoid DNA changes during PCR , we sonicated genomic DNA embedded in agarose and used the fragmented DNA directly as templates for the sequencing . 
Using the primers listed in Table 2 , we determined the sequences o the mutL gene in wild-type as well as mutant strains of S. typhimurium LT7 and LT2 . 
Differentiation between wild-type mutL and 6 bpΔmutL by PCR
We screened colonies to differentiate bacterial cells carrying mutL or the 6 bpΔmutL version of the gene by PCR , with the primers listed in Table 2 . 
PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis with 4 % agarose , at 5 V/cm , for 3.5 h . 
The gel was photographed with the Bio-Rad Gel Doc system ( Bio-Rad ) following electrophoresis .
