via the fecal -- oral route but colonize the gut poorly and invade with bacterial multiplication in the spleen , liver and other organs . 
They re-enter the gut in the later stages of disease but do not colonize the gut in the absence of clinical disease and , therefore , rarely enter the human food chain [ 2,3 ] . 
S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum are serologically identical but differ in their virulence characteristics . 
S. Gallinarum produces fowl typhoid , a severe systemic disease with high mortality in birds of all ages and which , although it has been largely eliminated from those countries which intensiﬁed their industries decades ago and which are able to control the poultry house environment , is still a major problem in those countries which have high ambient temperatures and where environmental control is problematic [ 4 ] . 
S. Pullorum produces pullorum disease characterize remains a major bacterial disease affecting a wide range of hosts and of food-borne signiﬁcance . 
From the point of view of infection biology , the 2463 serovars of S. enterica [ 1 ] fall into two broad classes . 
A small number of serovars produce typhoid-like infection in a restricted number of host species . 
These pathogens include S. Typhi in man , S. Dublin in cattle , S. Choleraesuis in pigs and S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum in poultry . 
These serovars are transmitted Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica ( S. enterica ) by high mortality only in very young birds and followed by persistent disease-free infection in convalescent birds leading to vertical transmission at onset of lay [ 5,6 ] . 
The second class contains the vast majority of the remaining serovars which are capable of infecting a wide range of hosts , including humans . 
The serotypes of this group rarely produce systemic disease in normal healthy , adult animals but colonize the gut without disease and are thus able to enter the human food chain producing foodpoisoning [ 3 ] . 
This group comprises the non-host-adapted serotypes , such as S. Enteritidis , S. Typhimurium , S. Infantis , S. Montevideo and many others . 
Serovars , such as S. Infantis and S. Hadar , which are becoming more prevalent in many European countries , are characterized by good colonization ability and low virulence for chickens [ 7 ] . 
Consumption of contaminated poultry-derived food , including meat and eggs , is considered as the main source of human gastroenteritis [ 8 -- 10 ] . 
S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are anomalous since they belong to both classes in being associated with most cases of human gastroenteritis but also in producing typical typhoid in mice . 
S. Enteritidis has been a major cause of this world-wide zoonosis for the last 2 decades but is under control in many countries which have introduced comprehensive hygienic measures and control policies [ 10,11 ] . 
This has been possible as a result of its relatively high invasiveness which has allowed the development of serological surveillance and the development of live S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium vaccines [ 12 -- 14 ] . 
Another live vaccine , which was produced initially for vaccination against S. Gallinarum , is the semi-rough strain S. Gallinarum 9R , which shows some degree of cross protection against S. Enteritidis infection without spread to the egg contents of the vaccinated ﬂocks [ 15 -- 17 ] . 
The intestinal epithelium is a physical , physiological and immunological barrier against enteric pathogens . 
For many years , the innate immune system was seen as a scavenger system which is responsible for combating the invading pathogens . 
However , it is now clearly evident that innate effector cells mediate a speciﬁc immune response , of controlling and regulating importance , which directs the further adaptive immune response [ 18 ] . 
Indeed , the initial ( innate ) response dictates the nature of the adaptive response which may vary according to serotype [ 19 ] , which has been also seen in poultry [ 20,21 ] . 
This complex interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses is important for clearance of Salmonella . 
However , previous studies have shown that cellular immune responses are much more important for tissue clearance of Salmonella in mice [ 22 ] and also appear to be essential to clearance from the gut in poultry [ 23 ] . 
Changes in cytokine and chemokine gene expression following Salmonella infection have been studied in vitro following infection of epithelial cells and monocytes [ 24 -- 26 ] and in the avian host [ 27 -- 30 ] . 
However , the role of the caecal tonsils in the development of local and systemic immune responses to Salmonella is still not well-characterized . 
This organ is important as it seems likely that it has a major controlling inﬂuence on entry of bacterial and other pathogens into the ceca . 
In mammals , there is evidence that Salmonella can invade the specialized epithelial cells , microfold ( M ) cells , that are present on the epithelial lining of the gut-associated lymphoid tissues ( GALT ) , such as the Peyer 's patches , which sample and transport the luminal antigens into the sub-epithelial lymphoid tissues [ 31 ] . 
In poultry , the molecular basis underlying Salmonella invasion and pathogenesis is unclear . 
However , it is suggested that the systemic Salmonella serovar , S. Gallinarum , also displays such tropism to lymphoid tissues , such as Peyer 's patches and cecal tonsils , and can cross the gut during the early stages of fowl typhoid and enter systemic sites via enterocytes and the intestinal lymphoid tissues [ 32 ] . 
The development of more rational approaches to vaccination will require a better understanding of the pathogen and host immune responses . 
Therefore , in this study we investigated the changes in cellular composition and cytokine and chemokine expression in the cecal tonsil of chickens following infection with Salmonella serovars known to have different biological and pathological characteristics to determine how far the immune response to these pathogens is associated with the differences in the infection biology . 
The gene expression proﬁle of the spleen was also studied in response to Salmonella infection . 
From the above introduction it is clear that S. Gallinarum ( invasive , producing typhoid , non-colonizing ) , S. Pullorum ( invasive , typhoid in very young birds , non-colonizing ) , S. Enteritidis ( invasive but non-typhoidal , colonizing ) and S. Infantis ( poorly invasive , no disease in chickens , colonizing ) represent different virulence characteristics within those Salmonella enteric serovars that infect poultry . 
Representative strains whose biology has been studied previously were therefore to be used .

Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica infection remains a serious problem in a wide range of animals and in man . 
Poultry-derived food is the main source of human infection with the non-host-adapted serovars while fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are important diseases of poultry . 
We have assessed cecal colonization and immune responses of newly hatched and older chickens to Salmonella serotypes Enteritidis , Infantis , Gallinarum and Pullorum . 
S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis colonized the ceca more efﬁciently than S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum . 
Salmonella infection was also associated with increased staining for B-lymphocytes and macrophages in the cecal tonsils of infected birds . 
S. Enteritidis infection in newly hatched birds stimulated the expression of CXCLi1 and CXCLi2 chemokines in the cecal tonsils , while S. Gallinarum up-regulated the expression of LITAF . 
In older chickens , S. Enteritidis infection resulted in a signiﬁcantly higher expression of CXCLi2 , iNOS , LITAF and IL-10 while S. Pullorum appeared to down-regulate CXCLi1 expression in the cecal tonsils . 
Data from spleens showed either no expression or down-regulation of the tested genes .

2. Materials and methods
2.1 . 
Bacterial strains 
Spontaneous nalidixic r acid-resistant ( Nal ) mutants 
of S. Enteritidis P125109 ( www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/ Salmonella ; [ 33 ] ) , S. Infantis 1326.28 [ 7,29 ] , S. Pullorum 449/87 [ 34 ] and S. Gallinarum 287/91 ( www.sanger . 
ac.uk / Projects/Salmonella ; [ 33 ] ) were used in the experimental infections . 
Prior to infection , bacteria were grown in nutrient broth ( Oxoid Ltd , UK ) at ◦ 37 C in an orbital shaking incubator at 150 rpm/min . 
2.2. Experimental chickens
For this study , a total of seventy ﬁve one-day-old Ross 308 commercial broiler chicks were obtained from PD Hook Hatcheries ( Oxfordshire , UK ) . 
Birds were reared in sterilized litter in rooms at a temperature of 30 ◦ C. Birds were given access to antibiotic-free feed and water ad libitum . 
In the 1st experiment , a total of twenty ﬁve one-day-old chicks were divided into ﬁve groups of 5 birds each . 
In the 2nd experiment , a total of ﬁfty one-day-old chicks were divided into ﬁve groups of 10 birds each and kept until they reached three weeks of age . 
To conﬁrm that birds were free from contaminating Salmonella prior to infection , random litter samples were taken from different groups and tested for the presence of Salmonella . 
Samples were incubated in Selenite broth ( Sigma -- Aldrich , UK ) at 37 ◦ C for 24 h and then plated on Brilliant Green agar ( Oxoid Ltd 
UK ) at 37 ◦ C for 24 h before testing suspect colonies with Salmonella-speciﬁc polyclonal antibodies . 
2.3. Vancomycin administration
previously to equalize the levels of colonization between different serovars [ 35 ] . 
Vancomycin ( Sigma -- Aldrich , UK ) is related to avoparcin and was administered one day prior to infection orally with a single 0.5 ml dose of vancomycin solution ( 40 mg/ml ) with subsequent administration in drinking water at the concentration of 100 g/ml . 
All tested Salmonella serotypes used were resistant to vancomycin . 
The glycopepetide antibiotic , avoparcin has been used 
2.4. Experimental design and sampling
tal birds were inoculated orally with different Salmonella serovars while the ﬁfth group of birds were kept as uninfected control . 
lated orally with 0.1 ml of the bacterial culture containing ca. 1 × 108 CFU of the Salmonella serovar . 
The control group was mock-infected with 0.1 ml of an uninoculated nutrient broth . 
One day post-infection , birds were euthanized and cecal contents were taken from all birds for bacteriological examination ( samples were stored at 4 ◦ C for up to 1 h prior to processing ) . 
Cecal tonsils were collected and placed directly in RNA-later ( Sigma -- Aldrich , UK ) at 4 ◦ C for 24 h and then stored at − 80 ◦ C prior to RNA extraction . 
infected orally with different Salmonella serotypes ( one serotype per group ) . 
Each bird was inoculated orally with 0.3 ml of the bacterial culture containing ca. 3 × 108 CFU of the Salmonella serovar . 
The control group was mockinfected with 0.3 ml of an uninoculated nutrient broth . 
At four days post-infection , birds were euthanized and tissue samples were taken post-mortem for further investigations . 
Cecal contents were taken from all birds for bacteriology work and cecal tonsils and spleens were collected for RNA extraction , as described above . 
Caecal tonsils were also taken for histological examination and immunohistochemical staining procedures .

ical procedure . 
Brieﬂy , samples were ﬁxed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24 h , dehydrated and embedded in Cecal tonsils were processed using a standard histologparafﬁn wax and then cut as 6 - m sections . 
Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin using standard procedures and observed by light microscopy . 
2.7. Immunohistochemistry
Frozen sections were prepared from caecal tonsils of Salmonella-infected three-week-old chickens as previously described [ 36 ] and sections were stained using the Vectastain ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories Ltd , UK ) , following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Brieﬂy , cecal tonsils were placed in OCT medium in cryomolds and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then kept at − 80 ◦ C prior to cutting for immunohistchemical staining . 
Sections of 6-m thickness were cut , mounted on polystyrene coated slides and ﬁxed with ice cold acetone . 
After incubating slides with diluted normal serum for 30 min , they were incubated with primary mouse anti-chicken monoclonal antibodies ( Cambridge Bioscience , UK ) against chicken monocytes/macrophages ( KUL01 , 1:200 ) or B-lymphocytes ( AV20 , 1:300 ) for 30 min in room temperature . 
Slides were washed twice with PBS-Tween for 5 min and then incubated with diluted biotinylated secondary antibody solution for 30 min . 
Slides were washed twice , incubated with 0.05 % 3,3 ′ - diaminobinzidine ( DAB ) ( Sigma -- Aldrich , UK ) in 0.01 M PBS ( pH 7.2 ) containing 0.015 % hydrogen peroxide for 1 -- 3 min , dehydrated and counterstained with haematoxylin . 
Two sections were stained per bird and two separate images were taken per section ( Leica Microsystems , UK ) . 
Data were expressed as averages of four measurements in the form of percentages of the brown stained areas ( positive ) to the blue stained areas ( negative ) using Image-Pro Plus software ( Media Cybernetics , UK ) . 
2.8. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using the Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey-Nagel , Fisher Scientiﬁc , UK ) , following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
DNase treatment was conducted to eliminate the contaminating DNA and the puriﬁed RNA was eluted in 60 l of RNase-free water and then kept at − 80 ◦ C until used . 
RNA samples ( 1 g per sample ) were reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit ( Roche Applied Science , UK ) following the manufacturer 's instructions and cDNAs were kept at − 20 ◦ C prior to the performance of the RT-PCR . 
The mRNA gene expression of cytokines and chemokines was determined by qRT-PCR using the Light Cycler 480 System ( Roche Applied Science , UK ) with the following cycle proﬁle : one cycle ◦ at 95 C for 10 min , 45 cycles at 95 ◦ C for 10 ◦ s , 60 C for 30 s and 72 ◦ C for 1 s and one cycle at ◦ 40 C for 30 s. Primers and probes for the house keeping gene ( 28S ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , CXCLi1 , CXCLi2 , IL-6 , IFN - , IL-4 , IL-13 and IL-10 genes have been described previously [ 24,27,37 ] . 
Primers and probes sequences for lipopolysaccaride ( LPS ) - induced tumor necrosis alpha ( TNF - ) factor ( LITAF ) were designed using ensembl database ( http://www.ensembl.org ) and Roche probe design centre ( https://www.roche-applied-science.com ) . 
All primers and probes tested in this stud are shown in Table 1 . 
The Light Cycler ( LC ) 480 Probes Master kit ( Roche Applied Science , UK ) was used for qRT-PCR experiments . 
Each experiment was performed in triplicate and contained three no-template controls , test samples , a calibrator from uninfected control group and a standard Log dilution series . 
In this study , RNA from 10 lipopolysaccharide-stimulated HD11 cells or COS-7 cells was used as standard controls for generation of standard curves and determination of PCR efﬁciencies ( Table 2 ) .

2.9. Data analysis
For qRT-PCR experiments , normalized values were determined using an advanced relative quantiﬁcation method using LC480 analysis software . 
The ratio of expression of each target gene was measured on the basis its relative expression against the level of expression of a 28S reference gene [ 38,39 ] . 
Normalized values were expressed according to the following formula : 
Table 2 
Normalized ratio = ECpT(C)−CpT(S) × ECpR(S)−CpR(C) T R
where CpT/CpR is the cycle number at target/reference detection threshold ( crossing point ) , ET/ER is the efﬁciency of target/reference ampliﬁcation , T is the target , R is the reference , S is the sample , and C is the calibrator . 
Data were analysed using the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using the GraphPad software . 
Comparisons between the infected groups and the non infected control group were performed using the Dunnett 's post-test . 
Multiple comparisons between the infected groups were made using the Tukey 's post-test . 
Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant if P < 0.05

3. Results
3.1. Clinical signs, gross lesions and histopathological changes after Salmonella infection
ca. 1 × 108 CFU of Salmonella did not induce any apparent clinical manifestations or post-mortem lesions at one day post-challenge . 
Further , oral infection of three-week-old chickens with approximately 3 8 S. Pullorum or S. Infantis bird did not also induce any clinical signs of illness over the four days of infection . 
However , S. Gallinarum infected birds showed mild enlargement of the spleen and presence of hemorrhage ( in two birds ) on the mucosal surface of the cecal tonsils at post-mortem examination . 
Nonetheless , no marked microscopic changes were noticed in either the infected or non infected birds on microscopical examination of the cecal tonsils ( data not shown ) . 
Oral infection of newly hatched one-day-old chicks with × 10 CFU of S. Enteritidis , 
3.2. Cecal colonization following Salmonella infection
their ability to colonize the ceca of infected birds ( Table 3 ) . 
All the tested salmonellae were detected in the ceca in relatively high numbers one day after infection of one-day-old chicks . 
However , both of S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis showed a higher capability of cecal colonization , with 9.49 and 9.29 Log10 counts , respectively , in comparison to S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum ( 8.06 and 7.71 Log10 counts , respectively ) ( P < 0.05 ) . 
In older chickens , both S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were also able to colonize the ceca more efﬁciently with 7.3 and 7.6 Log10 counts respectively when compared with S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum which showed signiﬁcantly lower counts despite the use of vancomycin ( 3.71 and 4.30 Log 10 counts , respectively ) ( P < 0.001 ) . 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the ability of either S. Enteritidis or S. Infantis to colonize the ceca and also between S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum ( P > 0.05 ) . 
The tested Salmonella serotypes revealed differences in 
3.3. Immunohistochemical analysis
ing Salmonella infections , the dynamics of B-lymphocytes and macrophages responses were measured in the cecal tonsil tissues using immunohistochemistry ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) . 
After infection , there was a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of B-cells and macrophages in the cecal tonsils To quantify changes in the cellular composition follow-when compared to non infected control birds ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Compared to non infected control birds , S. Pullorum-infected birds showed the highest signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of B-lymphocytes ( P < 0.01 ) followed by S. Infantis , S. Enteritidis and S. Gallinarum ( P < 0.05 ) , with no signiﬁcance between the serotypes . 
The percentage of macrophages in the cecal tonsils of infected birds was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the uninfected controls ( P < 0.01 for S. Enteritidis and S. Gallinarum and P < 0.05 for Salmonella serotypes Infantis and Pullorum ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The percentage of macrophages in the caecal tonsils of S. Enteritidis-infected birds was signiﬁcantly higher than that of S. Pullorum or S. Gallinarum-infected chickens ( P < 0.05 ) . 
3.4. Cytokine and chemokine gene expression of the cecal tonsils of newly hatched chicks in response to Salmonella infection
Salmonella infection of newly hatched day-old chicks differentially modulates the gene expression of selective immune mediators examined in this study . 
There was a signiﬁcant up-regulation in the gene expression levels of CXCLi1 ( < 3.13 fold change , P < 0.05 ) and CXCLi2 ( < 4.79 fold change , P < 0.01 ) chemokines in the cecal tonsils of S. Enteritidis-infected birds when compared to uninfected controls ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Moreover , the expression of CXCLi1 and CXCLi2 chemokines in the cecal tonsils of S. Enteritidis-infected birds was higher than that produced in response to infection with any of the other tested serovars ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Interestingly , S. Gallinarum infection stimulated the expression of higher levels ( < 3.00 fold change ) of LITAF ( P < 0.01 ) . 
No signiﬁcant changes were detected in the expression levels of IL-6 , iNOS , IFN - and IL-4 genes in response to infection with any of Salmonella serotypes tested in this study ( P > 0.05 ) , while IL-10 and IL-13 were not expressed . 
3.5. Cytokine and chemokine gene expression of the cecal tonsils and spleen of older chickens in response to Salmonella infection
The expression of cytokines and chemokines in the cecal tonsils and spleen of Salmonella-infected three-week-old chickens at four days after infection was also determined using qRT-PCR . 
In the cecal tonsils , the presence of mild but signiﬁcant up-regulation in the gene expression of CXCLi2 , iNOS , LITAF and IL-10 was correlated with S. Enteritidis infection when compared to non-infected control

There was a signiﬁcant increase in the expression level of CXCLi2 ( < 2.9 fold change ) , iNOS ( < 3.1 fold change ) , LITAF ( < 1.49 fold change ) and IL-10 ( < 2.25 fold increase ) in S. Enteritidis infected birds . 
In contrast , S. Pullorum down-regulated CXCLi1 mRNA expression ( < 0.5 fold change ) when compared with non infected controls ( P < 0.05 ) ( Figs. 5 and 6 ) . 
Further , the expression of CXCLi2 and LITAF by S. Enteritidis-infected birds was signiﬁcantly higher than that of S. Pullorum - and S. Gallinarum-infected birds ( P < 0.05 ) . 
However , the cytokine and chemokine gene expression was not signiﬁcantly changed in response to S. Infantis or S. Gallinarum infections in comparison with the uninfected controls ( P > 0.05 ) . 
No signiﬁcant changes have been detected in the gene expression levels of IFN - , 
IL-4 , IL-13 from any of the Salmonella infected groups when compared with non-infected birds ( P > 0.05 ) . 
In spleen , CXCLi2 expression was not changed in response to infection with any of the tested serotypes ( P > 0.05 ) , while the expression of iNOS , IL-6 , LITAF , IFN - and IL-4 genes was down-regulated at four days following infection with all Salmonella serotypes in comparison with non infected controls ( P < 0.05 ) ( Fig. 7 ) . 
CXCLi1 , IL-10 and IL-13 were not expressed by the splenic tissue at four days post-infection . 
4. Discussion
An understanding of the immunological mechanisms undertaken by the GALT will provide valuable insights int host and pathogen interaction in the intestine at the cellular level and will help to improve the current scientiﬁc knowledge from the perspective of vaccinology . 
In this study , four different Salmonella serovars , known to produce different pathological conditions in chickens , were compared in terms of their ability to colonize the chicken gut and to elicit immune responses in the cecal tonsils , a major GALT in the avian intestinal tract . 
where the highest bacterial counts are attained . 
Data from the present study has shown that both S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were able to colonize the avian gut to a much higher level than S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum . 
Based on previous ﬁndings [ 35,40,41 ] , administration of the glycopeptides antibiotic , avoparcin , related to vancomycin , to older chickens was used to help with increasing The ceca are the main site of intestinal colonization colonization by those serovars by reducing the inhibitory effects of the gut ﬂora . 
However , this study showed that administration of vancomycin did not to enhance cecal colonization by the systemic serovars S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum clearly indicating that the inability to colonize the gut by these poultry-speciﬁc Salmonella serotypes is not related directly to the inhibitory effects of these gut commensals . 
It has been shown previously that S. Enteritidis infection and/or vaccination of young chicks induce cellular changes in T - and B-cells , macrophages and heterophils , the avian neutrophils , in the cecal mucosa as early as 24 h post-challenge [ 42 -- 44 ] . 
S. Enteritidis infection increases CD4 + T-cells + and IgG B-cells in the cecal tonsils at 4 -- 6 days following infection of 16-day-old chickens [ 45 ] . 
We provide data on the dynamics of inﬁltration of immun cells , macrophages and B lymphocytes in cecal tonsils at four days post-infection of three-week-old chickens with a range of Salmonella serovars . 
Infection with S. Gallinarum led to an increase in macrophages and B-cell populations in the cecal tonsils in response to infection with all typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes tested in this study . 
S. Enteritidis infection increases the positive staining for macrophages while S. Pullorum infection increases the percentages of B-cells in the cecal tonsils of infected three-week-old chickens . 
Previous in vitro studies using epithelial cells indicate that , in contrast to S. Enteritidis S. Gallinarum induces reduced expression of IL-1 [ 24,46 ] . 
In the present study we report an in vivo comparison of cellular and cytokine changes in the cecal tonsils following infection with S. Enteritidis , S. Infantis , S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum . 
Although infection with the systemic serovars revealed lower bacterial counts in the ceca they induced changes in the cytokine and chemokine expression in the gut and in the spleen , including down regulation of iNOS , IL-6 , LITAF , IFN - and IL-4 . 
These ﬁndings indicate that bacterial numbers in the gut are obviously not a major factor in determining the host response to infection . 
The expression of CXCLi1 and CXCLi2 has previously been found to be up-regulated in the chicken gut follow infection of chicks with S. Typhimurium [ 27,47 ] and S. Enteritidis [ 29,37 ] . 
In this study S. Enteritidis infection in day-old chicks and in older chickens was also associated with the expression of CXCLi2 , iNOS and LITAF . 
There was a clear difference with S. Pullorum infection which showed reduced CXCLi1 expression but with an increased B-cell population . 
In contrast , S. Infantis failed to stimulate changes in any of the cytokines tested . 
These ﬁndings are in accordance with previous studies [ 24,46 ] and illustrate that the nature of the innate immune response is dependent on several factors , including the age of infected birds and the infecting Salmonella serotype ( or pathotype ) . 
Most of avian cytokines have been cloned in chickens [ 24 ] while tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) has not been identiﬁed in avian species . 
However , LITAF , which may stimulate the expression of TNFSF15 ( a member of TNF super-family ) , has been identiﬁed [ 48 ] . 
An increase in the gene expression level of LITAF was correlated with an increase in macrophage counts in the cecal tonsils four days after infection of older chickens . 
The data from the present experiment has shown up-regulation of LITAF in the cecal tonsils as early as 24 h following infection of newly hatched chicks with S. Gallinarum , again pointing out the importance of this lymphoid tissue in the pathogenesis and immune response surrounding Salmonella-associated infections in poultry . 
This is the ﬁrst description of LITAF expression in the cecal tonsils of Salmonella-infected birds . 
In mice , TNF - is induced by murine macrophages in response to LPS treatment or Salmonella infection and has been shown to play a central role in clearance of and controlling Salmonella infection in mammals [ 49 -- 53 ] . 
Although little is known about the biological function of LITAF in poultry , it has been reported that the expression of this co-stimulatory molecule was upregulated in S. Typhimurium LPS-stimulated macrophages and in response to treatment with Eimeria species [ 48 ] . 
It is also suggested that LITAF plays an important role in driving inﬂammatory responses and bacterial clearance , though its role in avian salmonellosis remains unclear and requires further investigations . 
Nonetheless , the expression of higher levels of LITAF in the ceca of newly hatched chicks has been reported in response to infection with S. Enteritidis [ 29 ] , suggesting a role in the inﬂammatory responses and clearance of Salmonella . 
Recent evidence has shown that TNF - possesses a regulating function and controlling the expression of Salmonella effector proteins , including SipA and SpvB [ 54 ] . 
We suggest that the role of TNF - could extend to include , and regulate , the expression of Salmonella effector protein , AvrA . 
AvrA inhibits the host inﬂammatory response against infection , via acting on MAPK , Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and NF - B signaling pathways [ 55 ] . 
AvrA blocks I B degradation and ubiquitination which interferes with the nuclear translocation of active NF - B , leads to inhibition of NF - B signaling and inhibition of induction of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines , including IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , IFN - and TNF - [ 56 -- 58 ] . 
In the present study , the differential expression of cytokine and chemokine response between systemic and enteric serovars , as exempliﬁed by S. Pullorum and S. Enteritidis , may be inﬂuenced by translocation of bacterial AvrA

Asterisks indicate signiﬁcance from uninfected control birds ( * P < 0.05 ) . 
Although the role of AvrA in either S. Pullorum or S. Gallinarum infection in poultry has not yet been identiﬁed , this effector protein appears to play an important role in avian systemic salmonellosis , mediating the down-regulation of inﬂammatory cytokines , including IL-18 ( IFN - promoter ) . 
The production of iNOS has been correlated with the host resistance of mice against S. Typhimurium infection [ 59 ] and with the cecal responses to infection with S. Typhimurium , S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar in newly hatched chicks [ 29 ] . 
In the current experiment , the expression of iNOS by the cecal tonsils in response to S. Enteritidis infection indicates the central role of macrophages in clearance of this pathogen . 
In order to further investigate the avian immune responses following Salmonella infections , the expression of several genes involved in acquired immunity was also measured . 
Although no signiﬁcant changes were detected in the gene expression levels of T-cell mediated cytokines IFN - , IL-4 and IL-13 in the cecal tonsils following Salmonella infection , the mRNA gene expression level of IL-10 was up-regulated in the cecal tonsils of S. Enteritidis-infected birds . 
The expression of IL-10 by murine macrophages has been reported in response to S. Typhimurium infection [ 60 ] and S. Enteritidis infection of chicken oviduct epithelial cells ( COEC ) [ 26 ] . 
This observation differs from previous ﬁndings by Fasina et al. [ 47 ] who reported down-regulation of IL-10 in the gut of S. Typhimurium-orally-infected chickens . 
It is believed that IL-10 is an anti-inﬂammatory mediator and produced to down-regulate the effects of IFN - and to prevent overexpression of host defenses against infection [ 25 ] . 
In the present study , however , the level of IFN - expression measured at four days after infection did not differ signiﬁcantly between the infected and non-infected birds . 
sion of IL-13 ( a Th2 cytokine ) in chickens in response to Salmonella infection . 
However , previous work has shown that IL-13 is expressed in the liver of turkeys following the exposure to the protozoan Histomonas meleagridis , the causative agent of blackhead disease [ 61 ] . 
The absence of statistically signiﬁcant changes in the gene expression of IFN - , IL-4 and IL-13 could be a result of the early sampling time conducted in this experiment ( four days post-infection ) . 
In this study our data from spleen revealed down regulation in the gene expression of most of tested cytokines , including IL-4 . 
These results are in the line with previous reports in response to S. Typhimurium infection [ 27,28 ] . 
Our ﬁndings from the splenic tissue can be interpreted in the light of the observations by Beal et al. [ 62 ] , following S. Typhimurium infection when proliferation of T-lymphocytes was diminished while recruiting T cells from the spleen to the intestine . 
This paradoxical Until now , no data has been available on the expres-phenomenon in Salmonella immunity has been also observed after Salmonella infection in mice [ 63 ] . 
While no signiﬁcant changes were seen in IL-4 gene expression in the caecal tonsils following S. Pullorum infection four days after infection , data from immunohistochemical staining revealed an increase in the amount of B-lymphocyte-positive staining in the cecal tonsils of S. Pullorum-infected birds over non infected controls . 
The latter has been observed with down regulation in CXCLi1 gene expression following infection . 
These ﬁndings could indicate the potential role of humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of S. Pullorum infection and the development of the carrier state , a possible Th2-driven pathway indicated in our previous studies [ 46 ] . 
The data presented here shows that the innate immune system of poultry can respond to different classes of Salmonella to produce a serotype-speciﬁc cytokine response and cellular changes after infection . 
S. Enteritidis is a strongly inﬂammatory serotype inducing the production of iNOS and CXCLi1 and CXCLi2 chemokines when compared to the other serotypes tested in this study . 
Whilst S. Infantis showed a high level of cecal colonization it did not stimulate the production of a signiﬁcant changes in the level of CXCLi2 and iNOS compared to S. Enteritidis indicating that the bacterial load in the ceca is not directly related to the induction o cytokines . 
The data presented also shows that S. Pullorum , unlike S. Enteritidis , is a less-inﬂammatory and , therefore , chickens infected with this systemic serotype are unlikely to mount a strong inﬂammatory response in the intestine . 
S. Gallinarum infection stimulates limited inﬂammatory responses although the data shows that LITAF is up-regulated in the cecal tonsils during the early stages of infection with this systemic serovar . 
Further work is required to clarify the role of this TNF - like molecule in the course of Salmonella infection .
