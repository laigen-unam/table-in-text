Abstract 
Salmonella typhimurium purR encodes a transcriptional repressor regulating gene expression of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis . 
It represses purD gene transcription by binding to the 16-base pair purD operator ( PUR box ) . 
A S. typhimurium strain carrying a super-repressing mutant of purR , purRs , has been used as an experimental system to study adaptive mutation . 
Escherichia coli lac genes were genetically engineered into S. typhimurium chromosome and repressed by purRs so that they could be used as an indicator of adaptive mutations in purRs or in the purD operator . 
Mutations in purRs or in the purD operator accumulated when the mutant strain was placed on a minimal lactose plate supplemented with 10 g/ml of adenine during prolonged incubation . 
These speciﬁc mutations reverted the mutant strain from lac − to lac + phenotype . 
The lac + strains were categorized into the early - and late-arising mutants according to the time for colony appearance . 
Our genetic studies indicate that ( i ) Poisson distributed mutations accumulated in the chromosomal regulatory gene purR or the purD operator in very slowly dividing cells under selection ; ( ii ) after about 8 days of selection , the frequency of mutations in purD operator reached the high value of about two mutations per 108 cells ; ( iii ) the mutational spectrum in the purD operator during growth was not signiﬁcantly different from that during selection ; ( iv ) defects in mutL or mutS appeared to have a stronger effect on growth-dependent mutations than on adaptive mutations .

1. Introduction
Adaptive mutations are spontaneous mutations that occur in microorganisms during periods of prolonged stress in non-dividing or very slowly dividing population . 
The most popular system for studying adaptive mutation is Escherichia coli FC 40 [ 2 ] , Which carries a lac − allele on an F ′ episome but readily reverts to lactose utilization when lactose is its sole carbon source . 
Up to now , similar observations have been reported in both bacteria and yeast [ 1 -- 6 ] . 
These systems were usually observed when the populations were subject to non-lethal selection for reversions of known mutations in genes responsible for carbon source catabolism or for amino acids biosynthesis . 
Here , we reported a novel system for studying adaptive mutations in the chromosomal regulatory gene purR and the purD operator . 
We have constructed a strain of Salmonella typhimurium , 5-28 , in which the lac operon has been inserted in the purD gene so that it becomes repressed by the super-repressing S mutant of purR ( purR ) . 
Under lactose selective condition , this strain acquires spontaneous mutations in purR and the purD operator , permitting it to utilize lactose ( Lac + ) . 
We ﬁrst characterized the mutations that occurred under selective condition , and then we compared the mutational spectra in the purD operator between the early-arising and late-arising mutants . 
Finally , we studied the effect of mismatch repair defectives on the accumulation of Lac + colonies .

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strains and phages
All strains and phages used are listed in Table 1 . 
Strain 5-28 , a derivative of strain TT12306 , was isolated using standard DES mutagenesis method [ 7 ] . 
All the derivatives of 5-28 were constructed by conventional P22 transduction [ 7 ] . 
The mismatch-repair-defective derivatives of 5-28-2 carry mutL111 : : Tn10 or mutS121 : : Tn10 . 
The mutL or mutS phenotype was veriﬁed by high spontaneous reversion to RifR . 
Phage H5 was used to check strains for sensitivity to phage P22 . 
2.2. Media
We used LB medium ( 1 % peptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , 0.5 % NaCl ) as the complete medium . 
Glycerol minimal medium contains NCE salts [ 8 ] supplemented with 0.2 % glycerol , 10 g/ml adenine and 0.06 mM VB1 . 
Lactose minimal agar contains NCE salts supplemented with 1 % lactose , 10 g/ml adenine and 0.06 mM VB1 . 
EMB medium [ 8 ] is supplemented with 1 % lactose , 0.06 mM VB1 and 100 g/ml adenine . 
An amount of 100 g/ml adenine was used to repress the purine nucleotide synthesis . 
Antibiotic concentrations in complete medium are : 50 g/ml Kanamycin , 20 g/ml tetracycline , and 50 g/ml ampicillin . 
All cultures were incubated at 30 ◦ C . 
A 0.85 % NaCl ( saline ) was used to dilute cultures except as noted . 
2.3. Accumulation of Lac+ mutants
Five milliliter overnight cultures of strain 5-28 were grown to saturation in NCE-glycerol medium . 
Then , cells were harvested , washed twice and resuspended in 5 ml saline . 
Aliquots of 0.1 ml resuspension containing 3 × 108 cells were spread on 30 minimal lactose plates and incubated at 30 ◦ C. Lac + colonies were counted each day for 8 days of incubation . 
On each day , the number of viable 5-28 cells ( Lac − ) on minimal lactose plates was determined by taking agar plugs ( avoiding Lac + colonies ) from one of a set of ﬁve plates . 
Bacteria on 25 mm2 agar plugs were vortexed with 1 ml saline . 
Dilutions were spread on LB plates containing kanamycin and assayed for 5-28 viability . 
2.4. Reconstruction experiments
Reconstruction experiments were performed as described by Steel and Jinks-Robertson [ 6 ] .

HT105/1 int-201 P22c2 
The distribution of Lac + mutants among different cultures of 5-28 was measured using the Fluctuation tests of Lüria and Delbrück [ 9 ] . 
A culture of 5-28 was diluted 105-fold in fresh medium . 
Approximately , 103 cells from this dilution were dispensed to each of 50 tubes containing 2 ml NCE-glycerol minimal medium and incubated to saturation at 30 ◦ C. Each culture was harvested , washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml saline . 
Aliquots of 0.1 ml containing 3 × 108 of 5-28 cells were plated on minimal lactose plates . 
The number of Lac + colonies was counted everyday . 
Mutation rates were calculated using the P0 method [ 9 ] or the method of median [ 10,11 ] . 
2.6. Transductional crosses
Transductional crosses , mediated by the phage mutant P22 HT105/1 int-201 , were carried out according to conventional P22 transduction [ 7 ] . 
2.7. DNA sequence analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from each mutant . 
A 211 bp region harboring the purD operator was ′ PCR ampliﬁed with primer 5 - AGAAAGCTTCGC-GAGCGTTGC-3 ′ ( forward ) and 5 ′ - CCAATTGTCC - ′ AGCAGCTC-3 ( reverse ) . 
The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method . 
2.8. Experiments with mismatch-repair- defective strains
The protocol is similar to that used by Foster and Cairns [ 12 ] . 
Five to eight independent cultures of 5-28-2 mutL ( or 5-28-2 mutS ) were grown to saturation in LB medium and stored at 4 ◦ C for 2 days while the frequency of Lac + mutants in each was determined . 
The culture with the lowest number of Lac + mutants was used to inoculate 40 2-ml LB medium from a starting inoculum of 106 cells per ml . 
At saturation , these cultures reached a density of 3 × 109 cells per ml . 
For controls , 40 × 2-ml cultures 6 of 5-28-2 were also inoculated with 10 cells per ml × and yielded 3 109 cells per ml at saturation . 
About 108 cells of 5-28-2 or 107 cells of 5-28-2 mutL ( or 
5-28-2 mutS ) were plated with 109 scavenger cells ( LT2 ) on minimal lactose plates . 
The Lac + colonies were counted after 2 days of incubation .

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Experimental system
The lacZYA genes , as a part of MudJ element , are inserted in the purD gene , therefore lacZYA are subject to purR regulation . 
MudJ is a Mu-derived element with Mu ends ﬂanking the wild-type lacZYA and a kanamycin resistance gene [ 13 ] . 
Since MudJ lacks all Mu genes including the A and B transposase genes , it has no transposition activity . 
Strain 5-28 carries a super-repressing mutant of purR , purRs . 
Because expression of lac genes is strongly repressed by the purRs super-repressor , purRS mutant strain can not utilize lactose . 
We ﬁnd , however , that it readily reverts to Lac + when lactose is the sole carbon source . 
Under these conditions , the purRs gene or the PUR box undergoes spontaneous mutations that relieve the repression by purRs and allows cells to grow on the lactose medium . 
Therefore , the genetically engineered lac genes can be used to study adaptive mutation of purR gene and the purD operator under lactose selective condition . 
Schematic structure of this system is shown in Fig. 1 .

The purD locus was interrupted by an insertion of the Mu-derived element , MudJ , which includes wild-type lac genes and a kanamycin determinant . 
Salmonellae are naturally Lac − . 
The lac genes are derived from E. coli K12 . 
The operator of purD has a 16 bp PUR box bound by the purR repressor 
Overnight cultures of the strain 5-28 were grown to saturation in NCE-glycerol medium . 
Then cells were harvested , washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml saline . 
Aliquots of 0.1 ml resuspension containing 108 cells were spread on minimal lactose plates and incubated at 30 ◦ C. Surprisingly , an average of less than ﬁve lac + colonies , referred to early-arising mutants , appeared in 2 -- 3 days after plating . 
Thereafter a certain number of lac + colonies , referred to late-arising mutants , continued to appear until the whole plate was covered with colonies . 
( Fig. 2 ) . 
Appearance of the late-arising mutants has been observed in other experimental systems [ 1 -- 6 ] . 
Our statistical analysis of the data in Fig. 3 showed a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.03 between the number of the early-arising mutants and the number of the late-arising mutants . 
This result excluded the possibility of cross feeding of the late arising mutants by the early-arising lac + colonies [ 6 ] . 
One interpretation for appearance of the late-arising Lac + mutants is that these mutants are slow-growing mutants . 
Approximately 100 mutants that made their appearance at deﬁned times ( days 4 , 5 , 6 , etc. ) were picked , respectively , and streaked for single colonies on minimal lactose plates . 
All the mutants formed visible colonies within 2 -- 3 days after streaking . 
Therefore the late-arising colonies were not likely to be slow-growing mutants . 
Further conﬁrmation was obtained by carrying out reconstruction experiments . 
One hundred cells of each mutant were spread on minimal lactose plates in the presence of 108 cells of the original strain 5-28 . 
In all cases , approximately 100 Lac + colonies appeared within 2 -- 3 days after plating , regardless of the time required by each individual mutant to appear in the initial reversion assays . 
Thus , the speculation that late-arising mutants have a slow growth rate is invalid . 
The appearance of the late-arising mutants could be explained if the auxotrophic cells were still multiplying under selective condition . 
Growth of strain 5-28 ( Lac − ) on lactose plates was measured by punching out small plugs from between Lac + colonies and assayed for viability on nutrient agar plates containing kanamycin . 
The population of the strain 5-28 ( Lac − ) underwent less than one doubling in the ﬁrst 8 days , while the number of `` Lac + '' mutants increased from zero to more than 150 per plate ( shown in Fig. 3 ) . 
The amount of DNA synthesis in slowing-growing 528 cells is orders of magnitude too low to account for the observed late-rising mutants [ 14 ] . 
This suggested that the mutants arose after plating as a result of processes that were time-dependent but not growth-dependent . 
We also determined the role of lactose in the production of late-arising Lac + mutants according to the method described by Foster 1992 [ 12 ] . 
Aliquots of 0.1 ml containing 3 × 108 5-28 cells ( lac − ) were plated on NCE plates without lactose . 
No Lac + mutants arose until the plates were overlaid with agar containing lactose ( data not shown ) , indicating that the appearance of late-arising mutants was a speciﬁc response to lactose selection .

3.3. The late reversion occurs on selective medium
We have examined the distribution of numbers of early and late-arising mutant colonies in 50 independent cultures plated on selective plates . 
Fig. 4 shows that the early-arising colonies formed a distribution close to the Lea and Coulson distribution as expected for mutations arising during exponential growth . 
Whereas the late-arising colonies are Poisson distributed , as expected for mutations arising after plating . 
3.4. Mutations are occurring in purRs and the purD operator
3.4.1 . 
Detection of mutations in purR gene Strain TGM463 ( purR + ) carries one copy of mini-Tn10 insert near purR ( Tet is 90 % linked to purR + ) . 
The TGM463 strain forms white colonies on an EMB plate supplemented with 100 g/ml adenine , referred as repressive EMB plate . 
A P22 lysate grown on TGM463 was used as a donor to transduce each of the independent early and late-rising mutants . 
Then TetR transductants were selected on repressive EMB tetracycline plates . 
If a mutation occurs in purRs and reverts to purR − , about 90 % TetR transductants will form white colonies on repressive EMB tetracycline plates , as the purR + phenotype is 90 % linked to the tetracycline resistance . 
In contrast , if no reversion occurs in purRs gene , all the TetR transductants will emerge as red colonies , as purR and purD are located at 31 ′ and 89 ′ of the genetic map of S. typhimurium , respectively . 
3.4.2 . 
Detection of mutations in the purD operator In order to analyze the mutations not located in purR gene , the P22 lysate grown on each of the early and late-rising mutants , which gave rise to all red TetR transductants in the ﬁrst step , was used to transduce the wild-type strain LT2 . 
KanR transductants were selected on repressive EMB kanamycin plates . 
The mutants carry a MudJ ( lac , KanR ) element inserted in the coding region of purD gene . 
The purD operator and lacZ gene are 98 and 100 % linked to the kanamycin resistance , respectively . 
Mutations in the purD operator can be identiﬁed by measuring the ratio of red colonies to white colonies among the KanR transductant on repressive EMB kanamycin plates . 
If mutations occur in the PUR box , 98 % KanR transductants will form red colonies . 
If mutations occur in lacZ , 100 % KanR transductants will form red colonies . 
A total of 150 independent early-arising and 401 late-arising mutants from two independent experiments were analyzed by transductional crosses as shown above . 
The Lac + mutants carried mutations in purRs or in the purD operator ( see Table 2 ) . 
No lacZ mutations were detected throughout the whole experiment . 
Table 2 shows that the early and late-arising mutants grown on lactose minimal medium had mutations in either purR gene or the PUR box of purD gene . 
Percentage of mutations occurred in purR gene was higher in the late-arising mutants than in the early-arising mutants , whereas percentage of mutations occurred in the purD operator was much lower in the late-arising mutants than in the early-arising mutants . 
The percentage of mutants in purR gene was signiﬁcant higher in the late-arising mutations , suggesting that the growth-dependent and adaptive mutations may be generated by different processes . 
3.5. Comparison of mutational spectra in the purD operator
Forty-ﬁve early-arising and 41 late-arising mutants with mutations in the purD operator were analyzed by DNA sequencing , and the mutational spectra in the purD operator are presented in Fig. 5 . 
The spectra show that the early and late arising mutants all had mutations at ﬁve sites : G3 , A5 , C6 , G9 , C14 . 
The pur gene operator ( PUR box ) is a 16 bp consensus sequence [ 16,17 ] and highly conserved at eight nucleotides , which are essential for recruiting purR repressor . 
Our sequence analysis of the purD operator showed that mutations were located at ﬁve crucia conserved bases . 
These mutations caused the loss of function of the purD operator and disrupted its interaction with the repressor purR . 
The mutational spectrum of the early-arising ( growth-dependent ) mutants shows that the vast majority of mutation events were base substitution ( 43/45 ) . 
In addition , one deletion and one duplication were also detected . 
The spectrum of the late-arising ( adaptive ) mutants is similar to the growth-dependent mutational spectrum except that no deletions and duplications were detected . 
All the events were base substitutions ( 41/41 ) occurred mainly at A5 and C14 ( 26/41 ) . 
We used the algorithm developed by Adam and Skopek [ 18 ] to compare the growth-dependent mutation spectrum with the adaptive mutation spectrum . 
The results showed that the difference between the two spectra was statistically insigniﬁcant ( P = 0.18 ) . 
Fig. 4 . 
( A and B ) Distributions of lac + mutants from 50 independent cultures of strain 5-28 . 
The theoretical and experimental distributions of Lac + mutants were obtained by plotting log ( x ) vs. log ( proportion of cultures with x or more mutants ) , where `` x '' is the number of mutants per culture [ 1 ] . 
The rate of mutation in purD , under conditions of selection , was surprisingly high . 
We calculated it from the data in Fig. 4 , Table 2 and the spectrum of mutations shown in Fig. 5 . 
By day 8 , the frequency of Lac + mutants was about 3 × 10 − 7 . 
Among them , about 6 % ( 1.8 × 10 − 8 ) had mutations in one of the ﬁve conserved base pairs in purD . 
This gave a rate per base pair of about 3 × 10 − 9 , or an average of 0.01 changes per chromosome . 
In contrast to the frequency of mutations in purR ( 2.8 × 10 − 7 ) , the frequency in 16-bp purD operator was much higher than expected . 
It is not clear how it happened . 
One simple explanation is that it may be more effective for cells to alter the sequences of the 16-bp purD operator than to alter the 1.4 kb purR , which encodes a complex repressor regulating multiple metabolism pathways [ 16 ] . 
The biological signiﬁcance behind this phenomenon awaits further studies .

3.6 . 
Effect of mismatch-repair-defectives on adaptive mutation 
MutLSHU mismatch repair system plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability . 
It was hypothesized that adaptive mutations occur due to a decline in mismatch repair [ 19 ] . 
In FC 40 , MMR defects had as large an effect on adaptive mutations as they did on the growth-dependent mutations [ 12,20 ] . 
We ﬁrst observed , the effect of defects in mutL or mutS on adaptive mutations of 5-28-2 . 
Defects in mutL or mutS increased adaptive mutation rates by about 10-fold and growth-dependent mutation rates by about a 40 -- 100-fold ( Table 3 ) . 
This suggests that MMR may be functioning less efﬁciently in stationary and slowly-dividing cells than in growing cells .
