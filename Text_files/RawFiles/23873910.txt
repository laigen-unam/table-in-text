Motility of bacteria like Salmonella enterica is a highly regulated process that responds to a variety of internal and external stimuli . 
A hierarchy of three promoter classes characterizes the Salmonella ﬂagellar system , and the onset of ﬂagellar gene expression depends on the oligomeric regulatory complex and class 1 gene product FlhD4C2 . 
The ﬂhDC promoter is a target for a broad range of transcriptional regulators that bind within the ﬂhDC promoter region and either negatively or positively regulate ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
In this work , we demonstrate that the RﬂM protein is a key component of ﬂhDC regulation . 
Transposon mutagenesis was performed to investigate a previously described autoinhibitory effect of the ﬂagellar master regulatory complex FlhD4C2 . 
RﬂM is a LuxR homolog that functions as a ﬂagellar class 1 transcriptional repressor . 
RﬂM was found to be the negative regulator of ﬂhDC expression that is responsible for the formerly described autoinhibitory effect of the FlhD4C2 complex on ﬂhDC operon transcription ( K. Kutsukake , Mol . 
Gen. Genet . 
254:440 -- 448 , 1997 ) . 
We conclude that upon commencement of ﬂagellar gene expression , the FlhD4C2 complex initiates a regulatory feedback loop by activating rﬂM gene expression . 
rﬂM encodes a transcriptional repressor , RﬂM , which ﬁne-tunes ﬂhDC expression levels . 
The biosynthesis , assembly , and rotation of ﬂagella require a significant amount of biosynthetic resources and energy ( 1 , 2 ) . 
The expression of ﬂagellar genes is regulated in response to various environmental conditions , which can determine the onset of ﬂagellar bio-synthesis and the overall degree of ﬂagellation ( 3 , 4 ) . 
One difference between ﬂagellar gene expression in Escherichia coli and Salmonella is that under low-nutrient conditions , the ﬂagellar regulon can be either induced ( E. coli ) or repressed ( Salmonella ) ( 5 -- 8 ) . 
In all systems examined to date , ﬂagellar synthesis is repressed during bioﬁlm formation and upon entry into host cells ( 9 -- 12 ) . 
The more than 60 genes of the ﬂagellar regulon are organized into a transcriptional hierarchy of three promoter classes . 
The ﬂagellar master operon , ﬂhDC ( under the control of the ﬂa-gellar class 1 promoter ) , is transcribed to produce the FlhD4C2 transcriptional activator complex that is needed for the activation of genes downstream in the ﬂagellar transcriptional hierarchy , which are transcribed from ﬂagellar class 2 promoters . 
FlhD4C2-dependent genes are required for the structure and assembly of the ﬂagellar hook-basal body ( HBB ) , which functions as the motor of the ﬂagellum . 
Also transcribed from a class 2 ﬂagellar promoter is the ﬂiA gene , which encodes the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc transcription factor 28 , required to transcribe ﬂagellar class 3 promoters . 
Class 3 ﬂagellar genes encode proteins required after HBB completion , including ﬁlament ( ﬂiC and ﬂjB ) , motor force generators ( motAB ) , and components of the chemosensory system ( che ) . 
A broad range of factors positively and negatively regulate expression of the ﬂhDC operon . 
Transcription of ﬂhDC from the class 1 promoter is dependent on the binding of the cyclic AMP-catabolite gene activator protein complex and can also be activated by the iron-regulatory protein Fur and by the nucle-oid proteins Fis and H-NS ( 13 -- 17 ) . 
Those regulatory factors bind directly to the ﬂhDC promoter region , as shown for Fis in Salmonella and for Fur and H-NS in E. coli ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) . 
There are numerous negative regulators of ﬂagellar biosynthesis , including SlyA , a transcriptional regulator of ﬂhDC ( 19 ) that is also required for Salmonella virulence ( 20 ) , RtsB , a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) - encoded repressor of ﬂagellar class 1 transcription ( 21 ) , LrhA ( 22 ) , and RcsB . 
RcsB is reported to positively regulate SPI-2 expression and favor Salmo-nella growth in macrophages ( 23 ) . 
RcsB also binds an RcsB box in the ﬂhDC promoter region to repress the ﬂagellar master operon ( 23 , 24 ) . 
Finally , ﬂhDC transcription is reported to be under autogenous control ( 13 ) . 
FlhD4C2 is also under posttranscriptional regulation . 
The ﬂagellar protein FliZ is a product of the ﬂiAZ operon , which is transcribed from ﬂagellar class 2 and 3 promoters . 
FliZ positively regulates additional ﬂagellar class 2 gene expression ( 25 ) . 
According to Saini et al. , FliZ posttranslationally alters the concentration of FlhD4C2 ( 26 ) . 
Data provided by Wada et al. suggest that FliZ has a repressing effect on YdiV , another posttranscriptional anti-FlhD4C2 factor ( 27 ) . 
YdiV binds to FlhD and prevents the FlhD4C2 complex from binding to class 2 promoters , either by physically keeping the FlhDC complex away from free promoter DNA or by releasing FlhDC from the DNA-bound state ( 7 , 28 ) . 
In an earlier study , we identiﬁed RﬂM , previously known as EcnR ( see Materials and Methods ) , as a repressor of ﬂhDC transcription . 
RﬂM is encoded in close proximity to the antidote/toxin gene pair ecnAB and exhibits the typical characteristics of an OmpR-like response regulator ( 29 ) . 
It was therefore originally named EcnR ( entericidin gene R ) , but experimental analyses showed ecnAB to be posS itively regulated by and negatively regulated by EnvZ/OmpR ( 29 ) . 
There is no evidence for regulation of ecnAB by RﬂM ( EcnR ) . 
In our previous work , we isolated ﬂhDC promoter mutants that suppressed RﬂM inhibition ( 30 ) . 
The inhibitory effect of RﬂM on motility has been shown to be dependent on the RcsCDB system ( 30 ) . 
An additional deletion of rcsDBC or an insertion in rcsB prevented the reported loss of motility of P rﬂM . 
Here , we characterized the inhib-ara itory effect of RﬂM on ﬂhDC transcription . 
FlhD4C2 activates transcription of rﬂM , and in turn , RﬂM represses ﬂhDC transcription . 
The RﬂM-FlhD C feedback loop thereby accounts for the for-4 2 merly described autoregulatory effect of FlhD C on ﬂhDC operon 4 2 transcription .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and media . 
All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Cells were cultured in lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium , supplemented with tetracycline ( 15 g ml 1 ) or anhydrotetra-1 cycline ( AnTc ) ( 1 g ml ) if needed . 
Gene expression from the arabinose promoter was achieved by addition of 0.2 % - arabinose to the medium . 
L The generalized transducing phage of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-murium P22 HT105/1 int-201 was used in all crosses ( 31 ) . 
Experiments using the virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s background were performed under SPI-1-inducing conditions ( 24 , 32 , 33 ) . 
Cultures were grown under high-osmolarity ( 1 % NaCl , ﬁnal ) and low-oxygen ( without agitation ) conditions and if necessary supplemented with anhydrotetracycline and arabinose as described above . 
Phenotypic Lac activity was observed using MacConkey lactose ( MacLac ) agar supplemented with 0.2 % arabinose if required . 
Nomenclature . 
The gene rﬂM was originally named ecnR since it was a putative regulatory protein linked to the toxin-antitoxin genes ecnAB ( 29 ) . 
The change in nomenclature thereby displays the newly characterized function of RﬂM as a modulator of the ﬂagellar master operon ﬂhDC ( regulator of ﬂagellar master operon ) . 
Isolation of random T-POP insertions . 
Strain TH15941 [ araBAD1007 : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC5213 : : MudJ ﬂiA5886 ( R91C L207P ) ] carries the ﬂhD C operon expressed from the chromosomal araBAD promoter ( ParaBAD ) ( 19 ) . 
It also carries a lac operon ( via insertion of the MudJ transposon into the ﬂhC gene ) transcriptional reporter fusion to the chromosomal ﬂhDC promoter ( ﬂhC5213 : : MudJ ) and a ﬂiA null allele that is defective in binding DNA ( 34 ) . 
The introduction of the ﬂiA null allele was 28 to prevent any potential effects of activity on the ﬂhDC autoregulatory control . 
Strain TH15941 is Lac but becomes Lac in the presence of arabinose ( Ara-Lac ) due to induction of ﬂhD C transcription from ParaBAD , resulting in autorepression of ﬂhC-lac reporter transcription by FlhD4C2 . 
P22 phage prepared from T-POP donor strain TH3923 { pJS28 ( Apr P22-9 ) F = 114 ( Ts ) Lac zzf-20 : : Tn10 [ tetA : : MudP ] ( Tcs ) zzf-3823 : : Tn10dTc [ del-25 ] leuA414 hsdSB Fels2 } was used to introduce T-POP into strain TH15941 carrying plasmid pNK2881 , which constitutively expresses the Tn10 transposase gene carrying the ats-1 and ats-2 ( altered target speciﬁcity mutations ) alleles , which result in the random insertion of Tn10 derivatives into the chromosome ( 35 ) . 
About 30,000 T-POP insertions in TH15941 were screened for loss of FlhD4C2 autorepression , an Ara-Lac phenotype , in the presence of tetracycline ( Tc-Ara-Lac ) . 
Thirty T-POP insertions that had an initial Ara-Lac phenotype in the presence of Tc were isolated and were further characterized as described in Results . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
- Galactosidase activity was measured according to method of Zhang and Bremer ( 36 ) with minor modiﬁcations as described in the following . 
For each strain , a minimum of three independent biological replicates were picked from individual colonies . 
For experiments performed with LT2 , cells were grown overnight in general LB medium . 
Strain 14028s was grown under SPI-1 inducing conditions in LB medium supplemented with 1 % NaCl ( ﬁnal ) and without shaking . 
LT2 samples were diluted 1:100 in LB medium supplemented with 0.2 % L-ar-abinose and 1 g ml 1 anhydrotetracycline if needed . 
Cultures were grown until mid-log phase at 37 °C before permeabilization of the cells using 100 mM Na2HPO4 , 20 mM KCl , 2 mM MgSO4 , 0.08 % CTAB ( hexa-decyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide ) , 0.04 % sodium deoxycholate , and 5.4 l ml 1 - mercaptoethanol . 
To start the reaction , substrate solution containing 60 mM Na2HPO4 , 40 mM NaH2PO4 , 1 mg ml 1 o-nitrophenyl - - D-galactoside ( ONPG ) 1 and 2.7 g ml - mercaptoethanol was added , and the time was measured until sufﬁcient color had been developed . 
The enzyme reaction was then stopped by addition of 1 M sodium carbonate ( Na CO ) , and re-2 3 maining cell fragments were pelleted by centrifugation at full speed . 
The optical density of the supernatant at 405 nm was measured , and Miller units were calculated according to the method of Miller ( 37 ) . 
All samples were normalized against their corresponding arabinose-induced wild-type control in the presence or absence of anhydrotetracycline . 
For statistical analysis , an unpaired t test was performed using the software program GraphPad Prism version 5.0 d for Mac ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 
The P value summaries are displayed above the respective bars . 
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR . 
RNA isolation was performed for three independent biological replicates using the RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen ) . 
For removal of genomic DNA , RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C using a DNA-free RNA kit ( Zymo Research ) or on-column treatment was performed using kit 79254 ( Qiagen ) . 
Subsequently , RNA samples were reverse transcribed according to the RevertAid ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) . 
Quantitative real-time PCRs were carried out using the EvaGreen quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) master mix ( Bio-Rad ) and primers 5 = - TCTCAACGATGCCTTA CCCGAACA plus 5 = - GCAAGCTCATGTAAAGGCGTGTGT ( rﬂM ) , 5 = - CTGCTCAAAGAGCTGGTGTATCA plus 5 = - AGCGCGTTACAGTCTG CTCAT ( gyrB ) , 5 = - CAACCTGTTCGTACGTATCGAC plus 5 = - CAGCTC CATCTGCAGTTTGTTG ( rpoB ) , 5 = - CAACAGTATGCGCGTGATGAT plus 5 = - CGACGCAGAGCTTCATGATC ( rpoD ) , 5 = - TTGCAGAAATGA GCCATTACGCCG plus 5 = - GACGTTCAGC GCGAATGATGGTTT ( gmk ) , 5 = - GTAGGCAGCTTTGCGTGTAG plus 5 = - TCCAGCAGTTGTG GAATAATATCG ( ﬂhDC ) , 5 = - AACGTCTATTTTGTGAAAACCAAAG plus 5 = - AGACTCCAGAATCCCGTTTTC ( ﬂgE ) , and 5 = - AACGACGGTA TCTCCATTGC plus 5 = - ATTTCAGCCTGGATGGAGTC ( ﬂagellin , conserved region of ﬂiC and ﬂjB ) . 
Experiments were performed on a CFX96 real-time PCR instrument ( Bio-Rad ) , with the exception of the experiment leading to Fig. 5 . 
Here we used a Rotor-Gene Q 2plex real-time PCR system ( Qiagen ) . 
Relative changes in mRNA levels were analyzed according to the Pfafﬂ method ( 38 ) and normalized against the transcript levels of the reference genes rpoB , rpoD , gyrB , and gmk . 
Motility plates . 
Motility plates were prepared as described previously ( 30 , 39 ) . 
Strains were picked from fresh individual colonies grown on LB and pocked into 0.2 % arabinose-containing ( Ara ) and arabinose-free ( Ara ) motility agar . 
Plates were kept at 30 °C and grown for 5.5 h ( Ara ) and 6.5 h ( Ara ) , respectively . 
The diameter of the motility swarm was measured using the software program NIH ImageJ 1.44 g . 
In order to increase the contrast between motility and background , contrast levels were equally adjusted using iWork Pages software . 
Flagellar staining . 
For immunostaining of ﬂagellar ﬁlaments , ﬂiC-ON phase-locked ( hin-5717 ) Salmonella bacteria containing a deletion of either rﬂM or rcsB were grown to mid-log phase and immobilized on poly-L-lysine-treated coverslips . 
The bacteria were ﬁxed by addition of 5 % formaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde . 
Membrane staining was performed using FM-64 ( 0.5 mg ml 1 ) . 
Flagella were stained using polyclonal anti-FliC antibodies ( rabbit ) and anti-rabbit-Alexa 488 secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . 
Images were collected using an inverted Axio Observer.Z1 ﬂuorescence microscope ( Zeiss ) .

RESULTS
FlhD4C2 activates its own repressor , RﬂM . 
The master regulatory operon of ﬂagellar gene expression , ﬂhDC , is under autogenous repression ( 13 ) . 
It was reported that increased levels of active 
FlhD4C2 complex resulted in decreased ﬂhDC transcription in cases where 28 ( FliA ) was absent or where 28 was in the presence of its cognate anti- 28 factor FlgM ( 13 ) . 
We conﬁrmed the auto-regulatory effect of FlhD4C2 on ﬂhDC operon transcription in the 28 presence of both and FlgM as shown in Fig. 1 . 
When FlhD C 4 2 was overexpressed from the arabinose promoter upon addition of 0.2 % arabinose , a chromosomal ﬂhC-lac transcriptional fusion under the control of the ﬂhDC promoter reported a drop in ﬂhC-lac expression of about 2-fold ( Fig. 1A ) . 
It was shown previously that tuning expression of FlhD4C2 from the arabinose promoter by addition of 0.05 % to 0.6 % arabinose resulted in a steady 60-fold increase in ﬂhDC mRNA levels compared to ﬂhDC expressed from the native PﬂhDC promoter ( 19 ) . 
In addition , the FlhD4C2 levels needed for maximal activation of downstream ﬂagellar genes appear to be rapidly saturated , since class 2 and class 3 gene expression increased only 3 - to 5-fold in the tested range of ParaﬂhDC overexpression ( 19 ) . 
To address whether FlhD4C2 could directly repress its own transcription or if FlhD4C2 mediated autorepression indirectly by activating the transcription of an unknown ﬂhDC operon repressor , we performed T-POP transposon mutagenesis and screened for potential FlhD4C2-dependent repressors of ﬂhDC gene transcription . 
T-POP transposons are derivatives of transposon Tn10 that can transcribe chromosomal genes adjacent to the site of insertion from tetracycline-inducible promoters within the T-POP element ( 40 ) . 
T-POP lacks transposition functions , which can be provided in trans by a Tn10 transposase expression plasmid pres-ent in recipient cells ( 40 ) . 
After transposon insertions have been isolated and moved into a strain lacking Tn10 transposase , the T-POP transposon is no longer capable of further transposition . 
Strain TH15941 ( araBAD1007 : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC5213 : : MudJ ﬂiA5886 ) carries an ﬂhC-lac transcriptional fusion and the ﬂhD C operon expressed from an arabinose-inducible promoter ( ParaﬂhD C ) . 
This strain is Lac in the presence of arabinose due to FlhD C autorepression . 
The phenotype on lactose 4 2 MacConkey ( MacLac ) agar is shown in Fig. 2 . 
MacLac indicator medium shows the optimal sensitivity in the intermediate lac operon expression range ( 41 ) . 
It thus represents the indicator me-dium of choice to visualize repression of ﬂhDC , such as ﬂhDC autorepression ( ParaﬂhD C ) or repression of ﬂhDC by the known transcriptional regulator RcsB ( PararcsB ) . 
Using MacLac indicator medium , a transition from white ( Lac ) to dark-pink ( Lac ) colonies can be readily observed ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Strain TH15941 was mutagenized with the T-POP transposon Tn10dTc [ del-25 ] and screened for insertions that were Lac ( dark pink ) in the presence of arabinose due to loss of FlhD C autorepression . 
The 4 2 T-POP transposon Tn10dTc [ del-25 ] is deleted for the terminator of the tetA tetracycline resistance gene transcript , allowing transcription from the tetA promoter ( PtetA ) within the T-POP transposon into adjacent chromosomal DNA ( 40 ) . 
Four groups of TPOP transposon insertion mutants that resulted in the apparent loss of FlhD4C2 autorepression ( i.e. , Lac in the presence of arabinose [ Ara-Lac ] ) were obtained . 
One group included T-POP insertions linked to the arabinose region and are presumed to have disrupted the ﬂhDC operon . 
A second group included T-POP insertions linked to the ﬂhC-lac operon fusion and are presumed to be polar insertions between the ﬂhDC promoter and the lac operon inserted in ﬂhC , thereby putting lac directly under PtetA control . 
These two groups of Ara-Lac T-POP insertions in strain TH15941 were not further characterized . 
The remaining two groups of Ara-Lac T-POP insertions were unlinked to both ara and ﬂhC-lac fusion chromosomal positions and represented candidates for insertions in a gene or genes responsible for FlhD4C2-dependent repression of ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
One group included two insertions that exhibited an Ara-Lac phenotype only in the presence of tetracycline ( Tc ) . 
These were presumed to turn on an activator of ﬂhDC gene expression from PtetA that is currently being subjected to further characterization . 
The ﬁnal group of insertion mutants was Ara-Lac in either the presence or absence of added Tc , and their Ara-Lac phenotype was presumed to be due to the loss of function of the gene into which the T-POP was inserted . 
T-POP insertions of this group that were linked to known negative regulators of ﬂhDC expression ( e.g. , lrhA , rtsB , and rcsB ) were not characterized further . 
Of the remaining unlinked T-POP insertions , we sequenced 10 Tc-independent Ara-Lac insertion mutants , and DNA sequence analysis revealed transposition of the T-POP element into the rﬂM locus ( Table 2 ) . 
This indicated that rﬂM encodes an FlhD4C2-induced repressor of ﬂhDC transcription ( the `` autorepressor '' ) . 
RﬂM inhibits ﬂhC gene transcription . 
The results of the random T-POP transposon mutagenesis suggested that RﬂM functions as an FlhD4C2-dependent inhibitor of ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
Accordingly , we tested autoinhibition of ﬂhDC transcription upon induction of P ﬂhD C ara in the absence of the putative regulator RﬂM ( Fig. 1A ) . 
The inhibitory effect of ParaﬂhD C induction on ﬂhDC gene transcription was lost in the rﬂM deletion strain , conﬁrming that RﬂM was responsible for the FlhD4C2 autoregulation effect observed by Kutsukake ( 13 ) . 
In order to conﬁrm that RﬂM represses ﬂhDC operon transcription , we analyzed ﬂhDC mRNA levels in a strain that expresses excess rﬂM from an arabinose-inducible promoter ( P rﬂM ) . 
As ara shown in Fig. 1B , under PararﬂM - inducing conditions , ﬂhDC expression decreased about 4-fold in a reverse transcriptase qPCR ( RT-qPCR ) assay . 
Reduction in ﬂhDC transcription was also observed under P rﬂM - inducing conditions using an ﬂhC-lac ara operon fusion reporter shown in Fig. 1C . 
Effect of RﬂM on rﬂM gene transcription . 
We investigated whether RﬂM was under autogenous control . 
To test if RﬂM autoregulates its own transcription , we utilized a previously isolated rﬂM-lac operon transcriptional fusion ( 30 ) . 
A strain overexpressing RﬂM from the arabinose promoter ( PararﬂM ) was analyzed in comparison to the wild-type control , where the arabinose genes araBAD were deleted by inserting an Flp recombination target ( FRT ) - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-FRT ( FCF ) resistance cassette ( araBAD : : FCF ) . 
Both strains carried the above-men-tioned rﬂM-lac reporter and a T-POP insertion in the promoter region of ﬂhDC . 
The latter allows the activation of ﬂhDC transcription upon addition of anhydrotetracycline ( AnTc ) , which activates T-POP-encoded tetA and tetR gene transcription , and prevents ﬂhDC autorepression . 
As shown in Fig. 1D , the absence of FlhD4C2 ( e.g. , in the absence of the inducer AnTc , the ﬂhDC operon in these strains is not transcribed ) resulted in a reduction of rﬂM-lac transcription , presumably because the rﬂM gene required FlhD4C2 for its transcription . 
However , induction of rﬂM from the arabinose locus had no effect on the remaining rﬂM-lac transcription , suggesting that RﬂM does not play an additional role in its own transcriptional regulation except through regulation of ﬂhDC . 
FlhD4C2 activates its own repressor , RﬂM . 
The results described above indicate that FlhD4C2 activates its own repressor , RﬂM . 
To analyze the effects of ParaﬂhD C induction on rﬂM gene expression , we analyzed - galactosidase activity of a transcriptional rﬂM-lac reporter in Salmonella enterica LT2 and the virulent strain Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028s to exclude strainspeciﬁc effects and in addition analyze a potential cross talk between the interconnected virulence and ﬂagellar gene regulation networks . 
The attenuated strain , LT2 , was grown under regular LB conditions , whereas the virulent strain , 14028s , was grown under high-salt and low-oxygen conditions , known to induce the viru-lence-associated Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) ( 24 , 32 , 33 ) . 
In both strain backgrounds , a 3-fold induction of rﬂM was observed under P ﬂhD ara C - inducing conditions ( Fig. 3A ) . 
We also performed complementary quantitative real-time PCR assays . 
Upon ParaﬂhD C - inducing conditions , the rﬂM mRNA level was signiﬁcantly increased , as shown in Fig. 3B . 
Effect of RﬂM on motility and ﬂagellation . 
We have shown above that overexpression of rﬂM resulted in a substantial repression of the ﬂagellar master regulatory operon , ﬂhDC . 
We therefore analyzed the effect of a deletion of the rﬂM gene and rﬂM overexpression on motility and ﬂagellar assembly . 
A deletion in rﬂM resulted in an increase in motility compared to the wild type ( Fig. 4A and B ) and on average one additional ﬂagellum per cell body ( Fig. 4C ) . 
Under rﬂM-overexpressing conditions ( labeled rﬂM1 ) , a substantial loss of motility was observed and motility was significantly impaired compared to that with the known repressor RcsB ( Fig. 4B ) . 
Additionally , we analyzed gene expression of the three ﬂagellar promoter classes by quantitative real-time PCR . 
Expression of all the classes was upregulated in the rﬂM background , with a decreasing effect along the transcriptional ﬂagellar hierarchy ( Fig. 5 ) . 
While no signiﬁcant difference could be observed between the two regulators RﬂM and RcsB in terms of class 1 ( ﬂhDC ) expression , the RﬂM effect is clearly visible at later class 2 ( ﬂgE ) and class 3 ( ﬂiC and ﬂjB ) transcription . 
This effect supports the observation that the RﬂM effect on motility and ﬂagellation was more pronounced than that of RcsB .

Relative gene expression was determined using the Pfafﬂ method . 
Individual mRNA levels were normalized against those for multiple reference genes ( gmk , gyrB , rpoB , and rpoD ) and are presented as fold change relative to those for the wild-type control , TH6701 araBAD : : tetRA or TH437 LT2 .

In summary , our results support a regulatory feedback loop for the autogenous control of ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
Expression of ﬂhDC leads to production of a functional FlhD4C2 activator complex , which , in addition to activating ﬂagellar class 2 promoter transcription for hook-basal body assembly , activates rﬂM gene transcription . 
RﬂM , when produced , acts to inhibit ﬂhDC transcription . 
We have thereby demonstrated that this feedback loop is responsible for the formerly observed autoregulatory effect of FlhD4C2 .

DISCUSSION
In this study , we show that the formerly observed autoregulatory effect of the ﬂagellar master regulator FlhD4C2 is caused by FlhD4C2-dependent production of a negative regulator , RﬂM . 
FlhD4C2 and RﬂM thereby form a regulatory feedback loop , which regulates the rate of ﬂagellar gene expression with respect to the level of already-initiated ﬂagellar biosynthesis . 
Expression of rﬂM is directly coupled to the presence of functional FlhD4C2 , which could be concluded from the fact that the amount of rﬂM mRNA was signiﬁcantly increased under FlhD4C2 overexpression conditions . 
Conclusively , ﬂhDC expression decreased in the presence of excess RﬂM , and FlhD4C2 autoregulation was completely abolished in an rﬂM deletion background . 
Flagellar synthesis is dependent on a hierarchy of three transcriptional promoter classes , with the master regulator , FlhD4C2 , at the top . 
FlhD4C2 is a known DNA binding complex that has been shown to bind to the 40 to 80 regions of multiple ﬂagellar operons ( 42 , 43 ) and together with 70 targets RNA polymerase to transcribe class 2 ﬂagellar promoters ( 44 ) . 
FlhD4C2 allows expression of the subsequent ﬂagellar genes ( under the control of the FlhD4C2-dependent class 2 promoters ) needed for hook-basal-body assembly . 
The presence of functional FlhD4C2 thereby plays the main role in determining whether or not ﬂagella are synthesized . 
Accordingly , negative feedback between the FlhD4C2 protein and ﬂhDC operon expression would prevent the cell from synthesizing an excess of ﬂagella . 
Overexpression of ﬂhDC has previously been described to turn off ﬂhDC operon transcription and was attributed to a direct inhibition of the ﬂhDC operon by the FlhD4C2 complex ( 13 ) . 
It was unclear , however , whether this inhibitory function was direct or indirect . 
Thus , we designed a genetic selection and screen to differentiate between two possibilities : in addition to the known role of FlhD4C2 as a transcriptional activator of ﬂagellar class 2 promoters , FlhD4C2 could either act as a direct repressor of its own ( ﬂhDC operon ) transcription or as an activator of an unknown repressor of ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
Our results support the latter possibility . 
The identiﬁcation of an FlhD4C2-dependent ﬂhDC regulator allows us to postulate a novel regulatory feedback loop that accounts for the previously described autoregulation of FlhD4C2 . 
The loop consists of two mechanisms : ( i ) FlhD4C2 activates rﬂM and ( ii ) RﬂM represses ﬂhDC transcription . 
With this study , we added a new component to the complex regulatory mechanisms that controls expression and activity of the ﬂagellar master regulator FlhD4C2 . 
Many environmental and regulatory stimuli are integrated at the level of 70-dependent transcription of the ﬂhDC operon . 
Expression of FlhD4C2 therefore forms the prerequisite for the initiation of ﬂagellar synthesis by activation of ﬂagellar class 2 and 3 gene expression . 
Regulation at the level of ﬂhDC operon transcription is thus the main target by which ﬂagellar synthesis is regulated . 
In this study , we further characterized the ﬂhDC master operon regulation that is placed on top of the ﬂagellar gene expression cascade . 
In addition to environmental ( external ) stimuli that control expression of ﬂhDC , an endogenous ( internal ) regulation mechanism that directly provides feedback of 
FlhD4C2 protein levels exists . 
An increase in ﬂhDC expression and the subsequent ﬂagellar synthesis requires a mechanism of counterbalance . 
Such an effect was previously referred to as FlhD4C2 autorepression ( Fig. 6A ) , which our results show to be a regulatory feedback loop via RﬂM . 
A previous study indicated an additional role of the RcsCDB system in the RﬂM-mediated repression of ﬂhDC ( 30 ) . 
The response regulator RcsB has been shown to directly bind to the ﬂhDC promoter region ( 23 , 24 ) . 
Accordingly , different scenarios of RﬂM-dependent repression of ﬂhDC can be envisioned , and follow-up experiments are currently in progress to test the role RcsB in this regulation network . 
RﬂM could directly repress ﬂhDC , while RcsB takes over a supporting role ( Fig. 6B ) . 
Alternatively , RcsB could directly repress ﬂhDC independently of RﬂM , and both proteins might compete for binding to the ﬂhDC promoter region ( Fig. 6C ) . 
Finally , RﬂM could act as a corepressor of RcsB ( Fig. 6D ) . 
The complexity and the hierarchical structure of the ﬂagellar system explain the frequency by which endogenous regulation mechanisms occur . 
Feedback regulation in the ﬂagellar system targets multiple levels throughout biosynthesis of the ﬂagellum : ( i ) on the level of ﬂhDC gene expression via FlhD4C2-dependent activation of the LuxR-type repressor RﬂM , ( ii ) on the level of FlhDC protein complex via posttranscriptional repression ( FliT and YdiV ) and activation ( FliZ ) of FlhDC-dependent class 2 gene expression , and ( iii ) on the level of ﬂagellar class 3 gene expression by secretion of the anti- 28 factor FlgM after HBB completion and positive regulation of ﬂgM translation by FlgN ( 45 -- 47 ) . 
In summary , the following scenario could be envisioned to couple the assembly process of the ﬂagellum to ﬂagellar gene expression . 
70-dependent class 1 transcription of ﬂhDC leads to formation of the ﬂagellar master regulatory complex FlhD4C2 . 
FlhD4C2 activates class 2 gene transcription , as well as that of its own repressor , rﬂM . 
While class 2 products build up the HBB , FliZ activates FlhDC complex and RﬂM acts as a repressor of ﬂhDC transcription . 
Upon completion of the HBB , the secretion speciﬁcity switch results in secretion of FlgM and FliD , and class 3 gene expression takes place . 
Secretion of FliD upon HBB completion allows FliT to bind FlhDC complex and inhibit FlhD C activity . 
Reduced activ-4 2 ity of FlhDC decreases expression of rﬂM and allows a new cycle of ﬂagellar gene expression and assembly starting with derepression of the ﬂhDC promoter . 
FIG 6 Possible models of the regulatory ﬂhDC feedback loop . 
Panel A shows the formerly described autoregulatory effect of ﬂhDC , where FlhD4C2 directly represses ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
In contrast to this previous model , FlhD4C2 induces expression of rﬂM , and the RﬂM protein acts as a repressor of ﬂhDC transcription . 
Repression of RﬂM might be direct but facilitated by RcsB ( B ) . 
Alternatively , RﬂM might repress ﬂhDC independently of RcsB ( C ) or act as a corepressor of RcsB ( D ) .
