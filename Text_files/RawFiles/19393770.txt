Article history : 
The genus Salmonella consists of two species S. enterica and S. bongori . 
S. enterica has a well deﬁned subspecies structure with seven subspecies consistently delineated by sequence variation . 
Frequency of recombination between subspecies and within a subspecies is markedly different . 
Subspecies I undergoes frequent recombination as demonstrated recently , demystifying the long-held belief that Salmonella is a highly clonal organism . 
The majority of disease causing serovars are from subspecies I with the most important serovars in human health being Typhimurium and Typhi . 
Typhimurium has developed considerable diversity and may be a very old serovar . 
The majority of the isolates belong to a single clonal complex by multilocus sequence typing . 
Typhimurium isolates are divided into phage types and some of the phage types do not have a single origin as determined using mutational changes . 
Phage type DT104 is heterogeneous and represented in multiple sequence types , with its multidrug-resistant variant most successful causing epidemics in many parts of the world . 
Typhi , a human restricted serovar , is relatively young compared to Typhimurium , and has a low level of sequence variation . 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have been shown to be very useful for typing and resolving relationships within Typhi . 
Genome sequences of 19 isolates revealed more than 1700 SNPs . 
The fully resolved phylogenetic tree allows one to trace the mutational changes occurred during clonal diversiﬁcation . 
Genome wide SNPs have greatly enhanced our understanding of the evolution of Salmonella clones .

1. Introduction
The genus Salmonella consists of two species S. enterica and S. bongori . 
Both species have the capacity to invade host cells due to the presence of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 ( SPI1 ) , but only S. enterica has the capacity for systemic spread due to the presence of SPI2 ( Groisman and Ochman , 1997 ; Hensel , 2000 ) . 
However , Salmonella is quite variable and only some forms are characteristically pathogenic . 
Salmonella is best known over much of the world , for its capacity to cause human food poisoning . 
When Salmonella passes through the food chain from one of the domestic animals , humans can become an accidental host , causing a usually short term enterocolitis , named salmonellosis . 
Salmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne bacterial infections worldwide , with the US alone having an estimated 1.4 million cases , resulting in 17,000 hospitalizations and almost 600 deaths each year ( Voetsch et al. , 2004 ) . 
Serovar Typhimurium was for many years the most commonly isolated serovar globally , and the spread of the multidrug-resistant DT104 clone is a major public health concern 
( Threlfall et al. , 1994 ; Helms et al. , 2005 ) . 
However in recent years , serovar Enteritidis has outnumbered Typhimurium in the Eur-opean Union and many other areas ( de Jong and Ekdahl , 2006 ; Galanis et al. , 2006 ) . 
Some serovars are host speciﬁc or conﬁned to a small number of hosts . 
Serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A cause enteric fever exclusively in humans . 
Typhoid fever remains a devastating disease in several regions in Asia , Africa and South America , while the disease is rare in developed countries . 
The global burden was estimated to be more than 21 million cases and 200,000 deaths in 2000 ( Crump et al. , 2004 ) . 
The 2004 -- 2005 outbreak of typhoid fever in Kinshasa , Congo involved 42,564 cases and 214 deaths ( WHO , 2005 ) . 
Although much less common than typhoid fever , paratyphoid fever which is caused by serovar Paratyphi A , is also a signiﬁcant disease . 
There were more than 5 million cases in 2000 ( Crump et al. , 2004 ) , and paratyphoid fever is becoming a problem in Asian countries ( Ochiai et al. , 2005 ) . 
Recent studies on the evolution of Typhi have made signiﬁcant advances ( Roumagnac et al. , 2006 ; Octavia and Lan , 2007 ; Holt et al. , 2008 ) but there is little information on Paratyphi A. Salmonella serovars are distinguished by antisera to two highly variable surface antigens , the O antigen reﬂecting variation in the exposed part of the lipopolysaccharide , and the H antigen , reﬂecting variation in ﬂagellin , the major protein of the ﬂagellum , with about 46 and 114 recognised antigenic forms , respectively ( Grimont and Weill , 2007 ; McQuiston et al. , 2004 ) . 
Most Salmonella carry two ﬂagellin genes that code for H1 and H2 variants of the H antigen . 
Isolates are identiﬁed by serotyping , with more than 2500 serovars ( each a unique combination of O , H1 and H2 antigens ) reported ( Grimont and Weill , 2007 ) . 
Most of the serovars were initially given Latin binomial species names , and these have been retained as serovar names ( Le Minor and Popoff , 1987 ; Brenner et al. , 2000 ) . 
For example , the original S. typhimurium is now referred to as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium or simply Typhimurium ( the latter convention is used in this review ) . 
The Salmonella serovars were classiﬁed into seven subspecies ( I , II , IIIa , IIIb , IV , V and VI ) , based on DNA hybridization and biotyping studies ( Crosa et al. , 1973 ; Le Minor et al. , 1986 ) . 
An eighth group , designated as subspecies VII , was identiﬁed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis ( MLEE ) analysis , but currently contains only four isolates of two serovars initially allocated to subspecies IV on the basis of biochemical characteristics ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) . 
This probably an underestimation as these subspecies were not distinguished by the traits used in the earlier studies , and only 23 of the 71 subspecies IV serovars were examined by MLEE . 
The relationships of the S. enterica subspecies appear to have been ﬁnally resolved by using four housekeeping genes and 67 isolates ( McQuiston et al. , 2008 ) , with only one minor topological difference from an earlier sequence based tree ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) . 
There has been considerable confusion on Salmonella nomenclature but the situation has been clariﬁed by the JCICSP ( 2005 ) and subsequent commentaries on taxonomy ( Heyndrickx et al. , 2005 ; Tindall et al. , 2005 ) . 
It is now quite clear that the type species of the genus is S. enterica , with six named subspecies : enterica ( subspecies I ) , arizonae ( IIIa ) , diarizonae ( IIIb ) , houtenae ( IV ) , indica ( VI ) , and salamae ( II ) , with the original subspecies V becoming S. bongori . 
Subspecies VII was not recognised . 
However at the sequence level it is as distinct as some other subspecies , but there is no phenotypic description or taxonomic name yet . 
These recommendations are consistent with earlier recommendations ( Brenner et al. , 2000 ) . 
This review discusses the diversity and the population structure of S. enterica , particularly subspecies I , and the evolution and epidemiology of the two major pathogenic serovars Typhimurium and Typhi .

Serovarsc 
2. Diversity of S. enterica
S. enterica is found in reptiles and warm-blooded vertebrates . 
Most subspecies are only commonly isolated from reptiles , and are often not disease associated , but subspecies I has far more serovars than the others and these are generally isolated from mammals or birds . 
Ninety-nine percent of salmonellosis is due to subspecies I serovars , with 70 % caused by only 12 serovars ( Anjum et al. , 2005 ) . 
Therefore , only a small fraction of serovars within subspecies I is pathogenic in this sense . 
Most serovars are not pathogenic in their natural hosts although a range of serovars can cause disease in domestic animals , and some speciﬁc to a particular host ( Wray and Wray , 2000 ) . 
There is a considerable overlap between human and farm animal serovars ( Alcaine et al. , 2006 ; Foley et al. , 2008 ) , but the frequencies are different . 
The top three in human infections in 2005 in the US are Typhimurium , Enteritidis and Newport , accounting for nearly half of the human infections . 
In non-human isolations , the top three are Heidelberg , Typhimurium and Kentucky , accounting for 40 % of the total non-clinical isolations ( CDC , 2007 ) . 
The frequencies may be different in different regions . 
In Australia , the top three human serovars are Typhimurium , Virchow and Saintpaul while the farm animal serovars are Typhimurium , Dublin and Bovismorbiﬁcans ( Powling , 2005 ) . 
Genetic diversity within S. enterica natural populations , in particular subspecies I serovars , was extensively analysed by MLEE in the late 1980s ( Beltran et al. , 1988 , 1991 ; Reeves et al. , 1989 ; Selander et al. , 1991 ) . 
Many serovars were found to be conﬁned within a single cluster of closely related electrophoretic types ( ETs ) , where each has a predominant widely distributed ET ( Beltran et al. , 1988 , 1991 ; Selander et al. , 1990b ; Selander and Smith , 1990 ) . 
However some serovars are genotypically heterogeneous , for example Derby and Newport include divergent isolates with ETs clustered distantly in MLEE trees . 
Clearly , these serovars comprise two or more clones that probably gained the same antigenic properties independently . 
However , the focus was on the frequently isolated serovars , with about 30 of the 1500 subspecies I serovars looked at in population genetics terms . 
Three widely used Salmonella strain collections , SARA ( Beltran et al. , 1991 ) , SARB ( Boyd et al. , 1993 ) and SARC ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) , were based on the MLEE data , and include representative strains of Typhimurium , subspecies I , and the eight subspecies , respectively . 
Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) analysis showed sequence level diversity in some serovars ( Torpdahl et al. , 2005 ; Harbottle et al. , 2006 ) , with strong support for the division into subspecies ( Falush et al. , 2006 ; McQuiston et al. , 2008 ) . 
There are 368 isolates belonging to 111 sequence types ( STs ) for subspecies I from the publicly available MLST data ( note that under the policy of the Salmonella MLST database ( http://mlst.ucc.ie/ mlst/dbs/Senterica ) , only the published data is freely available for publication and the following analysis relates to that component ) , and using eBURST ( Feil et al. , 2004 ) , with six out of seven genes identical as the deﬁnition of a clonal complex , we grouped 60 STs into 20 clonal complexes with an average of three STs per clonal complex ( ranging from two to nine STs , Table 1 ) , leaving 51 singletons . 
Three clonal complexes , ST27 , 39 , and 42 clonal complexes , contain more than one serovar . 
We constructed a neighbour-joining tree , using a representative ST for each of the 20 clonal complexes , reducing the number to 71 STs . 
The tree is shown in Fig. 1 . 
It should be noted that , however , the relationships are not robust as indicated by bootstrap values which gave suppor

only to closely related branches , which is due to frequent recombination within subspecies I as discussed below . 
There are 11 serovars , Choleraesuis , Derby , Dublin , Enteritidis , Infantis , Muenchen , Newport , Paratyphi B , Saintpaul , Typhimurium and Wien , which may have more than one origin as not all the STs from each of these serovars are grouped together ( Fig. 1 ) . 
It seems clear that not all serovars comprise a single clone , and this is important in terms of epidemiology . 
As noted before ( Falush et al. , 2006 ) Typhi diverged early and has no close relative . 
Some serovars appear to be more diverse than others , but this may be inﬂuenced by sampling bias . 
Newport is the largest and most diverse , with 14 STs and two clonal complexes comprising seven STs in the ST118 clonal complex , ﬁve STs in the ST45 clonal complex , and three singletons . 
Typhimurium is second with 12 STs but it will be discussed separately below . 
Paratyphi B has six STs with two clonal complexes , one comprising three STs in the ST86 clonal complex while the other forms a clonal complex with a Dublin ST. The MLEE ET Pb1 identiﬁed by Selander et al. ( 1990a ) is the only enteric fever causing clone . 
Pb1 is in ST86 which is in the ST86 clonal complex , the major clonal complex of Paratyphi B . 
It remains to be determined whether only and/or all ST86 isolates cause enteric fever . 
Choleraesuis has four STs with two STs in the same lineage while the remaining two STs are in different lineages ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Choleraesuis is generally believed to have host-adapted to pigs and causes swine paratyphoid but can also be isolated from human infections ( Chiu et al. , 2004 ) . 
The ST diversity of Choleraesuis raises the question of how many of the lineages are adapted to pigs . 
Enteritidis has three STs ( ST6 , 11 and 77 ) with the majority of the isolates in ST11 . 
ST11 is also closely related to Gallinarum ( ST78 clonal complex ) and Pullorum ( ST92 ) on the tree ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The latter two are poultry speciﬁc pathogens , with Pullorum a biovar of serovar Gallinarum . 
Note that the genome sequenced Gallinarum strain is ST331 belonging to the ST78 complex . 
Enteritidis is also most frequently isolated from chickens . 
It is likely that some forms of Enteritidis are already adapted to chickens but Gallinarum and Pullorum have undergone further host restriction . 
Furthermore , it is likely that this adaptation occurred in the ST11 clonal complex . 
The recent genome comparison of an Enteritidis genome ( ST11 ) and Gallinarum genome ( ST331 ) showed massive inactivation of genes in the Gallinarum genome ( Thomson et al. , 2008 ) . 
Such a genome reduction trend has also been observed in other host restricted pathogens including Typhi ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ) . 
It should be noted that Gallinarum and Pullorum have the same O antigen as Enteritidis , but lack the H antigens , so all three probably originally in the same serovar , but with H1 and H2 inactivated in two of them . 
The ﬂjBA operon is absent in both Enteritidis and Gallinarum genomes , which explains the absence of H2 ( note that some Enteritidis strains express H2 ) , while the ﬂiC locus ( ﬂiC was annotated as ﬂjB in the two genomes ) is intact in both . 
In the Gallinarum genome , a deletion of 197 bp in ﬂhB and a frameshift mutation in ﬂhA were found . 
FlhB is a critical protein in the switch to export rod/hook or ﬂagellin ( Ferris and Minamino , 2006 ) and the deletion presumably blocks this switch in speciﬁcity . 
Clearly the MLST data provided a better overview of Salmonella diversity , and this can only improve as more MLST data become publicly available . 
MLST also provides a better basis for typing and understanding the evolution of Salmonella clones and pathogeni-city . 
Serovars with multiple STs , in particular those with multiple origins , require a combination of serotyping and MLST to better deﬁne the clones . 
In addition , adaptation can clearly occur within a serovar , for example within Typhimurium as discussed above , making genome comparison much more informative if appropriate STs , for example , adapted versus non - or less-adapted STs , are compared

Population structures of S. enterica at species and subspecies I levels 
The population structure of S. enterica was proposed to be clonal on the basis of MLEE data , with strong linkage disequilibrium characterised by non-random associations between the alleles of the 24 metabolic enzyme loci studied ( Beltran et al. , 1988 , 1991 ; Reeves et al. , 1989 ; Selander et al. , 1991 ) . 
A low recombination rate has also been inferred from sequence data of six housekeeping genes from the 16 SARC strains , for which gene trees for the six housekeeping genes are largely congruent ( Nelson et al. , 1991 , 1997 ; Nelson and Selander , 1992 , 1994 ; Boyd et al. , 1994 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) . 
These ﬁndings lead to the conclusion that S. enterica has one of the highest levels of clonality among bacterial species . 
However it has since become clear that recombination between subspecies I strains is not uncommon . 
We recently analysed the genetic relationships of S. enterica subspecies I strains using nucleotide sequences of six genes , four ( mglA , proV , torC , and speC ) sequenced by Octavia and Lan ( 2006 ) and two ( mdh and mutS ) by Brown et al. ( 2003 ) . 
Fifteen SARB strains from 13 serovars were analysed . 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed an unexpected lack of congruence among the six gene trees . 
Split decomposition analysis , which accommodates recombination in visualization of relationships , resolved ﬁve strains with a network structure indicating relationships with recombination , while other strains showed a star phylogeny , indicating that no relationships were observed with conﬁdence , consistent with extensive recombination masking the relationships , although this is not the only explanation . 
A number of other analyses conﬁrmed the overall conclusion that the genes studied have undergone frequent recombination , suggesting a low level of clonality within subspecies I . 
The MLST data discussed above ( Falush et al. , 2006 ) also provided evidence for substantial recombination within subspecies I , and the range of sequence variation observed among genes within pairwise comparisons of S. enterica subspecies I genomes indicated a high level of recombination within the subspecies ( Didelot et al. , 2007 ) . 
It should be noted that the new conclusions are not inconsistent with the earlier data , as the use of only two isolates for each subspecies in earlier studies ( Boyd et al. , 1996 ) meant that only recombination between subspecies would be readily apparent . 
The extensive conﬂicting phylogenetic signals within subspecies I are best shown in Fig. 2 . 
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-net method ( Bryant and Moulton , 2004 ) based on the MLST data of 59 strains from the SARB collection representing the diversity of subspecies I . 
We simpliﬁed the tree by removing 13 strains differing by one or fewer alleles . 
The tree shows a network structure suggesting extensive recombination . 
This low level of clonality is unlikely to be restricted to subspecies I , and similar low levels of clonality are expected within other subspecies . 
Therefore , Salmonella has a hierarchical population structure with a high level of recombination and hence low level of clonality within subspecies . 
However , as there is little recombination between subspecies , this was not detected in early studies .

4. Evolution and diversity of Typhimurium
4.1. Genetic diversity
Typhimurium is a signiﬁcant human pathogen worldwide and there is considerable genetic diversity within the serovar . 
An MLEE analysis using 20 enzymes and over 300 isolates ( Beltran et al. , 1991 ) found 23 electrophoretic types ( ETs ) . 
The majority of isolates , including strain LT2 , belong to ET Tm1 and all Typhimurium ETs were found to be grouped together with a number of other serovars in a group called the Typhimurium clonal complex ( Beltran et al. , 1991 ) . 
This picture is conﬁrmed by MLST . 
The 46 Typhimurium isolates publicly available in the Salmonella MLST database are grouped into 12 STs . 
Nine STs belong to a single clonal complex with ST19 as the founder ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Eight STs differ from ST19 by one allele . 
The single allele difference in each variant is due to either a single base change ( six cases ) or two to ﬁve base changes ( two cases ) . 
This gives a mutation to recombination ratio of 3 to 1 . 
There are however three singletons , all of which differ by more than two alleles from the clonal complex and from each other . 
The whole MLST tree for subspecies I ( Fig. 1 ) indicates that these singleton STs are of independent origins . 
ST19 is the most frequent ST ( 74 % of the isolates ) and the ST19 clonal complex contains 93 % of the Typhimurium isolates in the database . 
The diversity of Typhimurium is also reﬂected by the large number of phage types reported . 
Phage types are determined by resistance or sensitivity to a set of 34 phages developed in the 1970s to establish the Anderson phage-typing scheme ( Anderson et al. , 1977 ) . 
There are 209 deﬁnitive phage types ( referred to as DTs ) , and phage typing is commonly used in epidemiological surveillance of Typhimurium infections to follow the distribution and the rise and fall of different forms . 
However some DTs are rare and a few tend to dominate within a region for signiﬁcant periods of time . 
For example , multidrug-resistant DT104 ( see below ) has become a widespread pathogen in humans and animals in Europe and the US since 1994 ( Low et al. , 1997 ; Glynn et al. , 1998 ) , while remaining rare in Australia ; whereas DT9 , DT135 and DT170/108 are dominant in Australia ( Powling , 2005 ) , but DT9 is rare in Europe and the US . 
Phage typing also gives us a means to identify Typhimurium strains from different sources . 
Most phage types have a broad host range including humans , farm livestock , domestic fowl , rodents and birds , whereas some Typhimurium variants have a very narrow host range such as the pigeon-adapted variant , DT2 ( Baumler et al. , 1998 ; Rabsch et al. , 2002 ) .

Strain names for all phage types are removed . 
Shown at the terminal is phage type followed by number of strains studied in brackets . 
The genome sequence strains were mapped on to the tree with respective strain names except for DT2 which has no strain name available . 
4.2. Relationships of phage types
Phage typing clearly demonstrates the diversity of Typhimur-ium and provides important epidemiological information . 
However , the relationships between phage types can not be inferred from the phage sensitivity patterns . 
Phage types can change with rather few genetic modiﬁcations , often involving a gain or loss of mobile elements . 
Conversion of DT9 to DT64 and DT135 to DT16 are both mediated by the addition of phage ST64T ( Mmolawa et al. , 2002 ) . 
Therefore strains of a given phage type may not even have a common origin and , importantly , it is possible that a newly dominant phage type may have arisen by change in phage sensitivity pattern in a strain of different phage type already dominant in the area , and not be related to previous isolates of the new phage type . 
For example , it appears that multidrug-resistant DT12 and DT120 isolates of the 1990s , with a resistance pattern similar to that of the then current major DT104 form , are derived from the epidemic DT104 form rather than due to transfer of the drug resistance pattern to DT12 and DT120 strains ( Lawson et al. , 2002 ) . 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and other single step mutational , or sometimes recombinational , difference markers are the most valuable for studying evolutionary relationships of isolates in homogenous pathogenic clones ( Achtman et al. , 2004 ; Pearson et al. , 2004 ; Filliol et al. , 2006 ) . 
We recently addressed the issue of the relationships of Typhimurium phage types using mutational changes , mostly SNPs ( Hu et al. , 2006 ) , since the majority of Typhimurium isolates belong to a small number of STs , and thus MLST is not useful to resolve the relationships within Typhimurium ( see also Fakhr et al. ( 2005 ) ) . 
Suitable mutational changes were found through two means , matching polymorphic ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism ( AFLP ) fragments to the LT2 genome to pinpoint base changes , and by sequencin intergenic ( IG ) regions of selected strains . 
Fifty-one polymorphic sites were found , mostly in different genes or IG regions , and were used to determine the relationships of 46 Typhimurium isolates of nine phage types ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Note that these isolates were not MLST typed so not related to STs . 
The mutation-based tree has a very high level of consistency , and shows that for seven of the nine phage types used , the isolates studied have a single origin . 
However , for two of the phage types ( DT1 and DT44 ) , there is more than one independent origin . 
We included four additional strains in Fig. 3B , based on genome sequences , DT104 strain NCTC13348 , a DT2 pigeon isolate , SL1344 , and D23580 , being sequenced at the Sanger Centre . 
The DT2 strain was identical for all markers to two of the DT135 strains ; SL1344 of unknown phage type is on the DT44 lineage and next to the other DT135 strains ; D23580 of unknown phage type shares a common ancestor with DT9 and DT64 ; and DT104 is closely related to DT12 . 
The published genome sequence was used to include strain LT2 , a DT4 strain ( Rabsch et al. , 2004 ) , and is identical to DT141 at all 51 polymorphic sites . 
It is important to know the relationships of strains to understand the evolutionary signiﬁcance of functional and genetic differences , as comparison with the most closely related strains gives the best data for interpretation of adaptive changes . 
For example , comparison of a DT135 strain with the DT2 strain will help elucidate how DT2 has adapted to pigeons . 
4.3. Evolution of DT104, the worldwide epidemic phage type
DT104 is one of the best-studied phage types because it causes epidemics around the world and can even be regarded as pandemic . 
DT104 was ﬁrst reported in 1960s , and then appeared in a multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) form in the early 1980s in Britain ( Threlfall , 2000 ) . 
MDR DT104 has now spread globally and is common in many parts of the world including many European countries , the US , Canada , and Asian countries such as Japan and Korea ( Helms et al. , 2005 ) . 
However , Australia and New Zealand have had few MDR DT104 human infections , mostly from travellers ( Helms et al. , 2005 ) . 
The MDR variant seems to have not established itself in livestock in Australia , probably due to strict quarantine on animals , and infected humans have not come into contact with host animals . 
However the threat of it becoming established still remains . 
The success of DT104 is generally attributed to its multidrug resistance , including resistance to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfonamides , and tetracycline ( ACSSuT ) ( Mulvey et al. , 2006 ) , and its ability to readily acquire additional resistance to other clinically important antimicrobial drug classes ( Helms et al. , 2005 ) . 
The genes for these multiple resistances are in a cluster known as the Salmonella Genomic Island 1 ( SGI1 ) ( Mulvey et al. , 2006 ) . 
SGI1 is 43 kb in size encoding 44 open reading frames ( ORFs ) . 
In addition to drug resistance genes , there are also genes homologous to those involved in DNA recombination , replication , conjugal transfer and regulation . 
SGI1 functions as an integrative mobilisable element ( Doublet et al. , 2005 ) . 
SGI1 includes ORFs with homology to regulatory genes , and these may play a signiﬁcant role in the expression of other genes as when introduced into LT2 , SGI1 affected global gene expression ( Golding et al. , 2007 ) . 
Twenty-two chromosomal genes were upregulated including iron and sialic acid utilization genes , while 15 were down-regulated , included genes involved in chemotaxis and motility . 
DT104 is not genetically homogenous and was found in four STs ( ST19 , 40 , 153 and 209 ) with the majority being in ST19 . 
All except ST40 belong to the ST19 clonal complex as described above . 
ST40 differs from ST19 by six loci and is represented by a single isolate . 
However , the MDR DT104 probably has a single origin within ST19 as 13 isolates typed by Cooke et al. ( 2008 ) belonged to the same ST. 
Matiasovicova et al. ( 2007 ) found that all MDR DT104 isolates carry a deletion that includes the genes for ability to utilize allantoin . 
The same deletion is observed in several DT104 isolates that lack SGI1 and this form is proposed to be ancestral to the MDR DT104 . 
It is unclear whether this distribution is due to the loss of SGI1 , but the presence of the speciﬁc deletion strongly supports their suggestion for a single origin . 
The location of the DT104 genome strain in the Typhimurium phage type tree ( Fig. 3B ) suggests that this DT104 clone is related to DT12a . 
The dendrogram based on pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis data given in Lawson et al. ( 2002 ) also supports a close relationship for DT104 and DT12 . 
MDR DT104 may also have acquired other virulence factors , perhaps before gaining SGI1 . 
It harbours prophage ST104 ( Tanaka et al. , 2004 ; Hermans et al. , 2005 ) , which includes two putative toxin genes ( artAB ) encoding an ADP-ribosyl transferase toxin homologue , that may contribute to its virulence ( Saitoh et al. , 2005 ) . 
Although there is no evidence that MDR DT104 is more invasive in tissue culture invasion assays ( Carlson et al. , 2000 ) and genes unique to MDR . 
DT104 may impact on other aspects of pathogenicity ( Kang et al. , 2006 ) . 
These studies demonstrate that there have been major genomic changes giving DT104 its epidemic abilities . 
An MDR DT104 isolate has now been sequenced ( Cooke et al. , 2008 ) . 
Apart from SG1 and prophage ST104 , there are four prophages in the DT104 genome in comparison to LT2 . 
Two of the prophages were present in all 13 isolates examined and two variably present ( Cooke et al. , 2008 ) . 
5. Evolution of serovar Typhi
Typhi is a distinctive and homogeneous serovar with no known close relative among the common serovars . 
MLEE analysis of 334 worldwide isolates gave ﬁve ETs ( Selander et al. , 1996 ) . 
Eighty-two percent were in ET1 and 16 % , all from western Africa , in ET2 . 
MLST of 26 isolates , including two strains representing the major ETs , identiﬁed four STs ( Kidgell et al. , 2002 ) . 
Typhi has been estimated to be at least 10,000 -- 50,000-year old ( Kidgell et al. , 2002 ; Roumagnac et al. , 2006 ) based on the sequence variation , but there is recent evidence that this approach can overestimate divergence times ( Feng et al. , 2008 ) . 
5.1. Relationships of Typhi isolates
As discussed above SNPs are extremely useful for studying pathogenic clones , and were applied to Typhi isolates by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) and Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) . 
The major challenge is ﬁnding SNPs for such purposes . 
Octavia and Lan explored the two completed genomes of Typhi strains CT18 and Ty2 ( Parkhill et al. , 2001 ; Deng et al. , 2003 ) for SNPs . 
The disadvantage of sourcing SNPs from comparison of only two genomes is that they can only reveal the evolutionary path separating Ty2 and CT18 , due to phylogenetic discovery bias ( Pearson et al. , 2004 ) . 
The study by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) took the more laborious approach of surveying 200 gene fragments from over 100 Typhi isolates for variation and found 88 BiPs ( biallellic polymorphisms ) aka SNPs . 
This direct approach circumvented the phylogenetic discovery bias problem , but both gave good data on the origins of Typhi . 
Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) selected 37 SNPs that can be differentiated by the presence or absence of a restriction enzyme site , and used them for the analysis of a collection of 73 worldwide Typhi isolates that were grouped into 23 SNP proﬁles . 
Twelve proﬁles were represented by only one isolate , including the proﬁles of CT18 and Ty2 . 
The remaining 11 proﬁles were shared by two or more isolates , SNP proﬁle 10 being the largest with 23 isolates . 
The SNP proﬁles were divided into four major clusters . 
The division between clusters is supported by alleles unique to or uniforml present in the clusters , suggesting that these are genuine genetic groups . 
The minimum spanning tree of the 23 proﬁles showed that SNP proﬁle 10 is the ancestral proﬁle connecting to the outgroup of non-Typhi serovars , indicating that cluster III arose ﬁrst and the other three clusters emerged from cluster III . 
Parallel changes were also observed in six SNPs across two or more independent lineages due to either mutation or recombination . 
The SNPs allowed determination of the position of the last common ancestor of Typhi and node positions for the SNP proﬁles but except for those involving Ty2 and CT18 , the true branch length of the SNP proﬁles could not be determined . 
The 88 SNPs used by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) divided the 105 global Typhi isolates into 59 haplotypes , and grouped them into ﬁve major clusters . 
However , only 16 of these SNPs were phylogenetically informative , but 4 of them ( BiP 33 , 36 , 48 and 56 ) were useful to divide the identiﬁed haplotypes into ﬁve major clusters . 
The distribution pattern was fully parsimonious with all data ﬁtting a single tree . 
The ancestor was easily identiﬁed as in the Typhimurium phage type study by comparison with the other S. enterica genome sequences . 
However despite the large number of SNPs used , each of the ﬁve clusters was supported by a single SNP only and there is little resolution of relationships within a cluster . 
With the advance of sequencing technology and reduction of costs , the best approach to reveal all SNPs and get a full resolution of relationships of isolates is now genome sequencing , and 19 Typhi isolates selected from the ﬁve major clusters found by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) were later sequenced to 5 -- 65-fold coverage using 454 and/or Solexa sequencing ( Holt et al. , 2008 ) . 
Excluding differences in repetitive regions of the genomes , 1963 SNPs were identiﬁed with only 176 lacking data for one or more isolates , yielding a fully resolved phylogenetic tree with an accurate measure of branch length ( Fig. 4 ) . 
For example the ancestral haplotypes ( H45 , H50 , H42 , H52 and H58 ) of the ﬁve clusters , previously without branch lengths ( Roumagnac et al. , 
2006 ) are now resolved with 188 , 153 , 93 and 12 SNPs , respectively . 
Also 26 reverse or parallel changes in 12 branches can be unambiguously identiﬁed . 
As can be seen in Fig. 4 , three of the four BiPs dividing the major clusters ( Roumagnac et al. , 2006 ) are located on internal branches with the largest number of mutations of 146 , 46 , 88 SNPs for the BiP36 , 56 , and 33 branches , respectively . 
There is a good coverage of BiPs in other major internal nodes ( e.g. , the internal branches with 31 , 73 and 42 SNPs ) . 
In view of the length ( number of SNPs ) of these branches , the BiPs would also be valuable for allocating isolates into clusters . 
We also mapped 30 of the 37 SNPs used by Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) onto the genomic tree ( Holt et al. , 2008 ) ( the others were among the incomplete genome SNPs or not listed as SNPs in the new study ) . 
Seven SNPs were mapped onto the internal nodes as seen on the tree . 
SNP37 ( a new SNP not present in CT18 or Ty2 ) was mapped onto the external node of E98-3139 . 
SNP13 was mapped onto two nodes ( a case of parallel changes ) : the internal node to H58 cluster and the external node to Ty2 . 
Four ( SNPs 1 , 23 , 27 , and 29 ) and 17 SNPs ( 2 -- 7 , 9 -- 10 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 26 , 28 , and 30 -- 33 ) were mapped on to the external nodes of Ty2 and CT18 , respectively . 
The phylogenetic discovery bias is apparent on the tree as only two SNPs cover branches outside the path . 
However the SNPs did provide good resolution along the path for the isolates studied by Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) . 
The clustering observed in the earlier work by Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) could be related to those observed by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) and are also indicated on the tree in Fig. 4 . 
The differentiation of the isolates was assisted by several reverse or parallel changes although these changes led to conﬂicting phylogenetic relationships . 
5.2. Origin of isolates expressing z66 ﬂagellar antigen
Most Typhi isolates are monophasic with the expression of the ﬂagellar antigen encoded by ﬂiC at the H1 locus , but Indonesian 
Fig. 4 . 
Genomic relationships of 19 genome sequenced Typhi isolates . 
The tree was constructed using data from Holt et al. ( 2008 ) and the maximum parsimony method and has the same topology as Holt et al. ( 2008 ) . 
The 1786 SNPs were allocated to the branches as marked , with majority on terminal branches . 
The BiPs used by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) and the SNPs used by Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) are mapped on to the internal nodes . 
BiP48 , a cluster division SNP , and SNP17 , both on external branches are also marked . 
Numbers in brackets on the terminal nodes are reverse or parallel changes observed on the given branch . 
The major cluster divisions based on Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) were indicated on the right by roman numerals . 
The asterisk after the SNP number indicates that the SNP has undergone parallel or reverse change 
Typhi isolates have an additional ﬂagellar antigen , z66 , ﬁrst described in 1981 ( Guinee et al. , 1981 ) . 
The earlier hypothesis was that Typhi ﬁrst adapted to humans in Indonesia and was initially diphasic with a typical H2 ﬂjBA locus encoding the z66 ﬂagellar antigen before spreading globally from Indonesia ( Frankel et al. , 1989 ) . 
However the z66 ﬂagellar antigen is not encoded by the usual ﬂjB gene in a ﬂjBA H2 operon , but by a gene in a ﬂjBA-like operon on a linear plasmid pBSSSB1 ( Baker et al. , 2007 ) . 
The sequence is quite divergent from other S. enterica sequences and the operon lacks the invertible element involved in phase change ( Huang et al. , 2004 ) . 
This suggests that it has been acquired secondarily . 
It was also shown that under selection for loss of z66 from a z66 + strain , the plasmid is maintained and reversion to expression of ﬂiC involves a deletion at the right end of pBSSSB1 ( Baker et al. , 2007 ) , leading to unidirectional change of the H antigen `` phase '' . 
The studies by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) and Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) included z66 isolates and drew similar conclusions on their origin . 
However , it should be noted that two isolates , CDC1196-74 and CDC3434-73 , listed as z66 positive but not falling into the z66 cluster in Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) are z66 negative by PCR typing in Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) . 
Among the 73 Typhi isolates studied by Octavia and Lan ( 2007 ) , 18 carry the z66 antigen . 
The z66 isolates were grouped into four SNP proﬁles as one cluster but there are also some isolates within the cluster that do not have the z66 antigen , presumably having lost the antigen through either loss of the plasmid or the mechanism as described above . 
The presence of the z66 ﬂagellar antigen in only one cluster suggests that Typhi was originally monophasic , having only an H1 antigen , and then one lineage gained a new phase-2-ﬂagellin-like operon locked in the `` on '' phase . 
The genome tree of 19 Typhi strains ( Holt et al. , 2008 ) clearly shows that the z66 strains ( 404ty and E034983 , haplotype 59 ) did not arise early . 
However the presence of 42 SNPs on the internal node leading to the two strains affords considerable time frame for the emergence of the z66 phenotype ( Fig. 4 ) . 
In a recent study , Baker et al. ( 2008 ) analysed 140 Typhi isolates from Indonesia using SNPs discovered by Roumagnac et al. ( 2006 ) , and identiﬁed nine haplotypes ( SNP proﬁles ) circulating in Indonesia , of which the predominant haplotype , H59 , carries the z66 antigen . 
Again not all H59 isolates carry the antigen , indicating that z66 is not stably maintained in nature . 
It is possible that the co-existence of monophasic and diphasic Typhi isolates in Indonesia is a result of balancing selection to maintain the genetic diversity of the ﬂagellar antigen ( Selander et al. , 1996 ) . 
6. Concluding remarks
In this review we discussed the population structure of Salmonella , which is divided into two species , S. enterica and S. bongori . 
The former clearly has a subspecies structure delineated consistently by sequence variation with 2.8 -- 4.4 % nucleotide difference between subspecies . 
The frequency of recombination between subspecies is very low , but within subspecies I at least is high , and this may well apply to all subspecies and S. bongori . 
However , few of the more than 2400 known serovars have been studied by MLST and the sharp demarcation currently observed may not be so clear when the S. enterica diversity is fully canvassed . 
Typhimurium has developed considerable diversity with 12 STs known , of which 9 are in the ST19 clonal complex that includes the majority of the Typhimurium isolates . 
This clonal complex diversiﬁed through both mutation and recombination , and is old in comparison to Typhi , based on the number of mutations accumulated . 
The limited data on Typhimurium phage types show that some do not have a single origin , but this is only a preview of what is to come when genome wide SNPs are used to study the ST19 clonal complex and the more than 200 phage types . 
It seems clear that for both serovars and phage types , the relevant combination of surface antigens or phage sensitivity patterns , respectively , can arise more than once , serotyping and phage typing have been extremely useful in analysis of diversity and population structures , but it needs to be considered that neither serovars nor phage types necessarily represent a single clonal origin of the isolates involved . 
Deﬁning relationships robustly using SNPs will help selection of appropriate strains for comparative genomic studies to reveal the key changes that lead to the emergence or dominance of speciﬁc clones or phage types . 
This is illustrated by phage type DT104 within which the multidrug-resistant variant arose . 
DT104 is represented by six STs and clearly heterogeneous , but the MDR variant presumably only evolved once ( Matiasovicova et al. , 2007 ) and spread across many parts of the world . 
There is a need to ﬁnd its closest relative to determine the details of that event and the other evolutionary processes involved . 
SNPs have been shown to be very useful for typing and resolving relationships of Typhi isolates ( Roumagnac et al. , 2006 ; Octavia and Lan , 2007 ; Holt et al. , 2008 ) . 
SNP typing based global epidemiological surveillance will provide much better data on spread of Typhi , for example the nalidixic acid resistant haplotype H58 ( Roumagnac et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , the number of SNPs which needs to be typed demands economical and fast technologies , especially as Typhi is predominantly a problem in developing countries where implementation of current large scale SNP typing technologies for surveillance is impractical . 
The Typhi studies show spectacularly the power of SNPs for studying the evolution of a homogenous clone . 
Genome sequences of 19 isolates revealed more than 1700 SNPs in total , giving a fully resolved phylogenetic tree which allows one to trace the genetic changes that occurred during clonal diversiﬁcation . 
The Typhi studies also highlight the need for comprehensive representation of the diversity of a clone when selecting isolates and sufﬁcient number of genes for SNP discovery to minimize phylogenetic discovery bias . 
This remains a major challenge for studying other Salmonella clones .
