In the past , we showed differences in heterophil function between parental broilers ( A [ fast feathering ] / B [ slow feathering ] ) and their F1 reciprocal crosses ( D [ fast feathering ] / C [ slow feathering ] ) . 
In the present study , we evaluated the linkage of the feathering gene to heterophil function , pro-inflammatory cytokine / chemokine mRNA expression levels , and resistance to Salmonella enteritidis organ invasion . 
Heterophils were isolated from 2-day-old chickens ( C and D ) separated into males and females * slow males and females ( SM and SF ) , and fast males and females ( FM and FF ) .

Introduction
The poultry industry suffers major economic losses from both mortality due to infectious diseases and potential contamination of food products due to transfer of microorganisms . 
Our laboratories have been evaluating the innate immune system of pedigree broilers in order to assess their capacity to protect against pathogen invasion , including Salmonella enteritidis . 
We have extensively characterized the innate immune response of two parental broiler lines * A ( fast feathering ) and B ( slow feathering ) . 
To date , we have shown that an increased in vitro heterophil function ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003a , b ) corresponds with an increased in vivo resistance to organ invasion by Gram-positive ( Swaggerty et al. , 2005b ) and Gram-negative bacterial infections ( Ferro et al. , 2004 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2005a ) . 
In addition , we have shown increased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in heterophils isolated from the more resistant lines compared with the susceptible lines ( Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) . 
Straight-run , not separated by sex , F1 reciprocal crosses ( C / B sire / A dam ; D / A sire / B dam ) have a differential heterophil response ( D [ fast feathering ] / C [ slow feathering ] ) ( Swaggerty et al . 
, 
2003b ) and cytokine profile ( Ferro et al. , 2004 ) . 
Collectively , our data indicate there are clear and measurable differences in heterophil function and innate response that are under specific genetic control . 
The feathering gene is located on the short arm of the Z sex chromosome and codes for feather growth . 
The fast feather allele , k , is the wild-type recessive trait responsible for rapid feather growth , whereas the slow feather allele , K , is dominant and responsible for slow feather growth . 
Our previous results suggest the presence of the fast feathering gene ( k ) may enhance heterophil functional efficiency while the slow feathering gene ( K ) may reduce the functional efficiency of isolated heterophils . 
Based on in vitro heterophil functional differences , we decided to evaluate chickens from the F1 reciprocal crosses separated by sex to determine whether in vitro heterophil function is linked to or merely associated with the feathering gene . 
The objective of this study was to determine whether there was linkage between the feathering gene and the in vitro heterophil functions of degranulation and oxidative burst , cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression levels in heterophils , or in vivo organ invasion by S. enteritidis . 
With respect to the feathering gene , the F1 reciprocal cross males are the same in both lines ( slow males [ SM ] and fast males [ FM ] / K/k ) whereas the females are different ( slow females [ SF ] / K / ; fas females [ FF ] / k / ) . 
Therefore , if in vitro heterophil functional efficiency was associated with the fast feathering gene , we would expect heterophils from FF to be functionally more efficient than heterophils from SF , while the functional efficiency of heterophils from SM and FM would be the same .

Materials and Methods
Chickens . 
F1 reciprocal cross chickens ( F1 cross C / B sire / A dam ; F1 cross D / A sire / B dam ) were hatched at a commercial hatchery and separated into males and females . 
F1 cross D chickens were feather sexed , while F1 cross C chickens were vent sexed . 
The male and female progeny from slow feathering cross C were referred to as slow male ( SM ) and slow female ( SF ) , while the fast feathering cross D males and females were FM and FF , respectively . 
With respect to the feathering gene , the F1 reciprocal cross males are the same in both lines ( SM and

FM / K/k / ) whereas the females are different ( SF / K / ; FF / k / / ) . 
Chickens were transported to our facility on the day of hatch in standard chick boxes containing hydration gel packs in an enclosed , temperature-controlled vehicle . 
Upon arrival chickens were placed in 
2m / 2m floor pens containing wood shavings , provided supplemental heat , water , and un-medicated corn and soybean meal-based chick starter diet ad libitum . 
The feed met or exceeded standards established by the National Research Council ( 1994 ) .

Heterophils ( 1 10 7 
Bacteria . 
A poultry isolate of S. enteritidis ( # 97-11771 ) was obtained from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory ( Ames , Iowa , USA ) and approved by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) . 
S. enteritidis was cultured in tryptic soy broth ( Difco Laboratories , Becton Dickinson Co. , Sparks , Maryland , USA ) overnight at 418C . 
Stock S. enteritidis ( 1 / 10 colony forming units [ CFU ] / ml ) were 9 prepared as previously described ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003b ) . 
S. enteritidis was prepared in RPMI or phosphate-buffered saline for in vitro and in vivo assays , respectively . 
S. enteritidis were opsonized with normal chicken serum ( NCS-OpSE ) as previously described ( Kogut et al. , 
2001).
Heterophil isolation . 
Heterophils were isolated from peripheral blood of 150 chickens per group , 2 days post-hatch . 
Blood was collected in vacutainer tubes containing disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( BD vacutainer , Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , USA ) and mixed thoroughly . 
Following blood collection , heterophils were isolated as previously described ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003b ) . 
Heterophil preparations were consistently 95 % pure and / 95 % viable . 
All tissue culture reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company ( St Louis ,

Fold change is calculated using the fo 2 . 
( S. enteritidis corrected mean control corrected mean )

Phagocytosis . 
Heterophils were assayed for the ability to phagocytize live S. enteritidis as previously described ( Kogut et al. , 2001 ) . 
Briefly , heterophils ( 2 ml of 5 10 cells/ml ) and S. enteritidis ( 2 ml of 5 6 / / 10 CFU/ml ) were added to diluted heterophils ( 10 S. enteritidis :1 7 heterophil ) and centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min . 
The pelleted / heterophils and S. enteritidis were incubated 1 h at 398C and then submerged in ice for 15 min . 
The samples were washed with equal volume of ice-cold RPMI and centrifuged at 2000 / g for 15 min . 
The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold gentamicin ( 100 mg/ml in RPMI ) and incubated for 1 h at 378C on a rotary shaker . 
Heterophils were washed three times with ice-cold RPMI ( 3 to 5 ml per wash and centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min ) , and the pellet was re-suspended in 2 / ml RPMI . 
Cytospin smears were prepared from each sample in a Shandon Cytospin 3 ( Shandon Inc. , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA ) , stained with Hematology 3-step stain ( Biochemical Sciences , Inc. , Swedesboro , New Jersey , USA ) , and examined by light microscopy 
Degranulation . 
The release of intracellular granules was monitored by quantifying the amount ( mM ) of b-d-glucuronidase in the supernatant of heterophils as previously described ( Kogut et al. , 2001 ) . 
Heterophils ( 8 / 10 cells/ml ) were treated with OpSE or RPMI for 1 h at 39 6 8C on a rotary shaker . 
The samples were immersed in ice for 10 min . 
Cells were removed by centrifugation ( 250 / g for 15 min at 48C ) , the supernatants collected then assayed for b-d-glucuronidase activity . 
Briefly , samples and standards ( 25 ml ) were added to a black flat-bottom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate and incubated with 50 ml freshly prepared substrate ( 10 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-b-d-glucuronide dissolved in 
0.1 M sodium acetate buffer containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 ; pH 4.0 ) for 4 h at 418C . 
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 ml stop solution ( 0.05 M glycine , 5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ; pH 10.4 ) . 
Released 4-methylumbelliferone was measured on a GENios Plus 
Fluorescence Microplate Reader ( TECAN US Inc , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA ) ( excitation / 355 nm , emission / 460 nm ) 
Oxidative burst . 
Production of reactive oxygen species by heterophils during oxidative burst was measured by oxidation of DCFH-DA to fluorescent DCF as previously described ( He et al. , 2003 ) . 
Briefly , heterophils ( 1 ml , 8 / 10 cells/ml ) were incubated with 5 % chicken 6 serum , DCFH-DA ( 10 mg/ml ) , and phorbol A-myristate 13-acetate ( 1 mg/ml ) for 1 h at 378C and 5 % CO2 . 
Heterophils ( 150 ml ) were then dispensed to a black 96-well plate and the fluorescence intensity measured using a GENios Plus Fluorescence Microplate Reader at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths ( manually set gain at 50 ) . 
The mean relative fluorescent units ( RFU ) were recorded 
/ ) were treated with 300 ml RPMI or S. enteritidis , for 30 min at 398C on a rotary shaker . 
Treated heterophils were pelleted , washed with RPMI ( 485 / g for 15 min at 48C ) , the supernatant discarded , the cells re-suspended in lysis buffer ( Qiagen 
RNeasy mini RNA extraction kit ; Qiagen Inc. , Valencia , California , USA ) , and frozen . 
Total RNA was extracted from homogeni-zed ( QIAshredder columns ) lysates according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . 
Cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression levels in control and agonisttreated heterophils were quantitated using a method described by Kaiser and colleagues ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ) . 
Primers and probes have been described previously ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ; Kogut et al. , 2003 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) . 
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was performed using the Reverse Transcriptase qPCR Master Mix RT-PCR kit ( Eurogentec , San Diego , California , USA ) . 
Amplification and detection of products were performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System ( PE 
Applied Biosystems , Warrington , UK ) . 
All samples were standardized using 28S RNA .

Organ invasion . 
Thirty 2-day-old chickens from each group were 6 7 challenged orally with 5 / 10 CFU S. enteritidis ( 0.5 ml , 1 / 10 
CFU/ml stock ) . 
Twenty-four hours post-challenge , chickens were euthanized and necropsied . 
At necropsy , livers and spleens were aseptically removed and incubated overnight at 418C in tetrathionate enrichment broth . 
Following enrichment , 10 ml were streaked onto brilliant green agar plates with carbenicillin and novobiocin , incubated 24 h at 418C , then the plates examined for non-lactose fermenting carbenicillin and novobiocin-resistant Salmonella colonies . 
Representative colonies were confirmed S. enteritidis - positive by plate agglutination using specific Group D1 antisera ( Difco Laboratories ) . 
Nonchallenged chickens from each group were included as negative controls . 
Three experimental trials were conducted and the data pooled for presentation and statistical analysis . 
Statistical analyses . 
Anti-coagulated blood from 150 chickens per group was pooled and heterophils isolated for the in vitro assays . 
Each bloo collection and heterophil isolation was conducted on three separate days ; therefore , heterophils were pooled from a total of 450 chickens .

Phagocytosis . 
Heterophils isolated from FF , FM , SF , and SM chickens were evaluated for the ability to phagocytize S. enteritidis . 
Specifically the percentage of heterophils with S. enteritidis and the average number of S. enteritidis per heterophil was determined . 
There were no differences between any of the groups with regard to percentage of heterophils that engulfed S. enteritidis , nor in the number of S. enteritidis per heterophil . 
The percentage of heterophils from males and females that engulfed S. enteritidis was all between 78.7 and 80.7 % , and all groups phagocytized seven to nine S. enteritidis per heterophil ( data not shown ) .

Degranulation . 
The ability of heterophils to release bactericidal granules ( degranulation ) following stimulation was also measured in heterophils isolated from FF , FM , SF , and SM chickens ( Figure 1 ) . 
Heterophils isolated from FF chickens released a significantly ( PB/0 .05 ) higher concentration ( mM ) of b-d-glucuroni-dase , the enzyme associated with heterophil-mediated degranulation , than heterophils from SF chickens ( 1839 / 8.9 and 1499/3 .7 mM , respectively ) . 
Comparisons between heterophils from FM and SM showed no differences in degranulation ( 1569/5 .1 and 1469/2 .2 mM , respectively ) . 
Oxidative burst . 
Oxidative burst was measured in heterophils from FF , SF , FM , and SM chickens following stimulation with phorbol A-myristate 13-acetate ( Figure 2 ) . 
As seen with degranulation , heterophils from FF chickens underwent a significantly greater ( PB/0 .05 ) oxidative burst response compared with three separate experiments ( n / 450 chickens ) .

Additionally , there were no differences in the oxidative burst response between heterophils isolated from the males ( FM / 4.1 / 10 RFU ; SM / 4 4 4.0 / 10 RFU ) .

Cytokine mRNA expression . 
We also evaluated hetero-phils for mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflamma-tory cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -6 , the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCLi2 ( formerly IL-8 ) , and interferon ( IFN ) - a ( Table 1 ) . 
There were no differences in the control or S. enteritidis-stimulated mRNA expression levels of IL-6 , CXCLi2 , or IFN-a between heterophils from the FF and SF chickens , therefore indicating there was no linkage with the feathering gene . 
Likewise , no differences were observed for IL-6 and CXCLi2 for FM and SM heterophils ( control or S. enteritidisstimulated ) . 
There was a statistical ( PB/0 .05 ) difference in the IFN-a mRNA expression levels observed between the control males ( FM / SM ) and a change in mRNA expression levels following S. enteritidis - stimulation ( SM / FM ) . 
Degranulation 
Organ invasion . 
In addition to the in vitro heterophil functional studies , an in vivo S. enteritidis challenge was conducted to determine whether there were differences in extraintestinal organ invasion between the FF and SF chickens and the FM and SM chickens ( Figure 3 ) . 
The FF chickens had numerically ( P / 0.09 ) fewer positive chickens compared with the S. enteritidis - infected SF ( 36.7 % and 49.4 % , respectively ) . 
However , there was a statistical ( PB / 0.05 ) difference between the males . 
There were 15.6 % S. enteritidis - positive FM chickens , while 34.4 % from the SM were positive for S. enteritidis organ invasion . 
All control chickens were negative for S. enteritidis . 
There was no linkage between the feathering gene and protection against S. enteritidis organ invasion ( liver and spleen ) .

Discussion
Previous studies by our laboratory examined in vitro heterophil function and resistance/susceptibility to bacterial challenge with S. enteritidis and Enterococcus gallinarum in parental broilers ( Line A [ fast feathering ] and Line B [ slow feathering ] ) and their F1 reciprocal crosses ( C and D ) ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003b , 2005b ; Ferro et al. , 2004 ) . 
With respect to the feathering gene , the F1 reciprocal cross males are the same in both lines ( SM and FM / K/k / ) whereas the females are different ( SF / K / ; FF / k / / ) . 
The initial studies by our group , as well as all subsequent evaluations , have shown a dichotomy of innate immune responsiveness between fast and slow feathering lines at the parent level and F1 generations . 
In all immunologic evaluations of the lines of these chickens , fast-feathering chickens have a more effective heterophil-mediated innate immune response with increased resistance to bacterial challenges compared with their slow-feathering counterparts ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003a , b , 2004 , 2005a , b , 2006 ; Ferro et al. , 2004 ) . 
The objective of the present study was to determine whether the feathering gene was actually linked to , not just associated with , increased in vitro heterophil function , the cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression levels produced by heterophils , or increased resistance to in vivo liver/spleen organ invasion by S. enteritidis . 
To our knowledge and with the exception of our initial report ( Swaggerty et al. , 2003a ) , there are no studies evaluating the role of the feathering gene in either innate immune responsiveness or heterophil function in chickexperiments . 
Data shown are the percentages obtained from the number of S. enteritidis-positive chickens/90 . 
All comparisons are between females ( FF vs SF ) or between males ( FM vs SM ) ( * PB/0 .05 ) . 
ens. Therefore , our results showing that the bactericidal killing mechanisms of degranulation and oxidative burst were linked to the recessive k fast feathering gene were the first report to show direct linkage between the feathering gene and innate immunity in broilers . 
These data do not indicate that the feathering gene is the sole gene responsible for degranulation and oxidative burst as heterophils from both fast and slow feathering chickens have a response . 
Slow feathering in poultry is a result of a qualitative Z-sex-linked dominant gene ( K ) , while fast feathering is actually the wild-type trait associated with the recessive allele ( k ) ( Moreng and Avens , 1985 ; Austic and Nesheim , 1990 ) . 
Slow feathering is a mutation resulting from the insertion of endogenous retroviral DNA ( ev21 ) into the genome , which then becomes inherited like any other host gene ( Bacon et al. , 1988 ; Iraqi & Smith , 1995 ) . 
In addition to the feathering alleles K and k mentioned in the present study , there are two other feathering alleles , K and K , which are associated n s with varying degrees of feathering ( Somes , Jr. , 1969 ; Chambers et al. , 1994 ) . 
Ultimately , K is the dominant n feathering allele and the most severe , but none of the chickens utilized in the present study fall into this genotype . 
Therefore , for the chickens we evaluated in this study , the slow-feathering K allele was dominant . 
There are numerous reports relating the feathering gene to nutrition and growth ( Ajang et al. , 1993 ; Fotsa et al. , 2001 ; Hamoen et al. , 2001 ; Kalinowski et al. , 2003 ; Sikur et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , most of the studies involving the immune function of fast-feathering and slow-feathering chickens are directed towards viral immunity or antibody production ( Bacon et al. , 1986 ; Smith & Fadly , 1988 ; Fadly & Smith , 1997 ; Smith & Crittenden , 1998 ) . 
Slow-feathering progeny from a slow-feathering dam displayed an `` inadequate immune response '' based on increased viral infections and decreased antibody production indicating a poor acquired immune response ( Harris et al. , 1984 ) . 
The equivalent slow-feathering progeny from slow-feathering dams in the present study were the SM and SF . 
Similarly , we observed a decreased immune function as demonstrated by a decreased bactericidal killing and increased suscept-ibility to S. enteritidis organ invasion . 
As we now know the acquired immune response is controlled by the innate immune response , therefore , a poor acquired response would be directly related to an initial poor innate response ( Bendelac et al. , 1997 ; Janeway , Jr. & Medzhitov , 2002 ; Pasare & Medzhitov , 2005 ) .

These actions are very complex and are under the control of numerous genes and gene families and redundant pathways ( Underhill and Ozinsky , 2002 ; Jutras and Desjardins , 2005 ; Stuart and Ezekowitz , 2005 ) . 
In fact , IL-6 and CXCLi2 are encoded on chromosomes 2 and 4 , respectively ( Kaiser et al. , 2005 ) ; therefore , it is logical that there is no linkage between the feathering gene that is on the Z chromosome . 
Even though IFN-a is encoded on the Z sex chromosome , the data indicate its mRNA expression levels are not linked to the feathering gene , also present on the same chromosome . 
The results presented herein showed S. enteritidis liver/spleen organ invasion in young chickens was not under control of the feathering gene . 
Numerous studies indicate S. enteritidis organ invasion is controlled by multiple genes ( Bumstead & Barrow , 1988 ; Mariani et al. , 2001 ; Lamont et al. , 2002 ; Wigley et al. , 2002 ; Wigley 2004 ; Beal et al. , 2005 ) . 
Lamont and colleagues show there are at least four genes associated with S. enteritidis colonization of the spleen in 1-day-old chickens ; however , the role of the feathering gene is not addressed in that study ( Lamont et al. , 2002 ) . 
Even though the feathering gene was not linked to S. enteritidis organ invasion in young broilers , our previous studies indicate there is an association between fast feathering and increased resistance to bacterial infections ( Ferro et al. , 2004 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2005a , b ) . 
Additional studies are required to further characterize the innate immune responsiveness of the parent lines ( A and B ) and the F1 reciprocal crosses ( C and D ) including the role of the sire in conferring resistance/susceptibility to S. enteritidis organ invasion .
