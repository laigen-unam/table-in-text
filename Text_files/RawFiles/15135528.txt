Abstract 
Z66 antigen-positive strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi change ﬂagellin expression in only one direction from the z66 antigen to the d or j antigen , which is different from the phase variation of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
In the present study , we identiﬁed a new ﬂagellin gene in z66 antigen-positive strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
The genomic structure of the region containing this new ﬂagellin gene was similar to that of ﬂjBA operon of biphasic S. enterica serovars . 
A ﬂjA-like gene was present downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
A rho-independent terminator was located between the new ﬂagellin gene and the ﬂjA-like gene . 
Hin-like gene was not present upstream of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
We generated a mutant strain of S. enterica serovar Typhi , which carries a deletion of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
Western blotting revealed that the 51-kDa z66 antigen protein was absent from the population of proteins secreted by the mutant strain . 
Southern hybridization demonstrated that the z66 antigen-positive strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi carried the new ﬂagellin gene and ﬂiC on two different genomic EcoRI fragments . 
When z66 antigen-positive strains were incubated with anti-z66 antiserum , the ﬂagellin expression by S. enterica serovar Typhi changed from z66 antigen to j 
antigen . 
The new ﬂagellin gene and the ﬂjA-like gene were absent in the strain with altered ﬂagellin expression . 
These results suggested that the new ﬂagellin gene is a ﬂjB-like gene , which encodes the z66 antigen of S. enterica serovar Typhi , and that deletion of ﬂjBA-like operon may explain why S. enterica serovar Typhi alters the ﬂagellin expression in only one direction from the z66 antigen to the d or j antigen .

1. Introduction
Flagella are essential for the motility and pathoge-nicity of Salmonella [ 1 -- 3 ] . 
The monomer of ﬂagellin protein can be divided into four structural domains : D0 , D1 , D2 , and D3 . 
Domains D0 and D1 form the central tube of the ﬁlament and are highly conserved .

D3 consists of the approximately 100 amino acid resi-dues in the central hypervariable region of the protein and is exposed on the ﬁlament surface [ 4 ] . 
The antigenic epitope of ﬂagella is located mainly in the central hypervariable region [ 4 -- 6 ] . 
Approximately 100 serotypes of ﬂagellin have been identiﬁed in Salmonella under the nomenclature of a through z1 -- zn [ 7,8 ] . 
Most S. enterica serovars show biphasic variation in expression of two different ﬂagellins , phase-1 and phase-2 ﬂagellin encoded by ﬂiC and ﬂjB respectively , which are located in different chromosomal loci [ 7,8 ] . 
In phase-2 ﬂagellin operon of biphasic S. enterica serovars , the ﬂjA gene is located downstream of ﬂjB after a rho-in-dependent terminator sequence . 
FljA encoded by the ﬂjA gene is a repressor of ﬂiC and is important for ﬂa-gellin phase variation in Salmonella [ 2,9 -- 11 ] . 
In contrast , S. enterica serovar Typhi is considered mono-phasic and carries only the phase-1 ﬂagellin gene , ﬂiC that encodes the d antigen [ 12,13 ] . 
J antigen has been identiﬁed as the phase-1 ﬂagellin of S. enterica serovar Typhi , which is encoded by a ﬂiC gene that lacks 261 bp in the central variable region of the ﬂiC encoding the d antigen [ 13 ] . 
In 1981 Guinee et al. identiﬁed a previously unknown an-tigen , z66 , in an S. enterica serovar Typhi isolated in Indonesia [ 14 ] . 
Z66 antigen positive strains showed ﬂa-gellin expression changing in only one direction , from z66 to the d or j antigen [ 14,15 ] . 
The z66 antigen was hypothesized to be a phase-2 ﬂagellin , but this could not be conﬁrmed because the gene encoding z66 antigen had not yet been cloned [ 15,16 ] . 
In the present study , we used PCR and sequence analysis to identify a new ﬂagellin gene in a z66 antigenpositive strain of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
We then examined whether this new ﬂagellin gene encoded the z66 antigen . 
A change in ﬂagellin expression by Salmo-nella enterica serovar Typhi was induced by incubation with anti-z66 antiserum , and the new ﬂagellin gene identiﬁed in the present study was investigated in strains with altered ﬂagellin expression .

Ampliﬁcation of the ﬂagellin gene and sequencing of the PCR products 
The Salmonella ﬂagellin gene , ﬂiC was ampliﬁed with primers PdB-A and PdB-B on PCR System 2700 ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.0 % agarose gels and visualized by UV transillumination . 
PCR products were puriﬁed with Micro-spinTM S-400 HR columns ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . 
When multiple fragments were present in a PCR product , fragments were harvested with Reco-Chip ( TaKaRa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Puriﬁed PCR products were cloned into pGEM - T Easy vector ( Promega ) and maintained in E. coli DH5a . 
Sequencing of DNA fragments was performed with an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) with the T7 and SP6 primers or gene-speciﬁc primers . 
The sequences of primers used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 
2.3 . 
Sequencing upstream and downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene on the chromosome 
Upstream and downstream regions were sequenced with the LA PCRTM in vitro Cloning Kit ( TaKaRa ) . 
Brieﬂy , genomic DNA of S. enterica serovar Typhi was digested with an appropriate restriction endonuclease and ligated to a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette . 
The upstream and downstream regions were then ampliﬁed by nested PCR with cassette - and fragment-speciﬁc primers . 
The procedure was repeated with a different restriction endonuclease and with cassette - and fragment-speciﬁc primers . 
Nested reverse primers , PU1-B1 and PU1-B2 , and nested forward primers , PL-A1 and PL-A2 , were designed from the sequenced fragment . 
Genomic DNA of S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU10007 was digested with HindIII and PstI and ligated to the corresponding cassettes . 
The cassettes-speciﬁc nested primers C1 and C2 wer used for PCR with primer pairs PU1-B1 and PU1-B2 and PL-A1 and PL-A2 to investigate upstream and downstream of the HindIII - and PstI-genomic DNA fragments . 
Nested PCR was performed as the protocol of the kit . 
Nested PCR products were puriﬁed and sequenced again . 
To examine the region upstream of the fragment , a second nested PCR was performed with the forward cassettes-speciﬁc primers C1 and C2 and the nested reverse primers PU2-B1 and PU2-B2 , which were designed from the upstream sequence determined from the ﬁrst nested PCR and sequence analysis of the EcoRI-digested genomic DNA .

Generation of the new ﬂagellin deletion mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB from S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU10007 
To generate a mutant strain carrying a deletion of the new ﬂagellin gene , primer pairs F1A/F1B and F2A / F2B were used to amplify fragments F1 ( bp60-892 ) and F2 ( bp2021-3156 ) located upstream and downstream , respectively , of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
A BamHI-spe-0 ciﬁc oligonucleotide was added to the 5 - termini of primers F1A and F2B . 
A BglII-speciﬁc oligonucleotide 0 was added to the 5 - termini of primers F1B and F2A . 
Two fragments F1 and F2 were ampliﬁed from S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU10007 and digested with BglII and ligated with DNA Ligation Kit Ver .2 ( TaKaRa ) . 
This ligated product that lacks 1124 bp of the new ﬂagellin gene was cloned into the BamHI site of the pGMB151 suicide plasmid and transferred into S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU10007 by electroporation as described previously [ 18 ] . 
The mutant strain was selected by PCR with primers F1A and F2B , veriﬁed by sequencing analysis , and designated as GIFU10007-DﬂjB . 
2.5 . 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of secreted proteins 
The wild strain GIFU10007 and the mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB were incubated in 10 ml of Luria -- Bertani broth containing 300 mM NaCl at 37 C over-night . 
Secreted proteins were extracted and dissolved in 20 ll loading buffer [ 18 ] . 
After denaturation at 100 C for 3 min , the secreted proteins were separated by SDS -- PAGE on 15 % polyacrylamide gels [ 19 ] , and visualized by silver staining ( Silver Staining Kit , TaKaRa ) . 
The separated secreted proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blotting with rabbit anti-z66 antiserum ( National Institute of Infectious Disease , Japan ) as the primary antibody and anti-rabbit Ig antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase ( anti-rabbit Ig-Fc , AP Conjugate , Pro-mega ) as described previously [ 18 ] . 
2.6. Southern hybridization
Primers PZ66-A and PZ66-B were used to amplify a 375 bp fragment from the central region of the new ﬂagellin gene of the strain GIFU 10007 . 
Primers PdB-A and PdB-B were designed from the conserved regions of ﬂiC of S. enterica serovar Typhi Ty2 ( NC 004631 ) to amplify a 1300 bp fragment of ﬂiC . 
Primers PdS-A and PdS-B were designed from the speciﬁc central region of ﬂiC of Ty2 to amplify a 340 bp fragment of ﬂiC . 
PCR products of ﬂiC ampliﬁed from the strain Ty2 were puriﬁed over the Micro-spinTM S-400 HR columns ( Amersham Pharmacia ) and labeled with alkaline phosphatase ( Alkphos Kit , Amersham Pharmacia ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Bacterial genomic DNA ( 3 lg ) was digested with EcoRI , separated on 1.0 % agarose gels , and transferred to Hybond-N + membrane ( Amersham Pharmacia ) with 20 SSC according to the method in Molecular Cloning [ 19 ] . 
DNA was ﬁxed to the membrane at 80 C for 2 h. Hybridization was performed as the manufacturer 's instructions in the Alkphos kit ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . 
The chemiluminescence signal was generated by adding the CDP-Star Detection Reagent ( Amersham Pharmacia ) on the membrane and photographed with a Fluor-STM MultImager ( BIO-RAD ) . 
2.7 . 
Changes in ﬂagellin expression by S. enterica serovar Typhi induced by anti-z66 antiserum 
Tubes containing semisolid LB medium were prepared . 
The LB medium was premixed with anti-z66 rabbit serum at a 1:500 dilution and separated into central and surrounding domains with a small central tube . 
The wild strain GIFU10007 was inoculated into the bottom of the semisolid LB medium tube through the small central tube . 
Cultures were incubated 24 -- 48 h at 37 C . 
After incubation , if there were bacteria moving up from the surrounding domain outside the small central tube , the bacteria were transferred and incubated on LB plates at 37 C overnight . 
Bacterial antigens were then screened with anti-d , - j , and - z66 antisera . 
The z66 antigen-negative and the d or j antigen-positive strains were identiﬁed as strains where ﬂagellin expression was altered . 
3. Results and discussion
3.1 . 
A new ﬂagellin gene in a z66 antigen-positive strain of S. enterica serovar TyphiGIFU10007 
Previous attempts to clone the gene encoding the z66 antigen with primers designed from the ﬂjB genes of biphasic S. enterica serovars were unsuccessful [ 15,16 ] . 
In the present study , primers PdS-A and PdS-B were designed in conserved regions ( bp1 -- 20 an bp1299 -- 1318 ) of ﬂiC of the type strain Ty2 . 
Two fragments , approximately 1.25 and 1.05 kb were ampliﬁed from the wild strain GIFU10007 , a z66 antigen-positive strain , and the Vi-defective mutant strain of GIFU10007 . 
We obtained similar results with strains cultured for several generations on LB agar plates . 
We cloned and sequenced both fragments . 
The smaller fragment , which was 1056 bp in length , was identical to the ﬂiC gene that encodes the j antigen . 
The larger fragment , which was 1263 bp in length , was different from the ﬂiC gene encoding the j or d antigen of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
Homology searches of DDBJ ( http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) revealed that the ﬁrst 500 bp and last 200 bp of the fragment were highly similar to the conserved terminal regions of ﬂagellin genes of Salmonella and E. coli , however , the central portion of the fragment was unique . 
These results suggested that the 1263 bp fragment is likely a new ﬂagellin gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
3.2 . 
The new ﬂagellin gene is the ﬂjB-like gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi 
The wild strain GIFU10007 carries two types of ﬂa-gellin genes , ﬂiC and a new ﬂagellin gene . 
To determine whether the new ﬂagellin gene was the phase-2 ﬂagellin gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi , we examined sequences upstream and downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
Sequencing upstream and downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene on the chromosome yielded 3325 bp sequence of the strain GIFU10007 . 
This sequence has been deposited in DDBJ under accession number AB108532 . 
Three directional open reading frames ( ORFs ) were present in the 3325 bp sequence : a 1467 bp ORF containing the new ﬂagellin gene ; a 525 bp ORF located 84 bp downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene ; a 261 bp ORF located 276 bp upstream of the new ﬂagellin gene . 
After similarity searches in DDBJ , we found that the genomic organization of the 3325 bp segment of the strain GIFU10007 was similar to that of the phase-2 ﬂagellin operon of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In phase-2 ﬂagellin operons of biphasic S enterica serovars , ﬂjA is located 70 bp downstream of ﬂjB ; upstream of ﬂjA is a rho-independent terminator ( RIT ) of ﬂjB , which is thought to regulate expression of ﬂjA [ 2,10 ] . 
The 525-bp ORF from the strain GIFU10007 was similar to ﬂjA of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 with 70.3 % homology at the amino acid level . 
Also , a RIT was identiﬁed downstream of the 1467 bp new ﬂagellin gene and upstream of the 525 bp ORF . 
On the basis of these characteristics of genomic organization , we presumed that the 1467 bp new ﬂagellin gene is the ﬂjB-like gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
The hin gene ( 573 bp ) , which encodes a site-speciﬁc recombinase , is located 147 bp upstream of ﬂjB in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 . 
Hin is ﬂanked by a 14-bp inverted repeat ( hix ) with part of the ﬂjBA promoter sequence and mediates ﬂagellin phase variation [ 20 -- 22 ] . 
A 261-bp ORF was found in the 840-bp of available upstream sequence of the ﬂjB-like gene of the strain GIFU10007 , but it was quite different from hin of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
No similar sequence was found in DDBJ . 
The intervening sequence between the 261-bp ORF and the ﬂjB-like gene of GIFU10007 strain was quite different from the corresponding region of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 . 
There was no phase-2 ﬂagellin operon found among published genomic sequences of S. enterica serovar Typhi Ty2 and CT18 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/ Complete.html ) or in genomic researches of S. enterica serovar Typhi [ 23 ] . 
Thus , this work is the initial identiﬁcation of the phase-2 ﬂagellin-like operon in S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
3.3 . 
The new ﬂagellin gene encodes the z66 antigen of S. enterica serovar TyphiGIFU10007 
To study the protein encoded by the new ﬂagellin gene , we generated a mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB , which carries a deletion of the new ﬂagellin gene from the wild strain GIFU10007 . 
The mutant strain was identiﬁed by the PCR ( Fig. 2 ( a ) ) and conﬁrmed by subsequent sequence analysis . 
The Salmonella ﬂagellin gene is usually expressed at high osmolarity and can be detected in the secreted proteins of bacteria [ 17,18 ] . 
To investigate the ﬂagellin proteins , the wild strain GIFU10007 and the mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB were incubated in LB broth containing 300 mM NaCl . 
Secreted proteins were separated by SDS -- PAGE on 15 % polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining . 
A 51 kDa protein was absent from the population of proteins secreted by the mutant ( Fig. 2 ( b ) ) . 
The molecular size of the protein was the same as that predicted from the amino acid sequence of the new ﬂagellin gene ( 50.97 kDa ) . 
Western blotting with rabbit anti-z66 antiserum showed that the 51 kDa z66 antigen protein was absent from the secreted proteins of the mutant ( see Fig. 2 ( c ) ) . 
These results indi-separated on 15 % polyacrylamide gels followed by silver staining . 
A 51-kDa protein was absent in the strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB ( ﬂjB ) ) . 
( c ) Western analysis of the secreted proteins with anti-z66 antiserum . 
A 51-kDa protein , which is thought to be z66 antigen , is absent in the mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB ( ﬂjB ) ) .

Genomic organization of a 3325 bp fragment of the S. enterica serovar Typhi genome and the phase-2 ﬂagellin operon of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
The 3325 bp fragment of S. enterica serovar Typhi GITU10007 contains a 1467 bp ORF that is similar to ﬂjB of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ( 59.0 % deduced amino acid similarity ) and a 525 bp ORF that is similar to ﬂjA of the strain LT2 ( 70.3 % deduced amino acid similarity ) . 
A rho-independent terminator ( RIT ) is located between the 1467 bp and the 525 bp ORFs and is similar to that of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
The 261 bp ORF upstream of the 1467 bp ORF is different from the hin gene of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , which is located in similar position . 
3.4 . 
Investigation of the ﬂjB-like gene and ﬂiC in the z66 antigen-positive and antigen-negative strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi 
To investigate the ﬂjB-like gene in strains of S. ent-erica serovar Typhi , we used PCR with primers PZ66-A / PZ66-B to amplify a 375 bp product from the central region of the ﬂjB-like gene ( bp542 -- 916 ) . 
As illustrated by the PCR results in Fig. 3 ( a ) , the expected fragment was ampliﬁed from GIFU10007 strain and ﬁve other z66-positive strains ( S2 and S4 -- S8 ) , but not from the type strain Ty2 and z66-negative strains ( S1 and S3 ) . 
The similar results were obtained with the primers F1A / F1B , which located upstream of the ﬂjB-like gene ( Fig. 3 ( b ) ) . 
In addition , no product was obtained from 45 strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi isolated in Thailand and Vietnam and 35 stains of other S. enterica serovars ( data not shown ) . 
Southern hybridization showed that the 375 bp fragment recognized an EcoRI fragment greater than 20 kb in all z66-positive strains , but no z66-negative strains ( Fig. 3 ( c ) ) . 
We then examined the status of the ﬂiC in the z66 an-tigen-positive strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi by the PCR with primers PdS-A/PdB-B , which were designed from the central region of ﬂiC of Ty2 strain . 
Two fragments were ampliﬁed from z66 positive strains ( see Fig. 4 ( a ) ) . 
A 780 bp amplicon was obtained in S2 , which fragment was detected in the strain GIFU10007 and other z66 antigenpositive strains but not in z66 antigen-negative strains . 
( c ) Southern hybridization . 
The 380 bp PCR product was used as a probe and hybridized to EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from a subset of z66 antigen-positive and antigen-negative strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi .

The probes were hybridized to EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs of z66 antigen-positive and antigen-negative strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
A 4.0-kb hybridization signal was present in all strains . 
was identical to that in the strain Ty2 . 
A 520 bp amplicon was found in ﬁve strains , including the strain GIFU10007 . 
Sequencing revealed that these amplicons were identical to the ﬂiC encoding the d and j antigens , respectively . 
FliC was also examined in the z66-negative strains , the 780 bp amplicon was present in 60 strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi isolated in Thailand , Vietnam , and Japan ( data not shown ) . 
Primer pairs PdS-A/PdS-B and PdB-A/PdB-B were designed in central and terminal regions of the ﬂiC encoding d antigen of the type strain LT2 . 
We ampliﬁed two fragments of ﬂiC from Ty2 strain , a 340 bp fragment and a 1300 bp fragment that were used as the `` small '' and `` large '' probes in Southern hybridization experiments , respectively . 
The hybridization results showed that both two probes recognized a 4.0 kb EcoRI fragment in all z66 antigen-positive and antigen-negative strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi ( Fig. 4 ( b ) ) . 
Although the exact genomic location of the ﬂjB-like gene is currently unclear , it is possible that z66 antigenpositive strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi possess ﬂiC encoding the d or j antigen and the ﬂjB-like gene , which encodes the z66 antigen , at different chromosomal locations .

( a ) Mutant selection by PCR . 
After transformation of the suicide plasmid carrying a deletion of the new ﬂagellin into the wild strain S. enterica serovar Typhi GIFU10007 , PCR with speciﬁc primers F1A and F2B , which are located upstream and downstream of the new ﬂagellin gene , respectively , was used to test the resulting col-onics . 
Two amplicons , 2.3 and 1.1 kb were obtained from the duplicate mutant ( Dr ) . 
The 2.3 kb amplicon was obtained from the wild strain GIFU10007 ( Wt ) , and the 1.1 kb amplicon was obtained from a recombinant strain ( ﬂjB ) ) , which was the new ﬂagellin gene deletion mutant strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB from the wild strain GIFU10007 .

Investigation of the ﬂjB-like gene in strains of S. enterica serovar Typhi with altered ﬂagellin expression 
Flagellin phase variation in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium is important in virulence and involves hin gene and changing of the ﬂjBA promoter [ 2,9,22,24 ] . 
We investigated the ﬂjB-like gene and its promoter in strains that alter ﬂagellin expression in order to understand the mechanism underlying ﬂagellin expression changes in S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
GIFU10007 strain was incubated in the semisolid LB medium with anti-z66 antiserum for 48 h , z66 antigen-negative and j antigenpositive strains were obtained in two of six cultures , indicating that expression changed from z66 antigen to j antigen of ﬂagellin . 
PCR and Southern hybridization with the ﬂjB-like gene-speciﬁc probe were used to investigate the ﬂjB-like gene in strains with altered ﬂagellin expression . 
To our surprise , PCR products were not ampliﬁed with primers speciﬁc to the ﬂjB-like gene , ﬂjA-like gene , or upstream of the ﬂjB-like gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
Southern hybridization with the ﬂjB-like gene-speciﬁc probe conﬁrmed that the new ﬂjB-like gene was absent in strains with altered ﬂagellin expression . 
Hence , the ﬂjB-like gene and ﬂjA-like gene of the stain GIFU10007 were apparently deleted during the change in expression from z66 to j antigen of ﬂagellin . 
By antiserum screening , we did not detect the d or j antigen in the z66 antigen positive strains or in the strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB . 
Analysis of secreted proteins revealed that j antigen was expressed at high levels in the strain with altered ﬂagellin expression , but in strains GIFU10007 and GIFU10007-DﬂjB ( data not shown ) . 
The ﬂjA-like gene and promoter region of and ﬂiBA-like operon , which were absent in the strain with altered ﬂagellin expression , were contained in the strain GIFU10007-DﬂjB . 
We suspect that ﬂiC expression is inhibited by the FljA-like protein of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
When strains were cultured in the presence of anti-z66 antiserum , the frequency of ﬂagellin expression changing from z66 to j antigen in S. enterica serovar Typhi appeared to be lower than the frequency of ﬂa-gellin phase variation in S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium . 
Because it lacks the similar upstream of ﬂjBA , S. enterica serovar Typhi can not perform phase variations like S. enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
We speculate that changes in ﬂagellin expression in S. enterica serovar Typhi are caused by deletion of the ﬂjBA-like operon ; therefore , altered strains can not revert to expression of z66 antigen when cultured with anti-d or anti-j antise-rum . 
The mechanism underlying this deletion remains unclear ; however , a more comprehensive understanding of the regions deleted during changes in ﬂagellin expression may clarify this mechanism .

The phylogenetic relationship between the new ﬂjBlike gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi and other ﬂagellin genes 
More than 2300 serovars have been recognized on the basis of ﬂagellin antigenic properties [ 4,16 ] . 
Horizontal transfer and point mutations in the ﬂagellin genes ma explain the ﬂagellin polymorphisms in Salmonella [ 20,25,26 ] . 
The phylogenetic relations between the ﬂjBlike gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi and other ﬂagellin genes of Salmonella and other bacteria were determined by software ClustW ( Fig. 5 ) . 
This ﬂjB-like gene is most similar to ﬂiC of E. coli H27 with 75.6 % similarity in the full-length deduced amino acid sequences , and similarities as high as 98.4 % in the conserved N - and C-terminal regions ( amino acids 1 -- 187 and 406 -- 491 ) . 
The central region ( amino acids 201 -- 340 ) , which contains the presumptive D3 domain and a portion of the D2 domain of Salmonella ﬂagellin [ 4,6 ] , was only 40.8 % identical , and the longest identical stretch was only six amino acids . 
When ﬂjB-like gene was compared with ﬂjB of S. ent-erica serovar Typhimurium LY2 , the amino acid similarities in the conserved N - and C-terminal regions were 83.4 % and 96.3 % , respectively , whereas the similarity in the central region was less than 30 % . 
Although the ﬂjBlike gene was also similar to the ﬂjC genes of S. enterica serovars in the conserved regions , homology greater than 30 % was not detected in the central region . 
In conclusion , we identiﬁed a new ﬂagellin gene , which is located in a ﬂjBA-like operon and encodes the z66 antigen of S. enterica serovar Typhi . 
We observed deletion of ﬂjBA-like operon genes in response to anti-z66 antiserum , which may explain why S. enterica se-rovar Typhi ﬂagellin expression changes in only one direction , from z66 to either the d or j antigen .
