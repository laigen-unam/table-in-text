INTRODUCTION
The cellular response to a wide range of different stressors , including exposure to high temperature is represented at the molecular level by rapid synthesis of molecular chaperones , such as the heat shock protein ( Hsp ) 70 ( Miller and Qureshi , 1992 ; Morimoto , 1993 ) . 
This response is remarkably conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and is widely believed to play a pivotal role in host defense and survival ( Lindquist and Craig , 1988 ) . 
The induction of Hsp70 in response to stress serves to protect against the initial insult , augment recovery , and produce a state of resistance to subsequent stress ( Gerner and Schneider , 1975 ; Kregel , 2002 ) . 
It has been documented that acquired thermotolerance resulting from neonatal feed restriction ( Zulkifli et al. , 2000 ; Liew et al. , 2003 ) and thermal conditioning ( Wang and Edens , 1998 ) in broiler chickens could be associated with Hsp70 response . 
Although chronic stress may impede antibody production and cell-mediated immunity , thereby increasing susceptibility to viral infections ( Siegel , 1995 ) , neonatal feed restriction can improve resistance to marble spleen disease ( Zulkifli et al. , 1994a , b ) and infectious bursal disease ( Liew et al. , 2003 ) in heat-stressed chickens at market age . 
However , information on the link between neonatal stress and resistance to bacterial infections in chickens is lacking . 
Gross ( 1983 ) indicated that , while under-stressed chickens were less susceptible to Marek 's disease , their defenses against environmental opportu-nistic bacteria , such as staphylococci , streptococci , and coliforms , were adversely affected . 
Discrepancies in susceptibility to different pathogens may be attributed to the effects of corticosteroids and heat shock proteins either on the particular pathology involved or on the immunological defense mechanisms ( Siegel , 1980 , 1985 ; Wampler et al. , 2004 ; Malago et al. , 2005 ; Nemeth et al. , 2006 ) . 
Salmonella contamination of broiler carcasses continues to be a potential problem in the broiler chicken industry . 
Salmonella is considered the leading foodborne pathogen in humans ( Lynch et al. , 2006 ) . 
Environmental stress has been shown to be a factor that may induce colonization of enteric pathogens , facilitate

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Birds, Housing, and Diet
The study was undertaken following the guidelines of the Research Policy of the Universiti Putra Malaysia on animal ethics . 
In total , 90 one-day-old female broiler ( Cobb 500 ) chicks were obtained from a local hatchery . 
Upon arriv-al , the chicks were individually wing-tagged , weighed , and randomly assigned into groups of 6 to 15 battery cages with wire floors in an environmentally controlled room ( 2.3 × 9.1 × 3.8 m , height × length × width ) . 
Floor space allowed was 923 cm2 per bird . 
The ambient temperature on d 1 was set at 32 °C and gradually reduced to 23 °C by d 21 . 
The RH was between 65 to 75 % . 
All chicks were fed corn and soybean meal-based starter ( mash form ; 22.5 % CP and 3,100 kcal of ME / kg ) and finisher ( mash form ; 20 % CP and 3,200 kcal of ME/kg ) diets from d 1 to 22 and from 22 d onwards , respectively . 
The diets were formulated to meet or exceed requirements by the NRC ( 1994 ) for broiler chickens . 
Feed and water were provided ad libitum and the chickens were under 20 h of fluorescent lighting . 
Experimental Procedures
Commencing from d 1 , 30 chicks ( 5 cages of chicks ) were subjected to 1 of the following 3 feeding regimens : ad libitum feeding ( control ) ; 60 % feed restriction on d 4 , 5 , and 6 ( FR60 ) ; and 60 % feed restriction on d 4 , 
Corticosterone Concentration Analysis
On d 7 at 0830 h , following feed restriction , 2 chicks from each cage were chosen randomly and killed by decapitation . 
Trunk blood ( 3 mL ) was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and analyzed for plasma corticosterone concentration ( CORT ) . 
Each chick was caught and sampled , one immediately after another . 
This procedure did not exceed 45 s and should not influence circulating CORT ( Lagadic et al. , 1990 ; Romero and Reed , 2005 ) . 
Blood samples for the hormone assay were centrifuged and the plasma was stored at − 20 °C until assayed . 
The CORT was measured using a sensitive and highly specific RIA kit ( MP Biomedical , Irvine , CA ) and analyzed in an automatic gamma counter ( 1470 Wizard , Perkin-Elmer , Waltham , MA ) . 
Hsp70 Analysis
Immediately following decapitation , the entire spleen samples of 8 chicks ( out of the 10 chicks used for CORT determination ) were removed , frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 70 °C until further analysis for Hsp70 density . 
Spleen samples ( 0.3 g ) were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) using 3 mL of chilled Tris buffer [ 20 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 0.75 M NaCl , and 2 mM 2-mescapto-ethanol ] with 10 μL / mL of protease inhibitor cocktail ( lot no . 
P8340 , Sigma Chemical Co. ) and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C . 
The protein concentrations of the supernatants were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit ( BCA-1 , B9643 , Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , MO ) with BSA as the standard . 
The total protein ( 25 μg ) was loaded and separated on 10 % polyacrylamide gels ( 0.75 × 70 × 80 mm ) containing SDS , using a mini-gel apparatus ( Cleaver Scientific Ltd. , Warwickshire , UK ) . 
Gels were electrophoresed at 120 V until the tracking dye reached the base of the gel . 
The fractionated proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( MSI , Westborough , MA ) using a Trans-Blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell ( Cleaver Scientific Ltd. ) . 
After washing the membrane with distilled water , the nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 10 mL of cold blocking buffer ( Kirkegaard and Perry Labs Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) for 60 min . 
The membranes were incubated for 1 h with 5 mL 
horizontal transmission of pathogens between animals , 5 , and 6 plus 1,500 mg/kg of quercetin ( FR60Q ) . 
The increase pathogen shedding , and contribute to car - feed restrictions were 60 % of the previous day 's feed incass contamination during processing ( Mulder , 1995 ; take of the ad libitum group .

( 1994 ) indicated that Sal - St. Louis , MO ) is a naturally occurring flavonoid that monella enteritidis colonization and shedding increased inhibits the biosynthesis of Hsp70 by affecting several with short-term stresses attributed to heat , cold , feed , aspects of heat shock transcription factor activity ( Ho-and water restriction , and handling in laying hens .

heat stress and feed restriction can cause changes in the normal intestinal epithelial structure , which may lead to increased attachment and colonization of Sal-monella enteritidis . 
Induction of heat shock proteins , as a conserved stress response to thermal and nonthermal stressors , may act as epithelial surface receptors for pathogen binding ( Wampler et al. , 2004 ) . 
They also confer protection against inflammation by suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators , such as IL-8 ( Malago et al. , 2002 , 2005 ) . 
Nonetheless , the information on the possible effects of Hsp70 on Salmonella enteritidis colonization and shedding in poultry is lacking . 
This paper describes a study on the role of Hsp70 expression in resistance against Salmonella enteritidis in neonatally feed-restricted chicks under heat stress conditions . 
Heat Exposure
To elicit heat stress from d 35 to 42 , all chicks ( at the same time ) were exposed to an ambient temperature of 37 ± 1 °C and 70 % RH for 3 h daily . 
The time taken for the ambient temperature to rise from 24 to 38 °C was about 45 min . 
Feed and water were provided ad libitum throughout the heat exposure . 
Salmonella Source and Inoculation Procedure
A primary poultry isolate of Salmonella enteritidis , phage type 13A , was obtained from the Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology , Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Universiti Putra Malaysia . 
This isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid ( NA ; N8878 ; Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
The stock culture was grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth containing 20 μg of NA to inhibit the growth of other bacteria ( McElroy et al. , 1994 ) and stored with 20 % ( vol/vol ) added glycerol . 
Fresh cultures were grown statically overnight in Luria BertaniNA , transferred to fresh Luria Bertani-NA , and grown overnight for the challenge study . 
Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and were washed 3 times in equal volumes of sterile PBS . 
Cells were resuspended in PBS and spectro-photometrically quantitated to 1.5 × 108 cfu/mL . 
The inoculum was serially diluted and plated on XLT-4 agar plates containing 20 μg of NA to confirm the actual number of cells in the inoculum . 
On d 35 and before the onset of heat exposure , all chickens were individually inoculated with 1 mL of Salmonella enteritidis ( 1.5 × 108 cfu/bird ) with a syringe at the pharyngeal side of the tongue . 
On d 42 ( immediately after heat exposure ) , 8 chicks from each treatment group were randomly chosen and cecal content and spleen samples were collected after cervical dislocation . 
The spleen samples were divided into 2 parts : one part was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 70 °C until further analysis for Hsp70 density and another part was weighed and processed for Salmonella enteritidis enumeration . 
Care was taken to avoid cross-contamination of samples and nondisposable postmortem instruments used for removing organs were immersed in ethanol and flame-sterilized after each chicken . 
Briefly , for enumeration of total colonyforming units of Salmonella enteritidis in the cecal content and spleen , 0.25 g of each sample was placed into a sterile tube containing 2.25 mL of buffered peptone water ( CM0509 , Oxoid ) , homogenized ( T-25 basic homogenizer , Ultra-Turrax , IKA-Werke , Wilmington , NC ) , and serially diluted in buffered peptone water . 
Then , 100 μL of each dilution was placed onto XLT-4 plates containing 20 μg / mL of NA and spread with a bacterial cell spreader . 
Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and were enumerated for Salmonella enteriti-dis . 
Colonies were confirmed by biochemical tests on triple sugar-iron agar and lysine-iron agar and further identified as Salmonella enteritidis serologically using Salmonella O antiserum group D , factors 1 , 9 , and 12 ( McReynolds et al. , 2006 ) . 
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA ( SAS Institute , 2003 ) . 
Colony-forming units for Salmonella were logarithmically transformed before analysis to achieve homogeneity of variance and were expressed as log10 colony-forming units . 
Data for CORT were normalized using square root transformation . 
Correlation was calculated on Hsp70 density and Salmonella enteritidis count to describe any relationship between these parameters . 
Significant differences were further separated using Duncan 's multiple range tests . 
All statements of significance were based on P < 0.05 . 
RESULTS
Neonatal feed restriction resulted in a significant increase in CORT for chickens in the FR60 and FR60Q groups on d 7 ( Table 1 ) . 
The mean spleen Hsp70 densities of the FR60Q chickens were significantly lower than those of the other groups following neonatal feed restriction ( Table 1 ) . 
Following heat exposure , the FR60 and FR60Q chickens had significantly lower spleen Hsp70 expression than that of the controls ( Figure 1 ) . 
The FR60Q chickens showed the lowest Hsp70 expression . 
After 1 wk postinoculation , the trend in the number of Salmonella enteritidis colonies in the cecal content and spleen was similar . 
Chickens subjected to FR60 or FR60Q had a significantly lower Salmonella enteritidis count when compared with that of the controls ( Figure 2 ) . 
The lowest colonization was observed in FR60Q chickens ( 1.38 log10 cfu/g in the spleen and 1.96 log10 cfu/g in the cecal content ) , whereas the control group had the highest count ( 2.1 log10 cfu/g in the spleen and 4.42 log10 cfu/g in the cecal content ) . 
The relationship between Hsp70 density and Salmonella enteritidis count was positive ( r = 0.54 ; P < 0.05 ) .

DISCUSSION
The quercetin-treated diet significantly reduced Hsp70 expression on d 7 . 
This would be the first report on the in vivo inhibition of Hsp70 in broiler chickens . 
Neonatal feed restriction did not affect the spleen Hsp70 expression on d 7 . 
This phenomenon disagreed with the results of Zulkifli et al. ( 2002 ) , who showed an elevation in brain Hsp70 expression of early age feed-restricted broilers . 
The discrepancies between these studies could stem from the differences in the target organ . 
The Hsp70 expression was shown to be organdependent when the induction of the protein was studied in heat-stressed chickens ( Givisiez et al. , 2001 ; Zhen et al. , 2006 ; Yu and Bao , 2008 ) . 
Disease resistance is complex and involves various factors of the individual , population , and host patho-gen levels . 
There is considerable evidence to indicate that response and coping with environmental fluctuations can modify biological defense systems . 
Stressors may impede production of antibodies and effective cellmediated immunity , thereby increasing susceptibility to diseases ( Siegel , 1995 ) . 
Detrimental effects of extreme temperatures on immunocompetence in chickens have been well-established ( review by Thaxton , 1978 ) . 
The inhibitory and suppressive actions of glucocorticoids on the immune system may be the most important mediators for heat-induced immunosuppression . 
However , stress due to neonatal feed restriction ( Zulkifli et al. , 1994a ; Liew et al. , 2003 ) can improve resistance to marble spleen disease and infectious bursal disease in feed-restricted chickens in comparison to those fed ad libitum . 
The present findings indicate that following heat exposure , Salmonella enteritidis colonization in the spleen and cecal content of FR60 and FR60Q chickens were lower than that of the controls . 
Despite the disruption of stress response in FR60Q by Hsp70

344 SOLEIM inhibition , it appears that the FR60Q chickens had improved resistance to Salmonella enteritidis infection . 
The noted resistance was more profound in FR60Q than in FR60 chickens . 
A striking finding of this study is that the altered disease resistance was accompanied by a lower Hsp70 expression . 
Heat shock protein 70 acts as a chaperone through protein -- protein interaction to protect the already synthesized proteins against further inju-ry . 
In turn , induction of Hsp70 is known to protect against several stresses , including hyperthermia and ischemia/reperfusion injury , infection , and inflammation . 
Heat shock protein 70 confers protection against inﬂammation by suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators , predominantly IL-8 ( Malago et al. , 2002 ) . 
Heat shock protein 70 imparts an anti-inflam-matory role by inhibiting IL-8 production from mac-rophages and intestinal epithelial cells ( Malago et al. , 2005 ; Nemeth et al. , 2006 ) . 
The IL-8 is known as a chemokine that recruits polymorphonuclear leukocytes to inflammatory sites , a response that is vital to the inflammatory diarrhea caused by Salmonella infection ( Lee et al. , 2000 ) . 
Apart from the physical barrier , the instant innate immune response following pathogen invasion , including Salmonella enteritidis , is inflammation through cytokine production . 
These mediators are aimed at eliminating the pathogens and protecting the cells and their downregulation before resolving the inflammation stress , which would tend to favor the Sal-monella colonization . 
This downregulation is mediated , at least in part , by way of Hsp70 synthesis ( Yoo et al. , 2000 ; Malago et al. , 2005 ; Nemeth et al. , 2006 ) . 
These findings support the positive correlation between Hsp70 density and Salmonella enteritidis count noted in the present work . 
It is therefore compelling to hypothesize that part of the mechanism imparted by heat exposure to increase the Salmonella invasion involves downregulation of IL-8 production either directly via induction of Hsp70 synthesis or indirectly via glucocorticoid production and their immunosuppressive effect . 
The effects of neonatal heat conditioning and feed restriction on thermotolerance later in life have been previously investigated ( Yahav et al. , 1997 ; Zulkifli et al. , 2002 ; Liew et al. , 2003 ; Soleimani et al. , 2011 ) . 
It has been demonstrated that Hsp70 plays an important role in thermotolerance acquisition as a chaperone to interact with almost all newly synthesized , unfolded , or misfolded proteins ( Gething and Sambrook , 1992 ; Mayer and Bukau , 2005 ) . 
This is achieved by Hsp70 binding to a hydrophobic binding motif to prevent protein aggregation and facilitate protein refolding or degradation in response to stressful stimuli ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005 ) . 
Zulkifli et al. ( 2002 ) reported that neonatal feed restriction improved heat tolerance later in life by enhancing the ability to express Hsp70 in the brain . 
However , our findings concur with those of Bader et al. ( 1992 ) , Yahav et al. ( 1997 ) , and Guerreiro et al. ( 2004 ) that synthesis of Hsp70 is induced to a lesser extent in chickens that have acquired thermotolerance . 
No obvious reasons can be provided for the discrepancies between experiments . 
On a cautionary note , however , the contradictions may be partly attributed to the differences in protocols in heat exposure protocol or target tissue . 
The heat exposure used by Zulkifli et al. ( 2002 ) involved exposure to 2 h of heat stress at 38 °C , whereas in the study described here , chickens were exposed to 37 °C for 3 h. Although the difference in duration of heat exposure is 1 h and ambient temperature is 1 °C , it has been welldocumented that Hsp70 response is tissue-dependent ( Givisiez et al. , 2001 ; Zhen et al. , 2006 ; Yu and Bao , 2008 ) and also heat - and time-dependent ( Landry et al. , 1982 ; Gabriel et al. , 1996 ; Kregel , 2002 ; Yu and Bao , 2008 ) . 
The noted Hsp70 expression was higher in the FR60 than the FR60Q chickens in our study . 
This phenomenon may be associated with the degree of Hsp70 expressed during the neonatal feed restriction . 
There is a possibility that neonatal stresses may have evoked Hsp70 mRNA transcription , but the RNA may have been sequestered and not translated until exposure to heat later in life ( Craig , 1985 ) . 
In conclusion , it appears that neonatal feed restriction can enhance resistance to Salmonella enteritidis colonization in heat-stressed broiler chickens . 
The underlying mechanism could be associated with a lower Hsp70 induction in neonatally feed-restricted chicks .
