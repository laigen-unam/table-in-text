We report , herein , an attempt to determine whether an IL-10-induced immunological state affects the response of macrophages against Salmonella Typhimurium ( ST ) . 
Pretreatment with mrIL-10 induced the intracellular invasion of ST into macrophages in a dose-dependent manner . 
It also activated AKT phosphorylation , cyclin D1 , Bcl-XL , and COX-2 upon ST infection , which may correlate with Salmonella 's survival within the macrophages . 
However , I-κB phosphorylation was shown to be inhibited , along with the expression of TNF-α and MIP-2α mRNA . 
Therefore , IL-10 not only suppresses the bactericidal response of macrophages against ST , but also ultimately causes infected macrophages to function as hosts for ST replication . 
Keywords: IL-10, macrophage, Salmonella
During bacterial infection , macrophages perform a critical function in the removal of bacteria via endocytosis and phag-olysosomes , which are important defense mechanisms of macro-phages against exogenous pathogens . 
However , many bacterial pathogens employ their own strategies to avoid these mechanisms and replicate in macrophages . 
Salmonella , Mycobacterium , and Helicobacter are bacterial pathogens that evidence such abilities ( Monack et al. , 2004 ) . 
Salmonella spp . 
are Gram-neg-ative bacteria known to cause various diseases ranging from gastroenteritis and diarrhea to typhoid fever and sepsis . 
Although Salmonella Typhimurium ( ST ) is the etiologic agent of gastroenteritis in humans , it causes a systemic infection in mice that is similar to human typhoid fever ( Santos et al. , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella harbors two distinct virulence-associated genes , Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -1 and SPI-2 ( Haraga et al. , 2008 ) . 
Intracellular Salmonella releases a variety of `` effector '' proteins from the SPI system . 
Among these , SopB / SigD activates AKT/protein kinase B ( PKB ) , a pro-survival kinase , in host cells and suppresses host cell death to promote persistent Salmonella infection ( Knodler et al. , 2005 ; Fink and Cookson , 2007 ; Prost et al. , 2007 ) . 
Cytokines are crucial factors for determining the functional phenotypes of macrophages , and also regulate immune res-ponses . 
Upon pretreatment with cytokines before LPS stimulation , macrophages produce many different patterns of released cytokines ( Stout et al. , 2005 ) . 
Interleukin ( IL ) -4 and -13 stimulate the endocytosis of murine macrophages , while inter-feron-γ inhibits this process ( Raveh et al. , 1998 ) .

Additionally , two other intracellular pathogens , Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania major , require IL-10 for persistent infection ( Belkaid et al. , 2001 ; Beamer et al. , 2008 ) . 
These findings imply that IL-10 can play an important function in persistent infections by pathogenic bacteria . 
IL-10 , an 18 kDa cytokine , is produced in a broad variety of cells , including T-helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cells , regulatory T cells , DCs , B cells , macrophages , and even tumor cells ( Mosser and Zhang , 2008 ) . 
IL-10 also activates AKT phosphorylation via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway ( Williams et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , in an IL-10-dominant immunological state , the relationship between macrophages and Salmonella remains unknown . 
In order to address this issue , macrophages pretreated with IL-10 were infected with ST to assess the influence of IL-10 on ST infection . 
Changes in signal transduction and mRNA expression of various factors related to cell survival and immune responses were assessed . 
The M-15 Salmonella Typhimurium ( ST ) was used in this study , and grown in brain heart infusion broth ( Merck , Germany ) , at 37 °C overnight , with agitation . 
The murine mac-rophage RAW 264.7 cells were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank ( South Korea ) and maintained in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle 's Medium ( DMEM ; PAA Laboratories Inc. , Austria ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; PAA Laboratories Inc. ) , 100 U of penicillin , and 100 μg / ml of streptomycin ( Gibco BRL , USA ) . 
First , the effect of murine recombinant IL-10 ( mrIL-10 ) on ST infection of macrophages was evaluated via in vitro infection . 
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. For mrIL-10 treatment and bacterial infection , seeded RAW cells were washe with PBS , then incubated in antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 5 % FCS and mrIL-10 ( 10 , 20 , and 40 ng/ml ; BD Pharmingen , USA ) 4 h before the start of the infection . 
ST was diluted to a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 50 in antibiotic-free DMEM containing 1 % FCS . 
ST was added to cell cultures at an MOI of 50 and the cultures were centri-fuged briefly for 5 min at 500 × g . 
The plates were subsequently incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and washed two times with PBS . 
To remove extracellular ST , DMEM with 5 % FCS and 50 μg / ml gentamicin was added to each well . 
After 30 min , cells were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 ( Bio Basic Inc. , Canada ) in water , and then serial dilutions of the lysates were spotted onto DHL agar plates ( Merck ) . 
The amount of intracellular ST in the mrIL-10-pretreated cells was significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than that in the non-pretreated cells ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The numbers of intracellular ST were increased depending on the dosage of mrIL-10 . 
Additionally , in the cell-viability assay using WST-1 ( EZ-Cytox , Daeil Lab Co. Ltd. , Korea ) , mrIL-10-pre-treated RAW cells evidenced significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher survival than the untreated cells after ST infection for 18 h ( data not shown ) . 
These data indicate that IL-10 contributed to the ST invasion of macrophages . 
Next , we attempted to determine whether an mrIL-10-do-minant immunological state affects signal transduction , and mRNA expression related to the survival and defense of mac-rophages during ST infection . 
RAW cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h . 
After mrIL-10 treatment ( 20 ng/ml ) , the cells were infected with ST for 90 min at 37 °C , and harvested for Western blot and mRNA analyses . 
For Western blot analysis , the harvested cells were lysed in 0.4 M RIPA buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) . 
The isolated proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane . 
The membranes were incubated overnight with antibodies against phospho-AKT ( 1:1,000 dilution ) , cyclin D1 ( 1:1,000 ) , Bcl-XL ( 1:1,000 ) , phospho-IκBα ( 1:500 ) , and IκBα ( 1:1,000 ) ( all from Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) , GAPDH 
( 1:2,000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) , or COX-2 ( 1:1,000 , Cayman , USA ) . 
After 90 min of incubation with secondary antibodies , primary antibody binding was detected using a LumiGLO ® chemiluminescent detection system ( KPL , USA ) . 
For mRNA analysis , total RNA was extracted from the cells lysed with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen Co. , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA ( 1 μg ) via reverse transcription using M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . 
TaqManTM fluogenic probes and real-time PCR primers ( Table 1 ) were designed by Metabion Int . 
( Germany ) . 
Real-time PCR was conducted with a Chromo4TM real-time PCR system ( Bio-Rad , USA ) using the TaqMan-iQTM supermix kit ( Bio-Rad ) and analyzed using Opticon Monitor 3 analysis software ( Bio-Rad ) . 
A microliter volume of cDNA was used for RT-PCR amplifi - ® cation with a PCR premix ( Hotstart ; Bioneer Inc. , Korea ) ; PCR products were separated via electrophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gel . 
ST infection significantly induced AKT phosphorylation levels , but reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-XL ( Fig. 2 ) . 
In infected macrophages , treatment with mrIL-10 resulted in enhanced phosphorylated AKT , cyclin D1 , and Bcl-XL relative to untreated cells . 
AKT phosphorylation is regarded as an important mediator for the persistent intracellular proliferation of ST in epithelial cells ( Knodler et al. , 2005 ) . 
The phosphorylation of AKT is also correlated positively with the production of cyclin D1 , a critical player in cell cycle progression , and Bcl-XL , an anti-apoptotic protein ( Chang et al. , 2003 ) . 
In particular , cyclin D1 mRNA expression was downregulated upon ST infection ( Fig. 3A ) . 
We also evaluated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , known as prosta-glandin synthase , which is essential for the survival of ST within the macrophages ( Uchiya and Nikai , 2004 ) . 
COX-2 expression in infected macrophages was higher than that in uninfected macrophages , and the response was increased as the result of mrIL-10 treatment . 
Thus , our results indicate that mrIL-10 treatment can protect ST-infected macrophages against cell death via the activation of phosphorylated AKT , cyclin D1 , Bcl-XL , and COX-2 . 
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) , activated by the phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha ( IκBα ) , is a key transcriptional modulator of innate and adaptive immunity ( Hoffmann and Baltimore , 2006 ) . 
IL-10 activates the suppressors of cytokine signaling ( SOCS ) and prevents NF-κB activation ( Williams et al. , 2004 ) . 
We indirectly assessed the activity of NF-κB after infection by monitoring IκBα phosphorylation ( Fig. 2 ) . 
We determined that IκBα phosphorylation was increased in infected macrophages , and was attenuated by mrIL-10 treatment . 
We also analyzed the mRNA expression of TNF-α , macro-phage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -2 α , IL-10 , and TGFβ1 ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Consistent with a previous study demonstrating that ST and LPS trigger the mRNA expression of these factors in macrophages ( Rosenberger et al. , 2000 ) , our analysis showed that TNF-α , MIP-2α , and IL-10 mRNA were expressed at high levels by infected macrophages . 
However , the mRNA levels of TGFβ1 , another anti-inflammatory cytokine , were unaffected by ST infection and mrIL-10 treatment . 
The mrIL-10 treatment slightly alleviated the level of TNF-α and MIP-2α mRNA induced by infection , but enhanced the induction of IL-10 mRNA . 
We showed that the response of macrophages against ST can be determined by their immunological state . 
Macrophages in an mrIL-10-induced immunological state activate AKT , cyclin D1 , Bcl-XL , and COX-2 , which permitted intracellular ST survival and replication . 
Additionally , this study demonstrated that the immunological state down-regulates the immune res-ponses of macrophages by suppressing I-κB phosphorylation as well as the mRNA expression of TNF-α and MIP-2α . 
All pathogens need to establish a safe site as a replication niche in their respective hosts . 
Bacterial pathogens have evolved traits for survival in the host . 
These are classified into three methods ( Faherty and Maurelli , 2008 ) : ( 1 ) avoiding recognition by the host immune system , ( 2 ) inducing apoptosis in immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils , ( 3 ) mani-pulation and suppression of cell death . 
Many bacteria that can exist intracellularly , including ST and Mycobacterium , utiliz host immune cells for the progress of infection ( Prost et al. , 2007 ; Lee et al. , 2009 ) . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that cytokines produced by various immune cells , induce macrophages with distinct physiologies , and that macrophages are sequentially altered by their microenvironment ( Stout et al. , 2005 ; Mosser and Edwards , 2008 ) . 
It has previously been reported that ST stimulates IL-10 production in macrophages , and that the increased IL-10 levels affect the suppression of bactericidal functions of activated macrophages but not pathogen survival ( Uchiya et al. , 2004 ) . 
However , in this study we demonstrated that an mrIL-10-induced immunological state increased the invasion of ST into macrophages . 
The mRNA expression of IL-10 was higher in ST-infected macrophages than in uninfected macro-phages , and this response was enhanced by mrIL-10 treatment ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) . 
Additionally , the mrIL-10 treatment of infected macrophages promoted AKT phosphorylation , thereby inhibiting cell death . 
This result is consistent with a previous review describing the manner in which IL-10 can activate AKT phosphorylation via the PI3K signaling pathway ( Williams et al. , 2004 ) . 
Indeed , IL-10 appears to be essential for the persistence of infection with intracellular bacteria and viruses including Leishmania major , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , hepatitis C virus , and human immunodeficiency virus ( Belkaid et al. , 2001 ; Ejrnaes et al. , 2006 ; Beamer et al. , 2008 ) . 
Collectively , mrIL-10 promotes the survival of infected macrophages , which can create a beneficial environment for ST to reside within these cells . 
ST infection reduced cyclin D1 , an activator of cell proliferation , and Bcl-XL , an anti-apoptotic protein . 
However , these reductions were attenuated by treatment with mrIL-10 . 
We also determined that mrIL-10 treatment contributed to high COX-2 expression in infected macrophages , which triggers the expre-ssion of Bcl-XL ( Oh et al. , 2007 ) . 
Interestingly , a pathogenicity island on the ST chromosome , SPI-2 , activates the expression of COX-2 in macrophages for intracellular ST survival via the up-regulation of PGE2 or PGI2 , which participate in the inhibition of host defense systems ( Uchiya and Nikai , 2004 ) . 
In conclusion , we assessed the effects of IL-10 on macro-phages during ST infection . 
The results of the present study demonstrated that IL-10 increased the invasion of ST into macrophages in a dose-dependent manner via the suppression of the host immune response , and enhanced the survival of infected macrophages . 
Based on the results of these studies , it is presumed that mrIL-10-stimulated macrophages can function as carriers of systemic infections . 
Thus , the immunological state , governed by IL-10 , can provide beneficial effects for Salmonella , enabling the pathogen to circumvent the defenses of the host .
