ABSTRACT 
In stressful conditions , bacteria enter into the viable but non-culturable ( VBNC ) state ; in this state , they are alive but fail to grow on conventional media on which they normally grow and develop into colonies . 
The molecular basis underlying this state is unknown . 
We investigated the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS ( σ38 ) in the VBNC induction using Salmonella Dublin , Salmonella Oranienburg and Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 . 
VBNC was induced by osmotic stress in LT2 and Oranienburg . 
Dublin also entered the VBNC state , but more slowly than LT2 and Oranienburg did . 
The LT2 rpoS gene was initiated from an alternative initiation codon , TTG ; therefore , LT2 had smaller amounts of RpoS than Dublin and Oranienburg . 
Oranienburg had a single amino acid substitution ( D118N ) in RpoS ( RpoSSO ) . 
Disruption of rpoS caused rapid VBNC induction . 
VBNC induction was signiﬁcantly delayed by Dublin-type RpoS ( RpoSSD ) , but only slightly by RpoSSO . 
These results indicate that RpoS delays VBNC induction and that the rapid induction of VBNC in LT2 and Oranienburg may be due to lower levels of RpoS and to the D118N amino acid substitution , respectively . 
Reduced RpoS intracellular level was observed during VBNC induction . 
During the VBNC induction , Salmonella might regulate RpoS which is important for maintenance of culturablity under stresses . 
Key words osmotic stress , RpoS , stress response , VBNC . 
When exposed to harsh environmental stresses , bacteria struggle to adapt for their survival . 
One of the strategies , there is a mounting evidence that bacteria enter the viable but non-culturable ( VBNC ) state ( 1 ) . 
In this state , bacteria lose their culturability in conventional media , while retaining metabolic activity ( 2 , 3 ) , membrane integrity ( 4 ) , respiration ( 2 ) and slow gene transcription ( 5 , 6 ) . 
A series of bacteria could be recovered from the VBNC state to restart cell division by favorable conditions ( 2 , 3 , 7 -- 10 ) . 
The alternative sigma factor RpoS ( or σ38 ) is conserved within γ , β , and δ-proteobacteria ( 11 ) , and functions as a master regulator of the general stress response ( 12 ) . 
The strain-dependent DNA polymorphism of rpoS gene was reported in E. coli ( 13 , 14 ) . 
The RpoS binds to core RNA polymerase , which consists of 2 α , 1 β , 1 β ′ , and 1 ω subunit , to form the RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex ( 15 ) . 
By speciﬁcally recognizing the RpoS-dependent promoter sequence , RpoS directs

RNA polymerase to initiate transcription from promoters containing this sequence , thereby , governing the expression of numerous genes , most of which work under various stresses , such as nutrient starvation ( 16 ) , osmotic stress ( 17 ) , high hydrostatic pressure ( 18 ) , oxidative stress ( 19 ) , DNA damage ( 20 ) , and acid stress ( 21 ) . 
Thus , it seems likely that RpoS plays an important role in adaptation to the harsh foreign stresses ( 22 ) . 
Four conserved regions ( numbered 1 to 4 from the Nterminal end ) , have been identiﬁed in the σ70 family to which RpoS belongs ; some of these are further divided into subregions ( 23 ) . 
Region 2 and 4 are the most highly conserved among the various σ factors , and bind to the − − 10 and 35 promoter sequence motifs , respectively ( 24 , 25 ) . 
Region 1 is further divided into two subregions , 1.1 and 1.2 . 
Subregion 1.1 in Escherichia coli RpoD has been suggested to function as preventing region 2 and 4 from binding to DNA by covering them in free RpoD ( 26 , 27 ) , and mediating the binding of RpoD with core enzyme ( 28 , 29 ) , thereby inﬂuencing promoter binding and the transcription initiation by holoenzyme ( 25 , 30 -- 34 ) . 
Salmonella is one of the leading enteric pathogen , and its infection in human is most often associated with consumption of contaminated foodstuffs . 
We previously reported that Salmonella entered into the VBNC state under osmotic stress with its ability to return to the proliferation stage ( 35 ) . 
The RpoS function has been attributed to the osmotolerance mainly in E. coli , a model microorganism ( 12 ) , nevertheless it remained veiled how the RpoS associates with the entry into the VBNC state in Salmonella . 
In this study , we show the nucleotide polymorphism in the rpoS gene among Salmonella strains . 
Throughout the gene disruption and overexpression researches , we could demonstrate that the RpoS expression determines the VBNC entry of Salmonella cells under osmotic stress .

rpoS gene disruption 
The chromosomal rpoS gene in S. Typhimurium strain LT2 and S. Dublin strain KDX1 was deleted as previously described ( 36 ) , using the following primers : delta rpoS ′ F ( 5 - GAAATCCGTAAACCCGCTGCGTTATTTACCGC AGCGATAAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3 ′ ) and ′ delta rpoS R ( 5 - TTACTCGCGGAACAGCGCTTCGATA TTCAGCCCCTGCGTCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG - ′ 3 ) . 
The 64-bp region upstream of the initiation codon of the rpoS gene and the 973-bp initial region of the 993-bp open reading frame of the rpoS gene were deleted . 
The successful disruptants were subjected to western blot to conﬁrm inactivation of RpoS protein , and named KLX1 ( LT2 rpoS ) and KDX2 ( KDX1 rpoS ) . 
Plasmid construction
Routine DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures ( 37 ) . 
Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for DNA manipulations were purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo ( Japan ) , Toyobo ( Japan ) , and New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , MA , USA ) . 
Nucleotide sequences were determined using the BigDye Terminator v3 .1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
The 993-bp open reading frame of rpoS gene and its 32-bp upstream sequence containing natural ribosomal binding site was PCR-ampliﬁed from puriﬁed DNA of the LT2 strain and cloned into pBAD18 vector plasmid to obtain pAKO1 ( pBAD18 rpoSLT2 ) . 
The alternative TTG initiation codon of rpoSLT2 in pAKO1 was replaced by ATG to obtain pAKO2 ( pBAD18 rpoSSD ) . 
The D118N substitution was introduced into rpoSSD of pAKO2 to obtain pAKO3 ( pBAD18 rpoSSO ) . 
Induction of the VBNC state
Induction of the VBNC state was performed as previously ◦ described ( 35 ) . 
Brieﬂy , cells grown in NB medium at 37 C for 20 h were washed 3 times with 0.85 % NaCl , followed by × incubation in 7 % NaCl ( 5 volume of the original culture ) at 37 ◦ C. For plasmid-bearing cells , arabinose was added to the 16h-incubated cell cultures to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mM , followed by a 4 h incubation . 
Cells were then washed and subjected to incubation in 7 % NaCl solution , as described above . 
At the designed time points , 0.1 ml of the suspension and its serial dilutions were plated onto LB agar plates to determine CFUs . 
Viability was determined by the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 
BacLight-stained cells were observed under ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Olympus BX51 , Olympus , Melville , NY , USA ) , and images of more than 5 random ﬁelds were taken by Olympus DP70 system ( Olympus ) . 
Viability of at least 200 cells from a representative image was analyzed . 
In this study , we deﬁned VBNC state as bacterial cells which form no colonies on LB plates ( < 10 CFU/mL ) yet maintain high viability ( > 70 % ) . 
Detection of RpoS protein by western blotting
Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation , suspended in distilled water at an OD660 of 1.0 , and then prepared with Lammli sample buffer ( Bio-Rad , CA , USA ) . 
Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a PVDF membrane ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus ( BIO CRAFT , Japan ) . 
Western blotting was performed with an anti-RpoS antibody 1RS1 ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . 
RESULTS
Genetic variation of the rpoS gene among Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica
To know the existence of rpoS alleles among Salmonella , we searched the nucleotide sequences of rpoS gene from 15 Salmonella strains mainly through the NCBI database , except for S. Oranienburg Sa99004 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Since the genomic sequence of S. Oranienburg was not available , we sequenced the rpoS gene of S. Oranienburg strain Sa99004 , and deposited it in DDBJ under accession No . 
AB619833 . 
S. Typhimurium LT2 rpoS ( rpoSLT2 ) is known to start with the alternative initiation codon TTG instead of ATG , as previously reported ( 38 ) . 
The amino acid sequence of RpoS of 12 Salmonella strains , S. Typhimurium SL1344 , S. Typhimurium UK-1 , S. Typhimurium 14028S , S. Dublin , S. Choleraesuis , S. Schwarzengrund , S. Enteritidis , S. Heidelberg , S. Newport , S. Paratyphi A , S. Paratyphi C , and S. Typhi CT18 , was identical to LT2 RpoS ; however , their rpoS started with ATG unlike rpoSLT2 . 
S. Gallinarum and S. Oranienburg had a substitution at D14E or D118N , respectively . 
S. Paratyphi B had a nonsense mutation at the 243rd amino acid , where the GAG codon for glutamate was changed to the TAG stop codon . 
S. Agona had a 1338-bp insertion at the codon corresponding to the 259th amino acid and therefore exhibited extra 11-amino-acid sequence . 
S. Typhi strain Ty2 had a frameshift mutation caused by a single nucleotide insertion at the codon corresponding to the 311th amino acid , providing extra 73 amino acids . 
We selected three strains , S. Typhimurium strain LT2 , S. Oranienburg strain Sa99004 , and S. Dublin strain KDX1 to investigate the effect of differential rpoS alleles on bacterial survival and VBNC induction under osmotic stress . 
The rpoS alleles determine RpoS production in Salmonella
Given the DNA polymorphism of rpoS gene , RpoS protein expression was comparatively examined by western blot . 
In stationary phase , higher levels of RpoS were detected in S. Dublin and S. Oranienburg than in LT2 ( 2.2 - and 2.5-fold , respectively ) ( Fig. 2a and 2b ) . 
We then introduced the plasmids harbouring different alleles of rpoS gene ( rpoSLT2 , rpoSSD , and rpoSSO ) ( Fig. 2c and 2d ) into strain LT2 rpoS ( designated as KLX1 strain ) , and their RpoS production were comparatively examined under stationary phase . 
Plasmid pAKO1 ( rpoSLT2 ) did not alter the RpoS production level compared with the wild type LT2 strain , whereas the strains KLX1 harboring pAKO2 ( rpoSSD ) or pAKO3 ( rpoSSO ) exhibited greater amounts of RpoS than the wild type LT2 strain ( 5.7 - and 8.3-folds , respectively ) ( Fig. 2c and 2d ) . 
Thus , these results indicate that the alternative initiation codon TTG caused a reduction in the expression of RpoS while the D118N substitution did not affect it . 
VBNC induction in S. Dublin, S. Oranienburg, and LT2
The three strains were incubated in 7 % NaCl to measure the culturability and membrane integrity ( used as viability marker ) . 
At 2 days post incubation , LT2 did not form colonies ( < 10 CFU/mL ) , however , the viability remained at 72 % even at 10 days post incubation ( Fig. 3 ) , indicating that LT2 entered the VBNC state after 2 days of incubation . 
Similarly , S. Oranienburg Sa99004 entered the VBNC state after 3 days of incubation ( Fig. 3 ) . 
On the other hand , S. Dublin KDX1 still retained culturability at 1.1 × 102 CFU/mL at 3 days post incubation , and it took 5 days to enter the VBNC ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Together , these data indicated that those Salmonella strains displayed different time-course for the VBNC entry under the osmotic stimuli .

Osmotic stress reduced the amount of RpoS protein in the three strains ( S. Dublin KDX1 , S. Oranienburg Sa99004 , and LT2 ) during the induction of the VBNC state ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The amount of RpoS was rapidly decreased in LT2 and S. Oranienburg . 
The reduction rate at day 1 post osmotic stress in LT2 and S. Oranienburg was 50 % and 40 % , respectively . 
In contrast , RpoS protein was decreased gradually in S. Dublin , which took longest period to become non-culturable state . 
These results provide us to assume the potent involvement of the DNA polymorphism of rpoS gene in the salt-induced VBNC in Salmonella . 
In order to explore this idea , we disrupted the rpoS gene from the strains LT2 and KDX1 ( designated as strains KLX1 and KDX2 ) and their survival and viability were measured under the osmotic stress ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Microbial colony count assays showed that the strain KLX1 ( LT2 rpoS ) lost culturability earlier than the parental strain LT2 ( Fig. 5a ) , although both of them retained high viability

even after 7 days of incubation ( 85.4 % and 84.8 % , respectively , Fig. 5a ) . 
Similarly , S. Dublin strain KDX2 ( KDX1 rpoS ) also exhibited faster course of VBNC entry under the stress than the parental strain KDX1 whereas they did not show any signiﬁcance in the viability shift ( Fig. 5b ) . 
Together , these results indicated that disruption of rpoS gene accelerated course of VBNC induction in Salmonella by osmotic stress . 
Concerning the association of rpoS alleles with the RpoS production , we next used the strains KLX1 ( LT2 rpoS ) harbouring plasmids pAKO1 ( rpoSLT2 ) , pAKO2 ( rpoSSD ) , or pAKO3 ( rpoSSO ) to examine their physiological traits under the high osmolarity . 
These strains were osmotically induced to the VBNC state ( Fig. 6 ) ; strain KLX1 harboring empty vector entered the VBNC state at 1 day after exposure to the osmotic stress , while rpoSSD-expressing cells took longer to enter the VBNC state ( 6 days ) , indicating that the expression of rpoS delayed the entry of Salmonella into the VBNC state . 
The rpoSLT2 - or rpoSSOexpressing strains entered into the VBNC state at 2 days post incubation ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Together , we could show that the overexpression of RpoS , delays the VBNC entry in Salmonella .

DISCUSSION
The VBNC state is a strategy of non-spore-forming bacteria to survive under various stresses that are unfavorable for proliferation . 
In this state , bacterial cells are unable to proliferate to form colonies , but retain high viability ; thus conventional microbiological assays are unable to detect VBNC bacteria ( 39 ) . 
When the environmental conditions are once again suitable for proliferation , such as in a host 's intestine , the bacteria exit the VBNC state to a culturable state ( 3,7 -- 10 ) . 
It is reported that numerous bacteria , including pathogens , are able to enter the VBNC state and retain their virulence genes or factors in this state ; therefore , contamination of food products by VBNC bacteria is of public health concern ( 1 ) . 
The loss of culturability is one of the signiﬁcant features of VBNC cells . 
The possible involvement of RpoS in the bacterial culturability was suggested by previous studies ( 40 , 41 ) . 
However , little is known about its role in VBNC . 
In this study , we investigated effect of rpoS disruption and expression on VBNC state and intracellular levels of RpoS during induction of VBNC state , using S. Oranienburg , S. Dublin , and S. Typhimurium strain LT2 . 
The rpoS gene disruption caused rapid induction of VBNC state ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Expression of RpoS delayed induction of VBNC ( Fig. 6 ) . 
These results indicate that RpoS was not an essential protein to induce VBNC and that the presence of RpoS delayed VBNC entry . 
Rapid entry of rpoS-deﬁcient strains into non-culturable state was also observed previously in E.coli ( 40 , 41 ) . 
The E. coli parental strains reached the non-culturable state in 33 days under laboratory microcosms consisting of an artiﬁcial oligotrophic medium incubated at 4 ◦ C , whereas rpoS mutants lost their culturability in 21 days . 
However , the rpoS-deﬁcient strains failed to retain high viability , and rapidly died after entering VBNC . 
Thus , they concluded the involvement of the rpoS gene in E. coli persistence in the VBNC state . 
Their observation that rpoS-deﬁcient strains lost culturability more rapidly than parental strains was consistent with our ﬁnding . 
However , in our study , rpoS-deﬁcient Salmonella still retained the high viability as approximately 70 − 90 % during the observation period , which was comparable to parental strains . 
RpoS may not be essential to enter VBNC state in Salmonella spp. , however the presence of RpoS affects the length of time required to enter this state . 
It has been shown that considerable heterogeneity exists in the rpoS gene in E. coli ( 13 , 14 ) . 
In this study , we found such sequence variability at the rpoS locus in Salmonella by analyzing the gene sequence of different serovars of S. enterica ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Amino acid sequence of RpoS from 10 of 15 Salmonella strains , including S. Dublin strain KDX1 and S. Typhimurim strain LT2 , was identical . 
As previously reported , the rpoS gene in LT2 contains the rare initiation codon TTG ( 38 ) . 
S. Oranienburg strain Sa99004 was isolated from a patient in nation-wide food-borne outbreak in Japan caused by dried processed squid ( 42 ) , and found to have the substitution D118N in rpoS gene . 
We found that VBNC induction was rapidly induced in LT2 and S. Oranienburg compared to S. Dublin ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The variation of the gene may associates with functional variations that are involved in phenotypic variation . 
Thus , we investigated the inﬂuence of the alternative initiation codon TTG and the D118N mutation on VBNC phenotype of LT2 and S. Oranienburg , respectively . 
Since the presence of RpoS delayed VBNC induction , we examined the time required to enter VBNC and the intracellular levels of RpoS in LT2 , S. Dublin , and S. Oranienburg . 
The amount of RpoS was decreased in all strains during the course of osmotic incubation ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The levels of intracellular RpoS protein are regulated at the levels of transcription , translation , and proteolysis ( reviewed in 22 ) . 
We previously demonstrated that osmotic stress induced expression of Histone-like protein H-NS and caused DNA topological change in S. Oranienburg ( 43 ) . 
H-NS preferentially binds to intrinsically bent DNA . 
Although H-NS reduces the transcription of more than 100 genes , it also is shown to be a negative regulator for rpoS translation ( 44,45 ) . 
H-NS binds directly to rpoS mRNA to enhance cleavage of the mRNA ( 44 ) . 
Small regulatory RNA ( sRNA ) DsrA , which promotes rpoS translation by forming a complex with rpoS mRNA , is suppressed by H-NS in the same way . 
In addition to the regulatory effect of H-NS at the translational levels of RpoS production , H-NS is thought to positively regulate RpoS proteolysis since RpoS protein is more stable in hns-deﬁcient background ( 45 ) . 
Smaller fragments indicating degraded RpoS proteins were detected in stationary phase of LT2 , S. Dublin , and especially in S. Oranineburg before osmotic stress . 
But there were no signiﬁcant increase in amounts of smaller RpoS fragments during the course of high osmotic incubation , implying that down-regulation at the translational levels was presumably involved in rapid decrease of RpoS . 
We previously showed that H-NS was up-regulated in response to osmotic stress in Salmonella ( 43 ) . 
From these ﬁndings , it is suggested that H-NS is possibly involved in decrease in RpoS during induction of VBNC state . 
However , further work is needed to investigate this possibility . 
We introduced different types of rpoS alleles ( rpoSLT2 , rpoSSD , and rpoSSO ) from a plasmid in LT2 rpoS , and compared the VBNC phenotypes and intracellular levels of RpoS . 
The LT2 rpoS expressing rpoSLT2 showed the lowest levels of RpoS protein compared to other transformants ( Fig. 2c and 2d ) . 
As it is reported that usage of alternative initiation codons affects translational efﬁciency ( 46 ) , the alternative initiation codon of rpoS gene might inﬂuence the intracellular levels of RpoS protein at translational level , resulting in lower levels of intracellular RpoS . 
In fact , LT2 exhibited the lowest levels of intracellular RpoS protein compared to other S. enterica serovars Oranienburg and Dublin ( Fig. 2a and 2b ) . 
It seems that LT2 entered VBNC state rapidly due to lower levels of intracellular RpoS caused by the alternative initiation codon in rpoS gene . 
In LT2 rpoS background , RpoSSO showed similar amounts of RpoS protein to RpoSSD ( Fig. 2c and 2d ) . 
The time required to enter VBNC in RpoSSOexpressing cells is shorter than RpoSSD-expressing cells ( Fig. 6 ) . 
It is likely that LT2 rpoS with rpoSSO might cause rapid RpoS reduction resulting in rapid induction of VBNC entry , as well as S. Oranineburg did . 
This single amino acid substitution appears to be sufﬁcient to generate rapid decrease of intracellular RpoS in response to osmotic stress . 
As a result , VBNC state might be induced rapidly in S. Oranienburg . 
In addition to the possibility that the D118N substitution might cause rapid decrease of RpoS , there is another possibility that the D118N substitution might affect RpoS functions . 
This possibility is brought by crystal structure and mutational analyses of RpoD ( σ70 ) . 
The D118 residue of RpoS is located in region 2.2 which is the most highly conserved region among the σ70 family to which RpoS belongs ( 23 ) . 
Crystal structure analysis of RpoD ( σ70 ) revealed that this region made a helix and formed a coiledcoil structure with the helices of the other conserved regions , and this coiled-coil structure contained the core RNA polymerase binding region and promoter recognition site ( 47 ) . 
The residue corresponding to D118 of RpoS is conserved in RpoD ( 23 ) . 
A mutation in this residue of RpoD causes a severe defect in core RNA polymerase binding ; therefore , activity of the mutant RpoD to initiate the transcription is severely lowered ( 48 ) . 
From crystal structure and mutational analyses of RpoD , there is a possibility that RpoS D118N may be unable to successfully interact with core RNA polymerase and thus may fail to initiate the transcription of RpoS-dependent genes . 
As we described above , the substitution D118N seems to affect reduction rate of RpoS during VBNC induction or RpoS function to induce expression of RpoS regulon . 
As a result , S. Oranienburg might rapidly enter VBNC state . 
To clarify this point , further experiments are needed . 
In this study , under incubation in 7 % NaCl , Salmonella lost culturability ( 107-fold decrease in CFU ) but retained high viability ( > 70 % ) ( Fig. 3 ) , suggesting that cell division might slow down severely or be blocked in VBNC state . 
Although RpoS-regulating genes during VBNC induction is not understood yet , it is of interest that ftsQAZ genes , whose products are essential for cell division , are under regulation of RpoS ( 49 ) . 
Further studies about RpoS regulon during induction of VBNC are required to reveal the molecular mechanism of loss of culturability in VBNC state . 
The detection of a bacterial contamination has been traditionally determined by its ability to grow and make colonies on agar plates . 
The outbreaks of salmonellosis have frequently been reported as Salmonella was isolated from patients . 
But it is often the case that the bacteria could not be isolated from suspected food or environmental samples . 
There are many reasons for failure to identify the source of contamination , however it could be partly explained by the probable contamination of VBNC bacteria . 
S. Oranienburg strain Sa99004 used in this study was the clinical isolate of food-borne outbreak caused by ingestion of dried , salted squid , and can shift smoothly to non-culturable state under high osmotic environment . 
In food processing , the bacteria that face various kinds of environmental stresses including high osmolarity may enter a VBNC state , making their detection on culture media difﬁcult during quality control tests in food industries . 
Understanding of the molecular basis of VBNC state would provide insight into the physiology of bacterial stress responses and VBNC state , and may give a clue to develop novel detection method for VBNC bacteria .
