Abstract 
The full genome sequence of bacteriophage SPN1S , which infects Salmonella , contains genes that encode homologues of holin , endolysin and Rz/Rz1-like accessory proteins , which are 4 phage lysis proteins . 
The ability of these proteins to lyse Escherichia coli cells when overexpressed was evaluated . 
In contrast to other endolysins , the expression of endolysin and Rz/Rz1-like proteins was sufﬁcient to cause lysis . 
The endolysin was tagged with oligohistidine at the N-terminus and puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography . 
The endolysin has a lysozyme-like superfamily domain , and its activity was much stronger than that of lysozyme from chicken egg white . 
We used the chelating agent , ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , to increase outer membrane permeability , and it greatly enhanced the lytic activity of SPN1S endolysin . 
The antimicrobial activity of endolysin was stable over broad pH and temperature ranges and was active from pH 7.0 to 10.5 and from 25 C to 45 C . 
The SPN1S endolysin could kill most of the tested Gram-negative strains , but the Gram-positive strains were resistant . 
SPN1S endolysin , like lysozyme , cleaves the glycosidic bond of peptidoglycan . 
These results suggested that SPN1S endolysin has potential as a therapeutic agent against Gram-negative bacteria .

1. Introduction
As antibiotic-resistant bacteria become more prevalent , alternative therapeutic methods are required . 
Bacteriophages and endolysins are regarded as effective antimicrobial agents ( Loessner , 2005 ) . 
In general , double-stranded DNA bacteriophages lyse their host cells with 2 proteins , holin and endo-lysin . 
Endolysin synthesized without a signal sequence accumulates in the cytosol in the active form . 
Holin makes pores in the inner membrane , which allows the endolysin to reach its target , peptidoglycan . 
Endolysins typically cleave glycosidic bonds , peptide bonds , or amide bonds of the peptidoglycan , causing host cell lysis ( Baker et al. , 2006 ; Callewaert et al. , 2011 ; Mikoulinskaia et al. , 2009 ; Pritchard

et al. , 2004 ) . 
Contrary to canonical endolysins , studies on other types of endolysins exist . 
The endolysins of phages P1 and 21 , which have N-terminal signal anchor release ( SAR ) domains , are secreted to the periplasm by the host sec system . 
They accumulate in an inactive membrane-tethered form and are activated by membrane depolarization through holin ( Sun et al. , 2009 ; Xu et al. , 2005 ) . 
The Oenococcus oeni phage fOg44 endolysin , which has a typical signal sequence , was converted into an active form after cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide in a SecA-dependent manner ( Sao-Jose et al. , 2000 ) . 
Some phages do not encode an apparent endolysin ( Krupovic et al. , 2007 ) . 
In the case of Gram-negative bacteria , 2 additional proteins , Rz/Rz1 equivalents , contribute to the efﬁciency of the lysis ( Berry et al. , 2008 ; Krupovic et al. , 2008 ; Markov et al. , 2004 ) . 
In the lambda phage lysis cassette , there are 4 lysis genes : S-encoding holin and anti-holin , R-encoding endolysin and Rz and Rz1 . 
Rz is a type II membrane protein with a hydrophobic

N-terminal transmembrane domain and a periplasmic Cterminus . 
Rz1 is a lipoprotein attached to the inner leaﬂet of the outer membrane and the Rz1 coding region is entirely embedded within the Rz in the þ1 reading frame ( Summer et al. , 2007 ) . 
Bacteriophages have a number of advantages that make them compelling alternatives to chemical antibiotics , including their bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic activity , equal effectiveness against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the ability to disrupt bacterial bioﬁlms . 
Disadvantages include phage-resistant bacteria and the presence of bacterial toxins in phage lysates ( Gupta and Prasad , 2011 ) . 
To address these limitations , the use of puriﬁed endo-lysins has been studied . 
The lytic activities of puriﬁed endo-lysins have shown potential as therapeutic agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae , Bacillus anthracis , Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus , Lactobacillus fermentum , Listeria monocytogenes , Enterococcus faecalis , and Clostridium perfringens ( Fukushima et al. , 2007 ; Kikkawa et al. , 2007 ; Loefﬂer et al. , 2003 ; Nariya et al. , 2011 ; Sass and Bierbaum , 2007 ; Schuch et al. , 2002 ; Turner et al. , 2004 , 2007 ; Uchiyama et al. , 2011 ) . 
However , most studies on puriﬁed endolysins have focused on Gram-positive bacteria , since the peptidoglycan is directly accessible to exogenous endolysin . 
In the case of Gram-negative bacteria , the activity of puriﬁed phage lysis proteins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported ( Briers et al. , 2007 ; Miroshnikov et al. , 2006 ; Paradis-Bleau et al. , 2007 ) , while only a few studies on endolysins from the Klebsiella phage , Acinetobacter baumannii phage and Enterobacteria phage T5 have been reported ( Junn et al. , 2005 ; Lai et al. , 2011 ; Mikoulinskaia et al. , 2009 ; Miroshnikov et al. , 2006 ) . 
Previously , Salmonella Typhimurium-targeting bacteriophage SPN1S was isolated from environmental water and its genome was completely sequenced ( Shin et al. , 2012 ) . 
It has a circular genome consisting of 38,684 bp with a GC content of 50.16 % and 52 ORFs ( open reading frames ) . 
In addition , SPN1S , belonging to the Podoviridae family , infects S. Typhimurium strains and a few S. Paratyphi strains . 
In this study , an endolysin from the bacteriophage SPN1S was puriﬁed and its lysis activity was analyzed . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bioinformatic analysis
Prediction of ORFs in the lysis cluster of the SPN1S genome was done using Glimmer 3.02 ( Delcher et al. , 2007 ) , GeneMark.hmm ( Lukashin and Borodovsky , 1998 ) and Fge-neV software ( http://www.softberry.com ) . 
The ribosomal binding sites ( RBS ) were predicted with RBSﬁnder ( ftp : / / ftp . 
tigr.org/pub/software/RBSﬁnder ) for conﬁrmation of the predicted ORFs . 
Annotation of the predicted ORFs was done with the results from BLASTP ( Altschul et al. , 1990 ) , the NCBI Conserved Domain Database ( CDD ) ( Marchler-Bauer et al. , 2007 ) , and InterProScan analyses ( Zdobnov and Apweiler , 2001 ) . 
2.2. DNA manipulation
Bacteriophage SPN1S DNA was prepared as previously described ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . 
The holin , endolysin , and Rz/Rz1-like protein coding genes were ampliﬁed by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pBAD18 expression vector . 
For expression of an N-terminal oligohistidine-tagged endolysin , the endolysin gene was ampli-ﬁed by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET15b . 
The plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
2.3. Lysis gene conﬁrmation
Escherichia coli DH5a harboring a recombinant plasmid expressing each of the lysis genes or combinations of them was cultured in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 50 mg ml ampicillin until mid-exponential phase . 
L-arabi-1 nose was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2 % to induce expression of lysis proteins . 
Lysis activity was assessed by measuring the optical density . 
2.4. Endolysin puriﬁcation
The BL21 Star ( DE3 ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) strain was transformed with the pET15-lys plasmid . 
Expression of the recombinant endolysin was induced with 1 mmol l isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) 1 when the optical density ( 600 nm ) reached 0.6 , followed by incubation for an additional 3 h. Bacterial cells were suspended with buffer containing 20 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 8.0 ) 1 and 300 mmol l NaCl and disrupted by sonication ( Bio-1 ruptor , Diagenode , Denville , NJ , USA ) . 
N-terminal his-tagged endolysin was puriﬁed with nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose resin ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) with an imidazole gradient according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The puriﬁed protein was stored at 80 C in 20 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 1 8.0 ) , 300 mmol l NaCl , and 30 % glycerol .

2.5. Antimicrobial activity assay
An exponentially growing E. coli DH5a culture ( 10 CFU ml ) was washed and incubated in a buffer con-8 1 taining 20 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 8.0 ) and 100 mmol l 1 1 EDTA for 5 min . 
After centrifugation to remove the EDTA , the cell pellet was resuspended with 20 mmol l TriseHCl 1 ( pH 8.0 ) ( Ayres et al. , 1998 ; Junn et al. , 2005 ) . 
To analyze the antimicrobial activity of the endolysin , 10 ng , 50 ng , 100 ng , or 500 ng of endolysin was added to a 1 ml DH5a suspension ( 10 CFU ml ) and the reduction in optical density at 600 nm 8 1 was measured . 
The same volume of 20 mmol l TriseHCl 1 ( pH 8.0 ) was used as the negative control . 
The antimicrobial activity of 2 mg , 3 mg , 4 mg or 5 mg of lysozyme from chicken egg white ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA ) was measured in a similar manner . 
In an alternative assay , an exponentially growing DH5a culture was washed with 20 mmol l 1 TriseHCl ( pH 8.0 ) and diluted 100-fold in the same buffer , without pretreating with EDTA . 
Endolysin ( 3 mg , 5 mg , o 
10 mg ) was mixed with EDTA and added to a 100 ml cell suspension ( ﬁnal concentrations of EDTA were 1 , 5 , or 10 mmol l EDTA ) . 
For the negative control , an equivalent 1 volume of buffer was used instead of endolysin or EDTA . 
After a 20 min , 1 h or 2 h reaction time , the numbers of residual viable cells were measured by determining the colony-forming units . 
2.6. Effects of pH and temperature on enzyme activity
To test the thermostability of endolysin , aliquots of the enzyme were incubated at different temperatures ( 30 , 37 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 65 , or 75 C ) for 10 min or 30 min . 
The pH stability of the endolysin was estimated after 12 days at 4 C in the following buffers : 0.1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ( pH 2.0 ) , 50 mmol l sodium acetate ( pH 4.3 ) , 50 mmol l 2 - ( N-1 1 morpholino ) ethane sulfonic acid ( MES , pH 6.0 ) , 50 mmol l 1 Bis-Tris ( pH 7.0 ) , 50 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 7.5 , pH 8.0 1 and pH 8.8 ) , 50 mmol l glycine ( pH 9.5 ) or 50 mmol l N-1 1 cyclohexyl-3-aminopropane sulfonic acid ( pH 10.5 ) . 
After each treatment , the residual lysis activity was assayed . 
To determine the optimal conditions for antimicrobial activity , the enzyme reaction was carried out in different pH buffers and at different temperatures . 
As controls , cell suspensions that were not treated with endolysin were included in the assays . 
2.7. Antimicrobial spectrum
The bacterial strains used for antimicrobial spectrum determination are described in Table 2 along with the results . 
Gram-positive strains were grown to mid-exponential phase , then washed with 20 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 8.0 ) and 1 ml of 1 each cell suspension was used in the endolysin assay . 
Gramnegative strains were grown to mid-exponential phase and treated with 100 mmol l EDTA for 5 min . 
After centrifu-1 gation , the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mmol l 1 TriseHCl ( pH 8.0 ) . 
The cell suspensions were treated with 50 ng endolysin for 10 min and optical density was measured . 
2.8. Target site identiﬁcation
A crude peptidoglycan preparation of E. coli DH5a was prepared as previously described ( Fein and Rogers , 1976 ) . 
E. coli cell cultures were disrupted by sonication and unbroken cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation ( 1400 g , 10 min ) . 
The supernatant was centrifuged ( 27,000 g , 5 min ) and the pelleted crude cell wall was resuspended in 4 % SDS solution and boiled for 10 min . 
After cooling , the crude peptidoglycan was washed several times . 
In a 100 ml peptidoglycan solution suspended in 20 mmol l TriseHCl ( pH 1 8.0 ) , 100 ng , 500 ng , or 1 mg of SPN1S endolysin was added and the change in optical density at 600 nm was measured with a Sunrise microplate absorbance reader ( Tecan , Switzerland ) . 
After hydrolysis , unbroken peptidoglycan was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was assayed with a modiﬁed Park and Johnson 's method ( Park and Johnson , 1949 ) to investigate whether endolysin cleaves the polysaccharide backbone of peptidoglycan . 
Brieﬂy , aliquots ( 0.2 ml ) were mixed with 0.05 % ( w/v ) aqueous potassium ferricyanide ( 0.2 ml ) and 0.53 % ( w/v ) sodium carbonate / 0.065 % ( w/v ) potassium cyanide in water ( 0.2 ml ) . 
The mixtures were boiled for 15 min . 
Upon cooling , 1.0 ml of a ferric ion reagent ( ﬁnal 0.15 % ( w/v ) ferric ammonium sulfate/0 .1 % ( w/v ) SDS in 0.025 M sulfuric acid ) was added

3.1. Lysis genes of the SPN1S bacteriophage
The genome of bacteriophage SPN1S was fully sequenced ( GenBank ID : JN391180 ) . 
In the host lysis cluster of the 
SPN1S bacteriophage genome , there are 4 ORFs encoding the putative holin , putative endolysin , and putative Rz/Rz1-like proteins . 
Annotation and functional analysis of the ORFs in this cluster revealed that 2 ORFs ( SPN1S_0027 , 309-bp and SPN1S_0028 , 630-bp ) were homologous to the holin and endolysin of phage epsilon15 ( amino acid identity , 99 % and 94 % ) , a serotype-converting , group E1 Salmonella enterica-speciﬁc bacteriophage ( Kropinski et al. , 2007 ) . 
The other 2 ORFs ( SPN1S_0029 , 483-bp and SPN1S_0029_1 , 276-bp ) had homology with Rz/Rz1-like proteins of phage phiV10 ( amino acid identity , 80 % and 85 % ) , an E. coli O157 : H7-speciﬁc temperate phage ( Perry et al. , 2009 ) ( Table S1 ) . 
InterProScan analysis in this gene cluster showed that only the putative endolysin had any functional domains . 
The putative endolysin of SPN1S had homology to the lysozyme-like domain ( SSF53955 ) and its C-terminal region had a family 19 glycoside hydrolase catalytic domain ( PF00182 ) . 
On the other hand , the putative holin and Rz/Rz1-like proteins had transmembrane region ( s ) and a signal peptide region . 
In addition , the putative holin and Rz-like protein had unknown function domains ( PF05449 and PF10721 ) and the Rz/Rz1-like proteins had a PROKAR_LIPOPROTEIN entry ( PS51257 ) determined by PROSITE . 
ClustalW alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the putative endolysin were done with similar sequences from various prophages or bacteriophages ( Figs . 
S1 and S2 ) . 
The 4 genes were in tandem in SPN1S , with sequence overlaps of 11 bp between the holin and the endolysin and 4 bp between the endolysin and the Rz-like protein . 
Moreover , the Rz1-like protein overlaps the Rz-like protein in the other frame . 
To conﬁrm the functions of these genes , they were cloned into expression vector pBAD18 separately or together and expressed in the E. coli DH5a strain . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , none of the 4 genes affected growth of the E. coli strain when expressed alone . 
When all 4 were expressed together , there was strong lysis activity . 
Interestingly , the expression of endolysin and the Rz/Rz1-like proteins also yielded strong lysis activity . 
The SPN1S endolysin exhibited lysis activit when it was expressed with T4 holin , but expression of T7 endolysin with SPN1S holin or Rz/Rz1-like proteins did not show any growth defect ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Thus , it is possible that SPN1S Rz/Rz1-like proteins affect bacterial cell lysis only when acting together with SPN1S endolysin , indicating that the SPN1S phage has an unusual lysis system .

3.2. Enzymatic lysis activity of puriﬁed endolysin
The endolysin coding region was cloned into pET15b and transformed into BL21 Star ( DE3 ) , a high-performance host designed for improved protein yield in T7 promoter-based expression systems ( Aghera and Udgaonkar , 2011 ) . 
Total protein proﬁles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 3A ) . 
An overexpressed protein band of the expected size ( approximately 26 kDa ) was detected . 
The addition of puriﬁed SPN1S endolysin to E. coli is not expected to affect cell viability because endolysin is hydro-philic and can not cross the Gram-negative outer membrane to access the peptidoglycan ( Hermoso et al. , 2007 ) . 
Thus , we used EDTA to destabilize the outer membrane and allow endolysin to pass through it and reach the peptidoglycan . 
At ﬁrst , the lysis activity of endolysin was assayed by measuring the effect of endolysin addition on the optical density of the cell suspensions pretreated with 100 mmol l 1 EDTA . 
Addition of 10 ng ml endolysin did not have a strong 1 effect compared to buffer alone , however , gradually higher activities were detected beginning with 50 ng ml . 
Addition 1 of 500 ng ml endolysin led to lysis of most cells within 1 1 min ( Fig. 3B ) . 
This activity was very strong and the activity was approximately 30 times higher than the activity of chicken egg white lysozyme ( Fig. 3C ) . 
SPN1S endolysin was then added with EDTA to intact E. coli cells , instead of pretreating the cells with EDTA ( Briers et al. , 2011 ) . 
Without EDTA , endolysin did not affect the number of colony-forming units ( CFUs ) in the cell suspension . 
However , when added with EDTA , endolysin caused a dramatic reduction in bacterial viability . 
A combination of 30 ng ml endolysin and 5 mmol l EDTA resulted in an 1 1 approximate 2-log reduction in CFUs after a 2 h reaction time compared to the control with only 5 mmol l EDTA added , 1 and a more than 4-log reduction in CFUs when 100 ng ml 1 endolysin and 10 mmol l EDTA were added ( Fig. 4A ) . 
The 1 lysis activity varied not only with the concentration of endo-lysin and EDTA , but also with the reaction time . 
Fig. 4B shows the relative viable cell numbers after treatment with 50 ng ml endolysin and different concentrations of EDTA for 1 20 min , 1 h , or 2 h. Relative cell counts were calculated after setting the cell numbers in the untreated suspensions at 100 % . 
Within 20 min , 50 ng ml endolysin with 10 mmol l EDTA 1 1 reduced the bacterial cell numbers by 60 % and at 2 h by 99.8 % compared to the control with only 10 mmol l EDTA 1 added . 
In any condition , when the enzyme reaction time was longer , many more viable cells were degraded . 
The concentrations of EDTA used in this study and the oligohistidine tag did not affect the endolysin itself ( data not shown ) . 
Fig. 2 . 
Lysis activities of SPN1S lysis proteins with known lysis proteins . 
SPN1S holin and T7 endolysin ( A ) , T7 endolysin and SPN1S Rz/Rz1-like proteins ( B ) , T4 holin and SPN1S endolysin were expressed with 0.2 % L-arabinose at 2 h after inoculation . 
Viable cell numbers after 5 h of incubation for each culture wer measured ( D ) . 
SPN1S endolysin was stable from pH 4.3 to 10.5 for 12 days , but was unstable in pH 2.0 buffer with only 13 % of its lytic activity remaining . 
Although thermal treatment at temperatures up to 75 C for 10 min did not inhibit enzyme function , 30 min at elevated temperatures had a negative effect on its activity . 
Endolysin was active to some extent over broad pH range and temperature ( pH 7.0 to 10.5 and temperature 25 Ce45 C ) ranges but exhibited maximum activity in pH 9.5 and at 37 C . 
This data are shown in Fig . 
S3 . 
3.4. Antimicrobial spectrum
Nine Gram-positive and 21 Gram-negative strains were examined for their susceptibility to SPN1S endolysin ( Table 2 ) . 
SPN1S endolysin was able to lyse all of the tested Gram-negative strains at 50 ng ml within 10 min with the 1 highest activity against E. coli . 
However , no activity was detected against the Gram-positive strains . 
Even at 1000 ng ml endolysin for 1 h , there was no effect on the 1 Gram-positive strains tested . 
Thus , we conclude that SPN1S endolysin has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria . 
3.5. Target site identiﬁcation
Bioinformatic analysis showed that SPN1S endolysin has a lysozyme-like superfamily domain ( E-value , 10 ) . 
Lyso-44 zyme damaged bacterial cell walls by catalyzing the hydro-lysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetyl muramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan ( Nakimbugwe et al. , 2006 ) . 
To conﬁrm the predicted glycosidic bond cleaving activity of SPN1S endolysin , we analyzed the quantity of reducing sugar after peptidoglycan hydrolysis . 
E. coli peptidoglycan was treated with 1 mg ml , 5 mg ml 1 1 or 10 mg ml endolysin and dose-dependent degradation was 1 observed ( Fig. 5A ) . 
After lysis , the amounts of reducing sugar in each sample were measured . 
As with peptidoglycan degradation , the amount of reducing sugar in the enzyme digests was proportional to the endolysin concentration ( Fig. 5B ) . 
The buffer and enzyme itself at any concentration used in this experiment did not affect the results . 
To examine whether endolysin might have other activities , we performed a peptidase assay and an amidase assay with the same enzyme digests , but found no difference between the endolysin lysate and buffer ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , we concluded that SPN1S endolysin cleaved the glycosidic bond of peptidoglycan .

4. Discussion
In this study , we conﬁrmed the lysis activity of an endolysin homologue from SPN1S , a newly isolated bacteriophage infecting S. Typhimurium . 
Endolysin has a lysozyme-like superfamily domain , but showed much stronger lysis activity than lysozyme from chicken egg white . 
Several endolysins with lytic activity against Gram-negative bacteria were studied . 
The viable cell number of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was reduced approximately 4 logs by addition of 5 mg ml lysis protein EL188 and 1 10 mmol l EDTA ( Briers et al. , 2011 ) . 
The endolysin of 1 Klebsiella phage K11 reduced the optical density of sensitized cells approximately 10 % at a 10 mg ml concentration ( Junn 1 et al. , 2005 ) . 
The antibacterial activity of A. baumannii phage phiAB2 endolysin was approximately 30 % of the antibacterial activity of chicken egg white lysozyme ( Lai et al. , 2011 ) . 
SPN1S endolysin had greater activity than these endolysins . 
Fifty nanograms of endolysin were sufﬁcient to reduce the optical density of a 1 ml EDTA pretreated cell suspension by approximately 50 % . 
Indeed , SPN1S endolysin appears to be superior to lysozyme , with approximately 30 times higher activity . 
The peptidoglycan of all Gram-negative bacteria is ( almost ) identical . 
In addition , Bacillus contains A1g types of peptidoglycan like Gram-negative bacteria ( Schleifer and Kandler , 1972 ) . 
The different lysis pattern of Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus by SPN1S endolysin treatment might be caused by peptidoglycan deacetylation . 
Bacillus possesses deacetylase ( s ) , and a high proportion of the acetylglucosamine resi-dues in the peptidoglycan layer are de-N-acetylated by the action of peptidoglycan deacetylase ( Araki et al. , 1972 ; 
Hayashi et al. , 1973 ) . 
This modiﬁcation had the effect of making the bacterial cell wall resistant to digestion by lyso-zyme and these lysozyme-resistant cell walls were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by N-acetylation . 
Likewise , the Bacillus cereus peptidoglycan with N-unsubstituted glucos-amine residues , which is resistant to the bacteriophage T4 lysozyme , was converted into a sensitive form by N-acetyla-tion ( Kleppe et al. , 1981 ) . 
Similar to these , N-acetylation of B. cereus peptidoglycan with acetic anhydride made it sensitive to the lytic action of SPN1S endolysin ( data not shown ) . 
In general , endolysin can not act as an exolysin against intact Gram-negative bacteria ( Hermoso et al. , 2007 ) , since the outer membrane acts as a physical barrier preventing access of endolysin to the peptidoglycan . 
The peptidoglycan of Grampositive strains , in contrast , is easily accessible from the extracellular environment ( Fischetti , 2010 ; Lai et al. , 2011 ) . 
A few methods that increase outer membrane permeability in Gram-negative bacteria have been reported , including use of chelating agents like EDTA , high hydrostatic pressure or the attachment of hydrophobic peptides to endolysin ( Briers et al. , 2011 ; Morita et al. , 2001 ; Nakimbugwe et al. , 2006 ) . 
Success in making Gram-negative bacteria sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of endolysin suggests that phage endolysins might be used as therapeutics for not only Gram-positive bacteria , but for Gram-negative bacteria as well . 
With SPN1S endoly-sin , we observed that the addition of EDTA along with endolysin allowed for strong antimicrobial activity . 
There exist a few reports that phage accessory proteins like lambda phage Rz and Rz1 are involved in host cell lysis with respect to the outer membrane ( Berry et al. , 2008 ; Krupovi et al. , 2008 ; Summer et al. , 2007 ) . 
Lambda mutants lacking Rz/Rz1 have a conditional lysis-deﬁcient phenotype . 
Under standard laboratory incubation conditions , holin and endolysin are sufﬁcient for the lysis and release of the progeny virions . 
In the presence of high concentrations of divalent cations , however , bacterial cells infected with Rz/Rz1-de ﬁcient lambda phage do not lyse , but instead form mechanically fragile spheres ( Young et al. , 1979 ; Zhang and Young , 1999 ) . 
In the case of the P22 bacteriophage , the Rz/Rz1 homologues are encoded by gene 15 . 
P22 phage mutants lacking gene 15 display a 3 - to 6-log decrease in plating efﬁciency in the presence of divalent cations ( Casjens et al. , 1989 ) . 
Krupovic et al. ( 2008 ) reported that the Rz/Rz1-like accessory lysis genes of bacteriophage PRD1 were needed for full lysis . 
The lysis rate of PRD1 Rz/Rz1-de ﬁcient phage was only slightly less than that of the wild type phage in the absence of divalent cations , but in the presence of 10 mmol l MgCl2 , the lysis 1 rate was reduced dramatically . 
The authors suggested that the Rz/Rz1 complex transmits mechanical stress associated with the lesions caused by holin ( in the inner membrane ) to the outer membrane , ultimately leading to lysis . 
An alternative model was suggested for lysis mediated by phage lambda in which Rz/Rz1 are required for fusion of the inner and outer membranes , a step proposed to be necessary for the release of progeny virions ( Berry et al. , 2008 ) . 
Summer et al. ( Summer et al. , 2007 ) reported that Rz/Rz1 equivalents are ubiquitous among phages infecting Gramnegative bacteria . 
In a comprehensive bioinformatics study , they found 120 Rz/Rz1 equivalents in 137 phage genomes . 
In most cases in which the function of Rz/Rz1 has been studied , they are not essential for lysis . 
In SPN1S , the expression of endolysin with Rz/Rz1-like proteins was sufﬁcient for lysis . 
To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst example of phage lysis in which the Rz/Rz1-like proteins are critical . 
Further study will focus on determining the functions of the holin and Rz/Rz1-like proteins of SPN1S bacteriophage in lysis .
