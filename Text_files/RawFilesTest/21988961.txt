Abstract 
Effectors translocated into the host cell by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are critical for bacterial virulence . 
For many effectors , the mechanisms of their interactions with host pathways are not yet understood . 
We have recently found an interaction between the SPI-2 effector SseL and oxysterol-binding protein ( OSBP ) . 
We show here that SseL binds the N-terminus of OSBP and that S. Typhimurium infection results in redistribution of OSBP . 
We furthermore demonstrate that OSBP is required for efﬁcient replication of intracellular S. Typhimurium . 
This suggests that S. Typhimurium hijacks OSBP-dependent pathways to beneﬁt its intracellular life-style , possibly by SseL - and OSBP-mediated manipulation of host lipid metabolism .

1. Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimu-rium ) is a Gram-negative , facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that encodes two type three secretion systems , located on Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPI ) 1 and 2 [ 1 ] . 
Type three secretion systems ( T3SSs ) are needle-shaped macromo-lecular assemblies that allow bacteria to inject proteins ( effectors ) into host cells [ 2 ] . 
The SPI-1 T3SS is crucial during the early stages of S. Typhimurium infection and transfers effectors from extracellular bacteria across the host cell plasma membrane . 
These effectors initiate rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton , leading to the generation of membrane rufﬂes and resulting in engulfment and uptake of extracellular S. Typhimurium . 
They also mediate initial biogenesis of the Salmonella-containing vacuole ( SCV ) , a specialized

compartment in which intracellular bacteria survive and replicate [ 3,4 ] . 
These processes are in part mediated by manipulating host phosphoinositide composition [ 5 ] . 
Following bacterial entry , the SCV accumulates some markers of endosomal compartments while others are actively excluded , is positioned in proximity to the Golgi , and develops a tubular network of Salmonella-induced ﬁlaments [ 4 ] . 
These post-entry processes are commandeered by a separate set of effectors , which are translocated across the SCV membrane by the SPI-2 T3SS [ 6 ] . 
SPI-2 effectors have recently also been shown to be partially responsible for S. Typhimurium-induced interception of Golgi to plasma membrane secretory trafﬁcking and modi-ﬁcation of host cholesterol metabolism [ 4,7 ] . 
While recent research has shed some light on the cell biology of Salmonella infection and the biochemical functions of individual effectors , we are only just beginning to understand how the interplay between bacterial effectors and host pathways supports Salmonella intracellular replication and survival . 
To gain a better understanding of these processes , we have recently performed a proteomic screen to identify host protein interaction partners of SPI-2 effectors and found that the S. Typhimurium SPI-2-secreted effector SseL binds human oxysterol-binding protein ( OSBP ) [ 8 ] . 
SseL is a deubiquitinase that has been suggested to deubiquitinate and thus stabilizes the NFkB inhibitor IkBa , leading to downregulation of innate immune signaling [ 9 ] . 
OSBP is a lipid-binding protein that has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes , including nonvesicular cholesterol transport , signaling , lipid metabolism , and vesicular trafﬁcking [ 10,11 ] . 
OSBP comprises a C-terminal oxysterol-binding domain ( OBD ) that has been shown to bind cholesterol and some oxysterols with nanomolar afﬁnity [ 10 ] . 
The N-terminus of OSBP contains a pleckstrin-homology ( PH ) domain , a potential coiled-coil domain ( CC ) and an FFAT ( two phenylalanines in an acidic tract ) motif . 
The PH domain interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ( PI4P ) and the small GTPase ARF1 and mediates association of OSBP with the Golgi [ 12 ] . 
The FFAT motif is recognized by VAP-A , a resident protein of the endoplasmatic reticulum ( ER ) [ 13 ] . 
OSBP has been shown to directly transfer sterols between membranes in vitro , a process that depends on the presence of PI4P [ 14 ] . 
OSBP stimulates sphingomyelin biosynthesis in response to cholesterol and oxysterol and regulates ERK - and JAK2-dependent signaling cascades [ 15e17 ] . 
Moreover , phosphorylation of OSBP by protein kinase D ( PKD ) results in dissociation of OSBP from the Golgi , disruption of the transGolgi network ( TGN ) , and impairment of TGN to plasma membrane vesicular transport [ 18 ] . 
OSBP also binds the hepatitis C virus protein NS5A and enhances cellular secretion of viral particles , a process that is inhibited by PKD [ 19,20 ] . 
In this study we show that OSBP binds SseL via its Nterminus , in a region comprising a predicted coiled-coil domain and the FFAT motif . 
In S. Typhimurium-infected cells , OSBP localizes to intracellular bacteria , both in vivo and in tissue culture . 
We further demonstrate that OSBP is important for efﬁcient replication of intracellular S. Typhi-murium . 
These ﬁndings show that Salmonella can highjack OSBP-dependent functions during bacterial infection and suggest that SseL may play a role in this process .

2.3. Protein puriﬁcation
BL21 ( DE3 ) with pGEX-6P-3-HA3-SseL and pGEX-6P-3-HA3-SpvC were grown to OD600 1/4 0.75 and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37 C. Bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 10 mg/mL DNaseI , 10 mg/mL RNaseI , 200 mg/mL lysozyme , complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ) , and lysed using a French Pressure Cell . 
Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 C and supernatants loaded onto a glutathione agarose ( GE Healthcare ) column . 
The column was washed with 5 volumes each of PBS/0 .05 % Triton X-100 , PBS/0 .05 % Triton X-100 / 500 mM NaCl , and PBS . 
Proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 , 10 mM glutathione .

3. Results
3.1. The OSBPeSseL interaction is speciﬁc and mediated by the coiled-coil and FFAT domains of OSBP
We recently performed a quantitative mass spectrometry screen to initially identify host protein interaction partners of Salmonella SPI-2-secreted effectors [ 8 ] . 
Analysis of protein complexes precipitated from sseL-transfected and control cells revealed that OSBP-derived peptides showed a w7-fold enrichment in the presence of SseL as compared to control conditions [ 8 ] . 
To further conﬁrm that the interaction between OSBP and SseL is speciﬁc for this effector , we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using SseL and SpvC , another S. Typhimurium effector known to impact innate immune signaling [ 23 ] . 
HEK 293T cells were transfected with full-length OSBP or a vector control and lysates from these cells were mixed with puriﬁed HA-tagged SseL or SpvC . 
As shown in Fig. 1A , SseL , but not SpvC , was precipitated using an antibody directed against OSBP . 
In a reciprocal experiment , antibodies directed against HA-tagged SseL also precipitated OSBP , but not antibodies directed to SpvC ( Fig. 1A ) . 
This conﬁrms that OSBP and SseL interact and demonstrates that the interaction is speciﬁc to SseL .

IB : immunoblot , IP : immunoprecipitation , PH : pleckstrin-homology domain , CC : coiled-coi domain , FFAT : FFAT motif , OBD : oxysterol-binding domain . 
To test which domains of OSBP were responsible for SseL binding , we created two truncated Flag-tagged constructs of OSBP : OSBPN , containing amino acids 1e415 , and OSBPC , comprising the OBD and ranging from amino acid 416 to 807 ( Fig. 1B ) . 
As indicated in Fig. 1C , OSBPN , but not OSBPC , was precipitated with an antibody directed against SseL , and SseL was precipitated with an anti-Flag antibody only in the presence of OSBPN , not OSBPC . 
This indicated that SseL targets the N-terminal domains of OSBP . 
To further narrow down the SseL-binding region within OSBP , we created OSBPNN , which contains the Gly/Ala-rich N-terminus and the PH domain of OSBP ( amino acids 1e181 ) and OSBPNC , including the CC and FFAT domains ( amino acids 182e415 ) ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Immunoprecipitation experiments using these constructs showed that OSBPNC was precipitated efﬁciently with antibodies against SseL , and SseL was precipitated with anti-Flag antibodies in the presence of OSBPNC , while OSBPNN was unable to precipitate SseL ( Fig. 1D ) . 
This indicates that SseL speciﬁcally targets the region of OSBP containing the CC and FFAT domains . 
3.2. Enhanced presence of OSBP in infected epithelial cells
OSBP binding by SseL suggested that OSBP functions might be diverted in S. Typhimurium-infected cells . 
To examine whether S. Typhimurium affected OSBP 's normal cellular function , we used immunoﬂuorescence to stain for OSBP in infected epithelial cells . 
In uninfected HeLa , OSBP staining was observed in the cytoplasm , as well as associated with membrane structures , as reported previously by others ( Fig. 2A ) [ 24 ] . 
In infected cells , however , OSBP concentrated in areas of the cell where S. Typhimurium was located ( Fig. 2A ) . 
We furthermore assessed OBSP localization in the context of systemic S. Typhimurium infection by staining for OSBP in infected gallbladder epithelial cells [ 22 ] . 
Again , these experiments showed concentration of OSBP around intracellular S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2B ) and conﬁrmed an enhanced presence of OSBP in infected epithelial cells in vivo . 
Thus , infection has an impact on intracellular OSBP , suggesting that S. Typhimurium may divert OSBP-dependent functions . 
3.3. OSBP is necessary for efﬁcient Salmonella replication
To address the role of OSBP during infection , we reduced intracellular OSBP levels using siRNA . 
Treatment with siRNA directed against OSBP ( siOSBP ) resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of cellular OSBP levels as judged by immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 3A ) , but did not affect HeLa cell viability ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . 
HeLa cells transfected with either siOSBP or a non-targeting control siRNA ( siNT ) were infected with S. Typhimurium and intracellular replication was monitored for up to 8 h post infection . 
While we did not observe statistically signiﬁcant differences in S. Typhimurium invasion of siOSBP and siNT cells ( Fig. 3B ) , S. Typhimurium replication was signiﬁcantly impaired in cells expressing low levels of OSBP ( Fig. 3C ) . 
At 6 and 8 h post infection , relative CFU in HeLa cells transfected with siNT were 2.7 - and 2.1-fold higher than in cells treated with siOSBP . 
To conﬁrm that this effect was speciﬁc to OSBP , we transfected HeLa cells with an expression plasmid encoding OSBP and infected these cells , as well as vector-transfected cells , with S. Typhimurium . 
Conﬁrming the results of our knock-down experiment , overexpression of OSBP by this plasmid led to increased replication of intracellular S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 3A , D ) . 
Thus , OSBP-dependent processes support replication of intracellular S. Typhimurium . 
To determine if this effect depended on SseL , we repeated intracellular replication assays in OSBP knock-down and overexpressing cells with a sseL deletion strain of S. Typhi-murium ( DsseL ) [ 21 ] . 
Intriguingly , replication of the DsseL strain was not impaired in HeLa and was equally affected by OSBP knock-down and overexpression as wild-type S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 3E , F ) . 
This suggests that despite the speciﬁc binding interaction between SseL and OSBP , S

Typhimurium are able to exploit OSBP-dependent processes for their replication in the absence of SseL . 
4. Discussion
Research within the past decade has identiﬁed OSBP as a major regulator of cellular lipid homeostasis . 
In this study , we report a previously unknown role of OSBP in bacterial infection . 
We show an enhanced presence of OSBP in cells infected with S. Typhimurium and that OSBP cellular levels are correlated with S. Typhimurium replication rates . 
This suggests that S. Typhimurium has evolved mechanisms to exploit OSBP-dependent processes when establishing its intracellular niche . 
OSBP has documented roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis , TGN organization , vesicular traf-ﬁcking , and MAP kinase signaling , all of which are processes targeted by S. Typhimurium , particularly during its intracellular phase that requires maturation of the SCV . 
Consistent with this notion , we have recently shown that the S. Typhi-murium SPI-2-secreted effector SseL forms a complex with OSBP , suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for subversion of OSBP function by S. Typhimurium . 
However , we also observed OSBP-enhanced intracellular replication in a DsseL mutant , implying the existence of redundant pathways that allow Salmonella to beneﬁt from OSBP . 
We show that OSBP interacts with SseL via a region encompassing amino acids 182e415 . 
This region within OSBP contains a predicted coiled-coil and an FFAT motif . 
These sequences have previously been reported to be responsible for OSBP multimerization and for OSBP binding to VAP-A , which is thought to target OSBP to ER membranes . 
It is thus conceivable that the OSBPeSseL interaction may aid in the redistribution of cellular OSBP . 
S. Typhimurium-induced changes in phosphoinositide composition or Golgi organization may also play a role in this process , as OSBP interacts with phosphoinositides at the Golgi via its PH domain . 
OSBP has previously been reported to enhance replication of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . 
In analogy to what we observed for the Salmonella effector SseL , OSBP is bound by the HCV non-structural protein 5A . 
HCV and Salmonella both replicate extensively in the liver , resulting in excessive lipid accumulation and steatosis in this organ [ 25 ] . 
HCV furthermore requires lipid droplets for its replication [ 26 ] . 
This suggests that diverse pathogens have evolved comparable mechanisms to speciﬁcally intercept host lipid metabolism and that both HCV and Salmonella manipulate these pathways during the intracellular stage of infection , possibly through diversion of OSBP-dependent processes . 
SseL has previously been shown to have deubiquitinase activity [ 9,27 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that Salmonella may affect OSBP function through post-translational modiﬁcation . 
However , we were unable to show direct deubiquitination of OSBP by SseL ( data not shown ) and it remains to be determined if OSBP binding and deubiquitination are independent functions of SseL , or if OSBP may help direct SseL toward its deubiquitination targets within the host cell .
