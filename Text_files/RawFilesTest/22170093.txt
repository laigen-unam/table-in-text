Abstract Salmonella enterica serovar Pullorum causes substantial mortality in chicks as well as results in persistent infection and vertical transmission in layer birds . 
An effective innate immune response in the early stages of infection could reduce bacterial colonization and mortality in chicks and persistency of infection in later stages . 
β Defensins ( AvBDs ) are now considered as one of the key components of innate immunity in avian species . 
In the present study , we quantified the mRNA expression levels of AvBDs ( 1 -- 14 ) by real-time PCR in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tissues ( duodenum , jejunum , ileum and caecum ) of 3-day-old broiler chicks after 24 h of oral infection with Salmonella Pullorum . 
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant ( P < 0.05 ) upregulation of AvBD3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 12 and a significant ( P < 0.05 ) down regulation in the expressions of AvBD10 , 11 , 13 and 14 in one or few GI tissues , while no significant changes were observed for AvBD1 , 2 , 7 , 8 and 9 gene expressions in any of the GI tissues investigated upon infection with S. Pullorum . 
Most substantial change in gene expression was found for AvBD5 , being significantly ( P < 0.01 ) upregulated in most of the GI tissues investigated . 
The differential expression levels of β defensins shed light on tailored innate immune response induced by S. Pullorum during the early stages of infection in chicks . 
Introduction
Salmonella Pullorum , a fowl-specific pathogen causes systemic salmonellosis resulting in substantial mortality in chicks ( Shivaprasad 2000 ; Wigley et al. 2001 ) . 
Persistence of infection or carrier-status and subsequent vertical transmission through eggs are the major concerns with S. Pullorum infections of birds more than a week old ( Chappell et al. 2009 ) . 
Growing concerns over the use of antibiotics demands the use of novel strategies to encounter infections . 
Thus , knowledge on innate immune mechanisms operating during bacterial infection will help in modulating them in favour of controlling initial bacterial colonization and later vertical transmission of infection . 
Avian β defensins ( AvBDs ) are now considered as one of the key components of innate immunity in avian species . 
Defensins act as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and execute the anti-microbial activity by non-oxidative mechanisms ( Sahl et al. 2005 ) . 
Some defensins are also chemoattractant for monocytes , lymphocytes and dendritic cells , thus acts as a link between innate and adaptive immune responses ( Yang et al. 1999 ; Ganz 2003 ) . 
A total of 14 β-defensin genes ( AvBD1-14 ) have been identified in the chicken ( Lynn et al. 2004 , 2007 ; Xiao et al. 2004 ) . 
Innate immune gene expressions have been studied for Salmonella enteritidis ( SE ) and Salmonella typhimurium infections in chicken ( MacKinnon et al. 2009 ; Shaughnessy et al. 2009 ) . 
Unlike infections with SE or Salmonella Typhi-murium , S. Pullorum does not induce an inflammatory response in chicken intestine ( Henderson et al. 1999 ; Kaiser et al. 2000 ) and other studies also suggested that the pattern of immune response induced by S. Pullorum invasion might be distinct ( Chappell et al. 2009 ) . 
Avian defensins have been linked to host resistance to Salmonella intestinal carriage ( Sadeyen et al. 2004 , 2006 ) . 
Given the importance of defensins in Salmonella infection in the chicken and dearth of information on β defensins expression during S. Pullorum infection , the aim of this study was to examine the expression levels of all β defensins in the chicken ( Gallus domesticus ) gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tissues and to investigate whether these genes are differentially expressed in vivo during early stages of infection with S. Pullorum .

Materials and methods
Experimental birds
All the experiments were performed with prior approval of Institute Animal Ethics and Monitoring Committee . 
Day-old-commercial PB-1 ( Punjab broiler-1 ) chicks were obtained from Project Directorate on Poultry , Hyderabad , India and were reared in experimental facility of Microbiolgy division , College of Veterinary Science , Hyderabad . 
Birds were given ad libitum access to water and feed . 
Chicks were confirmed for free status of Salmonella by culturing faecal samples in buffered peptone water ( BPW ) for overnight and spreading on brilliant green agar containing 100 μg / ml nalidixic acid . 
Experimental infection with S. Pullorum and sample collection
Salmonella enterica serovar Pullorum , virulent field isolate , was obtained from the National Salmonella center , Indian Veterinary Research Institute , India . 
Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth at 37 °C in an orbital shaking incubator at 150 rpm . 
The bacteria were washed three times by pelleting at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in PBS . 
The concentration of suspension was determined by following standard plate count technique by plating serial dilutions of bacterial suspension and adjusted to 108 CFU/ml . 
Chickens were randomly divided into two groups of 12 each at 3 days of age . 
One group was orally inoculated with 0.5 ml of the bacterial suspension containing 108 CFU/ml and the control group was given 0.5 ml of PBS . 
A total of four chickens from each group were randomly chosen and were euthanized 24 h post-challenge . 
The entire GI tract was removed aseptically and a 50 mg piece of each tissue was removed from the middle of the duodenum ( D ) , jejunum ( J ) , ileum ( I ) and caecum ( C ) . 
The tissues were washed in PBS and placed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml TRIzol and immediately processed . 
In addition , swabs from caecum of both groups were taken and cultured in BPW overnight and streaked on brilliant green agar plates containing 100 μg / ml nalidixic acid ( 37 °C for 18 -- 24 h ) to confirm that control birds were uninfected and the challenged chicks were infected 
RNA extraction and Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from each tissue sample ( 50 mg ) using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer 's instruction . 
To avoid the possible traces of genomic DNA , 5 μg of each RNA sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 5 U of RNase free DNase , following this step DNase was inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min . 
Subsequently , first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo ( dT ) primer and MuMLV reverse transcriptase ( MBI Fermentas , Canada ) in a 20 μl reaction mixture following the recommendations of manufacturer . 
Quantitative analysis of AvBDs mRNA by real-time PCR
Relative quantification of chicken AvBDs ( 1 -- 14 ) in GI tissues was done by real-time PCR using the Mx3000P QPCR system ( Stratagene , USA ) and primer pairs specific for the amplification of AvBD genes , as previously described ( Ebers et al. 2009 ) . 
The amplification was performed in a total volume of 25 μl , containing 1X QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix ( SYBR Green I dye , ROX passive reference dye , HotStartTaq DNA polymerase and dNTPs with dUTPs in optimized buffer , Qiagen GmBH , Germany ) , 10 pmol of each primer and 0.5 μl of cDNA template . 
All primer sequences are presented in Table 1 . 
Thermal profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s ; annealing at 55 -- 60 °C for 30s and extension at 72 °C for 30s . 
Dissociation analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR to confirm the specificity of amplicon . 
In each PCR reaction no template control was included to check contamination of master mix . 
Non-reverse transcribed RNA ( 10 ng ) of each sample was used instead of cDNA to check contamination of samples with genomic DNA , failure of amplification confirms the purity of sample . 
To assess the efficiency of primers , standard curves for each prim-er pair were generated using serially diluted transcribed RNA sample . 
PCR efficiency was calculated from the slope of standard curves . 
The resulting threshold cycle ( Ct , a fractional PCR cycle number at which the change in reporter dye ( DRn ) passes the significant threshold ) values were normalized to the endogenous control , β actin ( ΔCt0Ct value of target gene-Ct value of β actin ) . 
To convey the inverse relationship between starting template concentration and Ct value , results were expressed and analyzed as 40-ΔCt values , interpreted as higher 40-ΔCt value implying greater gene expression ( MacKinnon et al. 2009 ) . 
The comparative Ct method was used to express the fold-changes in gene expression and calculated as 2-ΔΔCt ( Livak and Schmittgen 2001 ) .

Statistical analysis
All expression data are relative mRNA levels presented as Δ mean 40 - Ct values ± SEM . 
Student 's t-test with two tailed analysis was performed to evaluate differences between the infected and uninfected groups . 
Values of ( P < 0.05 ) were considered statistically significant . 
For presentation purpose the fold-changes are calculated as 2-ΔΔCt . 
However , statistical analysis was not performed on the fold-changes but only Δ performed on the individual 40 - Ct values for each AvBD gene . 
Results
All experimental chicks before the challenge study were free from Salmonellae . 
In all the chicks challenged with S. Pullorum , the organism was detected in cloacal swabs , in contrast , it was not detected in samples from control birds . 
Efficiencies of primer pairs specific for AvBD genes , calculated from the slope of standard curves ranged from 92 % to 100 % . 
AvBD gene expression analyzed by real-time PCR in control and infected chicken GI tissues are presented in Fig. 1 . 
The fold-changes in AvBD gene expressions in infected group as calculated by 2-ΔΔCt method are presented in Table 1 . 
Expression analysis revealed that all the 14 AvBD genes were detectable in GI tissues in both uninfected and infected groups , while expressions of AvBD2 and 7 were at very low level in the both groups . 
In the present study , quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant upregulation of AvBD3 in caecum ( 4.3 fold ; P00 .02 ) , AvBD4 in duodenum ( 5.5 fold ; P00 .005 ) , AvBD5 in duodenum ( 3.1 fold ; P0 0.04 ) , jejunum ( 3.19 fold ; P00 .007 ) and ileum ( 3.38 fold ; P00 .01 ) , AvBD6 in duodenum ( 0.87 fold ; P00 .01 ) and AvBD12 in duodenum ( 4.76 fold ; P00 .01 ) and jejunum ( 2.91 fold ; P00 .003 ) . 
Significant down regulation in the expressions of AvBD10 in caecum ( 2.04 fold ; P00 .02 ) , AvBD11 in duodenum ( 1.72 fold ; P00 .002 ) and ileum ( 3.93 fold ; P00 .02 ) , AvBD13 in ileum ( 1.95 fold ; P00 .02 ) and AvBD14 in ileum ( 2.46 fold ; P00 .014 ) and caecum ( 2.09 fold ; P00 .03 ) were observed . 
Whereas no significant changes were observed for AvBD1 , 2 , 7 , 8 and 9 gene expressions in any of the GI tissues investigated upon infection with S. Pullorum . 
Most substantial changes in gene expression were found for AvBD5 , being significantly ( P < 0.05 ) upregulated in most of the GI tissues investigated . 
Discussion
Innate immune system is crucial in very young chickens as the acquired immune system fully develops only after the first week of age ( Bar-Shira et al. 2003 ) . 
Growing evidences have demonstrated the significant role of β defensins in neonatal chicken in the control of infection ( Meade et al. 2009a ) . 
In the present study we investigated the mRNA expression levels of chicken β defensins in GI tissues upon S. Pullorum infection after 24 h in 3-day-old-broiler chicken . 
Expression analysis revealed that out of 14 AvBD genes , all were detectable in GI tissues of both uninfected and infected groups , while the gene expressions of AvBD2 , 7 were at very low level in both the groups . 
Differential constitutive expression of AvBD genes in developing chicken embryonic tissues as well as neonatal tissues have been demonstrated earlier ( Lynn et al. 2004 ; Bar-Shira and Friedman 2006 ; Ma et al. 2008 ; Meade et al. 2009a ) . 
Our finding of low expression of AvBD2 in GI tissues is in consistence with earlier reports from chicken ( Lynn et al. 2004 ) and duck ( Soman et al. 2009 ) suggesting the lack of its role in primary defense in the digestive tract . 
Minor discrepancies were observed in constitutive expression pattern of β defensin genes between the pres-ent results and earlier studies . 
It can be speculated that these discrepancies between these studies reflect differences between the experimental conditions such as variation in breeds , age and techniques used ( semi-quantitative RT-PCR vs real-time PCR ) 
In the present study , quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant upregulation of AvBD3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 12 and a significant down regulation in the expressions of AvBD10 , 11 , 13 and 14 in one or few GI tissues , while no significant changes were observed for AvBD1 , 2 , 7 , 8 and 9 gene expressions in any of the GI tissues investigated upon infection with S. Pullorum . 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in AvBD3 and AvBD7 in broilers were found to be associated with higher antibody levels of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis vaccination ( Hasenstein and Lamont 2007 ) . 
The present results are consistent with an earlier study that reported upregulation of AvBD3 and 12 gene expressions upon S. Typhimurium infection in chicken ( Meade et al. 2009b ) . 
Interestingly , in the present study AvBD3 gene expression was significantly upregulated in caecum whereas downregulated in ileum possibly reflecting the site of colonization in caecum and the host 's response to that . 
Upregulation of AvBD4 and AvBD6 in duodenum upon S. Pullorum in the present study may be important in encountering initial bacterial intestinal colonization . 
An earlier study demonstrated bactericidal activity of recombinant chicken AvBD4 , AvBD7 and AvBD9 peptides against Salmonella spp . 
( Milona et al. 2007 ) , however , they observed no changes in the gene expression of AvBD7 and 9 in small intestine of chicken upon oral challenge with Salmonella spp in similarity to the present results . 
Hence , this can be speculated as immune evasion strategy employed by the path-ogen . 
Akbari et al. ( 2008 ) also reported that AvBD1 and 2 gene expressions were not changed in caecal tonsils upon infection with S. Typhimurium . 
Recently Derache et al. ( 2009 ) also observed no change in AvBD2 gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells upon Salmonella challenge in in vitro assay . 
However , in contrast to our results , Sadeyen et al. ( 2006 ) earlier reported increases in the expression levels of AvBD1 and AvBD2 in the cecal tonsils of chicken inbred lines with Salmonella resistant trait . 
The observed discrepancy may be a result of differences in bacterial strains ( SE , versus S. Pullorum ) . 
Higgs et al. ( 2005 ) showed the strong expression of AvBD11 in small intestine of day-old broiler and demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of synthetic AvBD11 peptide against a range of pathogens including Salmonella and found to be most active against bacteria residing in the intestine . 
AvBD13 modulates the adaptive immune responses of chickens in vivo and in vitro ( Yang et al. 2007 ) . 
However , in the present study AVBD11 , 13 and 14 gene expressions were significantly downregulated in GI tissues upon S. Pullorum infection . 
Similar down regulation of AvBD3 , 8 , 13 and 14 gene expressions were found in Campylobacter jejuni infection model in chicken ( Meade et al. 2009b ) . 
In mouse and rat models , studies have shown that defensins could be downregulated by Salmonella in the intestine ( Rodenburg et al. 2007 ; Salzman et al. 2003 ) . 
The present results together with earlier reports confounds earlier speculation of this downregulation as immune evasion mechanism employed by Salmonella to avoid inflammatory reaction in initial bacterial colonization phase . 
Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) by toll-like receptors ( TLR ) activates nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , leading to the up-regulation of beta defensin-2 ( Vora et al. 2004 ) . 
Recently a study suggested that AvBD13 maybe an endogenous ligand for TLR4 and that AvBD13 enhances the proliferation of monocytes via the NF-κB pathway ( Yang et al. 2010 ) . 
We observed significant upregulation of TLR2 , 4 and 21 gene expressions in GI tract tissues of 3-day-old broiler chicks infected with S. Pullorum ( unpublished data ) . 
It is likely that LPS , flagellin , and/or secreted virulence factors of Salmonella function as PAMP to trigger the expression of TLRs and subsequent AvBDs by complex interlinked pathways . 
It appears that the β defensin genes play a role in the transition from an innate immune response to an adaptive response in the newly hatched birds apart from having direct anti-microbial activity ( Ganz 2003 ; Bar-Shira and Friedman 2006 ) . 
In summary , this study provides some intriguing insights into the pattern of innate immune gene expressions in the GI tissues in response to S. Pullorum infection . 
Furthermore , it identifies some key β defensins that are differentially regulated during the early stages of bacterial invasion of GI tract . 
Future works can concentrate on further elucidation of immune pathways TLR signaling and TLR and AvBD interlinks during the course of systemic salmonellosis . 
Modulation of these β defensins during early stages to check the initial bacterial colonization will help to reduce mortality in chicks and carrier state in adult birds .
