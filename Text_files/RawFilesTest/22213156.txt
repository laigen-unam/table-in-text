The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of sugar cane extract ( SCE ) on the biological activities of neutrophils in mice . 
Six-week-old BALB/c mice were fed 1250 mg/kg of SCE once . 
The generation , migration and biological functions of neutrophils and the survival rates of the mice in response to Salmonella typhimurium infection were evaluated . 
The results show that the numbers of both bone marrow cells and neutrophils were signiﬁcantly increased in response to SCE administration ( p < 0.05 ) compared with controls . 
The migration , phagocytosis and H2O2 generation of neutrophils were all signiﬁcantly enhanced in SCE-treated mice ( p < 0.05 ) . 
After challenge with S. typhimurium ( lethal dose , 50 % ( LD50 ) ) , SCE-treated mice had a 19.2 % higher survival rate and milder hepatic lesions than the controls . 
Additionally , fewer invasive bacteria were recovered from the spleens of SCE-treated mice . 
In conclusion , our results suggest that SCE has a positive regulatory effect on the biological function of mouse neutrophils that may increase host resistance against bacterial infections .

INTRODUCTION
During acute inﬂammation , neutrophils are recruited to inﬂammatory sites to defend against invading patho-gens , especially during bacterial infections ( Zemans et al. , 2009 ) . 
The process of leukocyte recruitment is initiated by chemokines derived from endogenous products , i.e. , IL-8 , C5a , and leukotriene B4 , that are secreted by several tissues in response to bacterial infection ( Choi et al. , 2009 ) . 
After neutrophils migrate to the site of infection , the natural defence functions of neutrophils , including phagocytosis and respiratory burst , are activated to kill ingested microorganisms ( Nauseef , 2007 ) . 
Meanwhile , during acute infection , granulopoiesis is up-regulated in response to the inﬂammatory stimulus ( Crabtree et al. , 2001 ) . 
The processes of granulocyte generation in bone marrow ( BM ) , release of granulocytes into the blood and migration of these cells to inﬂammatory sites are all closely regulated by various cytokines and chemokines ( Furze and Rankin , 2008 ) . 
Both granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) play critical roles in granulopoiesis , the dynamics of neutrophils in the blood , and the activation of neutrophils ( Shochat et al. , 2007 ; von Vietinghoff and Ley , 2008 ) . 
However , neutrophil function may be compromised by viral infections ( McNamee and Harmsen , 2006 ; Kubes et al. , 2003 ) , dysregulation of

Sugar cane extract ( SCE ) is a natural product that has a wide range of biological effects , including immunostimulation ( El-Abasy et al. , 2002 ) and anti-inﬂammatory activity ( Hikosaka et al. , 2006 ) . 
One study showed that SCE was able to restore immunity in immunosuppressed chickens treated with cyclophosphamide or X-ray radiation ( Amer et al. , 2004 , 2005 ; El-Abasy et al. , 2004 ) . 
Other studies on chickens indicate that SCE has a protective effect against Eimeria tenella ( El-Abasy et al. , 2003 ) . 
The effect of SCE on endotoxic shock has also been reported in mice ( Hikosaka et al. , 2006 ) . 
Our recent report also indicates that SCE can up-regulate porcine immunity by enhancing natural killer cell cytotoxicity and can decrease injury caused by pseudorabies virus infection ( Lo et al. , 2005 , 2006 ) . 
Although the effects of SCE on the biological function of neutrophils have been reported in chickens ( El-Abasy et al. , 2003 ; Hikosaka et al. , 2007 ) , the effects of SCE have not been fully elucidated in other animals . 
Therefore , we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of SCE on neutrophils and resistance to bacterial infection in mice . 
In this study , we found that the functional activities of neutrophils in mice are positively regulated by SCE , reducing damage caused by bacterial infection . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sugar cane extract . 
The SCE was kindly provided by Shin Mitsui Sugar Co. Ltd , Japan . 
The main ingredients , consisting of crude protein ( 16.9 % ) , fat ( 0.5 % ) , ash ( 36.1 % ) and nitrogen-free extracts ( 46.5 % ) , were extracted from sugar cane juice ( Saccharum officinarum L. ) by chromatographic separation on an ion exchange column ( El-Abasy et al. , 2002 ) . 
The SCE for oral administration used in this study was prepared by adsorption of the extract to oilcake of rice bran ( 1:4 ) and dried as previously described ( Lo et al. , 2005 ) .

Bacteria . 
A wild-type ( WT ) strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) ( No. 14028 ) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) . 
Bacteria were cultured at 37 C in tryptic soy agar ( TSA ) and stored in a 70 C freezer for further use . 
of positive cells 
Experimental mice and SCE administration . 
Five-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co. , Ltd. . 
After 1 week of habituation , the mice were divided into SCE-treated and control groups . 
Mice were fed SCE ( 1250 mg/kg ) once for the following studies . 
The use of mice in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of National Chung-Hsing University ( permit number : 97 -- 38 ) . 
Bone marrow ( BM ) cell and leukocyte counts . 
Mice were sacriﬁced using CO2 euthanasia . 
Blood was collected from the heart and transferred to a tube containing heparin ( 10 units/mL ) . 
The total number of leukocytes was counted using an electronic haematology counter ( Sysmex F-800 ) . 
Total BM cells were ﬂushed from both femurs with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and counted using a haemocytometer . 
Migration of neutrophils and invasion of bacteria in the spleen . 
Mice were fed SCE for 24 h and then injected intraperitoneally with 1 105 CFU ( in 0.5 mL ) of S. typhimurium . 
Four hours later , the mice were sacri-ﬁced , and the peritoneum was ﬂushed and eluted with Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 medium several times . 
The total number of cells was counted with a haemocytometer . 
Leukocyte differentiation was counted in Diff-Quik-stained cytospins ( Sysmex ) . 
To evaluate bacterial invasion , the spleens were removed and emulsiﬁed in sterile PBS 4 h after S. typhimurium inoculation . 
Emulsions were serially diluted , the bacteria from the spleens were plated on TSA , and CFUs were counted after an 18 h incubation period at 37 C. 
Phagocytosis and free radical production . 
Neutrophil phagocytosis assays were performed in whole blood and analysed using ﬂow cytometry as previously described ( Lo et al. , 2005 ) . 
Brieﬂy , a stock of FITC ( ﬂuorescein iso-thiocyanate ) - labelled S. typhimurium ( 4 109 CFU/mL ) was resuscitated and opsonized with antiserum containing polyclonal anti-Salmonella antibody . 
One hundred microli-tres of blood was incubated with 25 mL of S. typhimurium in an Eppendorf tube ( leukocyte : bacterium ratio = 1:100 ) in a 37 C water bath for 30 min and shaken occasionally . 
Bacteria bound to the surface of neutrophils were quenched with 0.08 % trypan blue . 
The red blood cells ( RBCs ) were further treated with RBC lysis buffer ( 155 mM NH4Cl , 10 mM KHCO3 , and 0.1 mM disodium EDTA ) . 
After washing , the cells were analysed using a FACSCalibur cytometer ( Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry system ; Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd. . 
BDIS ) and CellQuest software . 
The phagocytic activities of the cells were expressed as phagocytic indices ( PI ) : PI = ( % positive mean channel ﬂuorescence ) / 100 % ( Riber and Lind , 1999 ) . 
For free radical generation assays , activation of neutrophils was performed as in the phagocytosis experiments , except that non-FITC labelled S. typhimurium was used to stimulate the neutrophils . 
After a 30-min incubation period with S. typhimurium , 25 mL of dihydrorhodamine ( DHR ) 123 was added , and the cells were incubated at 37 C for 5 min . 
The ﬂuorescence intensity ( FL-1 ) was correlated with the amount of rhodamine , which is the product of DHR oxidation by H2O2 , and the results were expressed as respiratory burst indices ( RBI ) : 1/4 mean flourescence intensity % RBI 100 
Survival test and pathological examinations . 
To evaluate the effect of SCE on infection-induced damage and survival after S. typhimurium challenge , mice were divided into four groups : control , SCE administration once followed by S. typhimurium challenge 24 h later ( Group SCE/S . 
typhimurium ) , simultaneous SCE administration and S. typhimurium challenge ( Group SCE + S. typhimurium ) , and SCE administration once 24 h after S. typhimurium challenge ( Group S. typhimurium/SCE ) . 
Before challenge , 40 mL of NaHCO3 was administered to the mice to neutralize gastric acid . 
The mice were then challenged with S. typhimurium ( 1 105 CFU/0 .2 mL ) . 
Four days after S. typhimurium challenge , the mice were sacriﬁced for pathological examination . 
Additionally , the survival of mice after the S. typhimurium challenge was recorded for 14 days . 
Statistical analysis . 
Data are expressed as mean SD . 
Experimental results were analysed using ANOVA and Duncan 's multiple-range tests . 
p values of < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant . 
RESULTS
Effect of SCE on bone marrow cells and blood leukocytes
Twenty-four hours after SCE administration , the BM cells of two femurs were collected and counted . 
The total number of BM cells in SCE-treated mice ( 4.46 107 ) was signiﬁcantly greater than that in control mice ( 3.03 107 : p < 0.01 ; Fig. 1A ) . 
The number of leukocytes in SCE-treated mice ( 10.2 106/mL ) was also signiﬁcantly higher than in control mice ( 7.42 106/mL : p < 0.05 ; Fig. 1B ) . 
Effects of SCE on neutrophil migration and control of bacterial invasion
The total number of cells migrating to the peritoneum in SCE-treated mice ( 5.87 106 ) was signiﬁcantly greater than in control mice ( 3.94 106 :p < 0.01 ; Fig. 2A ) . 
Differential counts of migrating cells showed that the absolute number of migrating neutrophils in SCE-treated mice ( 3.55 106 ) was signiﬁcantly greater than in control mice ( 1.79 106 : p < 0.01 ) . 
In contrast , total number of migrating mononuclear cells in SCE-treated mice ( 2.18 106 ) was not signiﬁcantly different from that in control mice ( 2.06 106 ; Fig. 2B ) . 
To evaluate the invasion of S. typhimurium bacteria , the total number of bacteria in the spleen was counted at the same time . 
The number of S. typhimurium bacteria harvested from the spleens of control mice ( 2.9 105 CFU ) was signiﬁcantly greater than that from SCE-treated mice ( 1.5 104 CFU : p < 0.01 ; Fig. 3 ) . 
Effects of SCE on phagocytosis and H2O2 production by neutrophils 
Twenty-four hours after SCE administration , blood was drawn for neutrophil phagocytosis and free radical generation assays . 
The phagocytic index ( PI ) for SCE-treated mice ( 122.3 26.0 ) was signiﬁcantly greater than for control mice ( 81.1 26.6 : p < 0.05 ; Fig. 4A ) . 
Meanwhile , the respiratory burst of H2O2 generation of neutrophils after S. typhimurium stimulation in SCE-treated mice ( RBI = 44.0 26.7 ) was also signiﬁcantly greater than that in control mice ( RBI = 20.1 9.1 : p < 0.05 ; Fig. 4B ) .

After S. typhimurium inoculation , mice developed severe clinical symptoms and died 4 days later . 
Therefore , the pathological lesions were scored on the fourth day after S. typhimurium inoculation . 
Most S. typhimurium-infected mice developed obvious hepatic lesions characterized by focal necrosis with mononuclear cell inﬁltration and re-ticular cell proliferation . 
To compare the severity of the hepatic lesions in different treatment groups , the average numbers of necrotic foci in ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds ( 200 magniﬁcation ) were scored . 
The frequency of mice with hepatic lesions in the SCE/S . 
typhimurium , SCE + S. typhimurium , S. typhimurium/SCE , and distilled water ( DW ) / S. typhimurium groups was 33 % ( 1/3 ) , 50 % ( 2/4 ) , 75 % ( 3/4 ) , and 100 % ( 4/4 ) , respectively . 
Meanwhile , the average number of necrotic foci per ﬁeld in the four groups were 1.7 2.9 , 5.0 5.2 , 7.5 5.3 , and 12.5 3.5 , respectively ( Fig. 5A ) . 
Effect of SCE administration on the survival of mice infected with S. typhimurium
After the mice were inoculated with an LD50 dose of S. typhimurium ( 1 105 CFU/mouse ) , the survival of the mice was continuously monitored for 14 days . 
At 4 days post-inoculation , mice began to die . 
The survival rate in the SCE/S . 
typhimurium , SCE + S. typhimurium , S. typhimurium/SCE and DW/S . 
typhimurium groups were 63.6 % ( 7/11 ) , 55.5 % ( 5/9 ) , 44.4 % ( 4/9 ) , and 44.4 % 
( 4/9 ) , respectively . 
There was a 19.2 % higher survival rate in the SCE/S . 
typhimurium group than in the control group ( Fig. 5B ) . 
DISCUSSION
In this study , we showed that SCE can up-regulate granulopoiesis and the biological functions of neutrophils , increasing host resistance to S. typhimurium infection . 
Sugar cane extract is a compound of extracts derived from sugar cane juice that contains compounds , including polyphenols , which can enhance the biological activities of leukocytes ( Takara et al. , 2002 ; Hikosaka et al. , 2007 ) . 
Fever , leukocytosis and the production of acute-phase proteins are major responses during acute inﬂammation ( Crabtree et al. , 2001 ) . 
Both neutrophil migration to the site of infection and increased leukocyte production in the bone marrow are very important in ﬁghting acute bacterial infections . 
The processes of increasing the generation and maturation of neutrophils are regulated by a panel of cytokines , including stromal cell factor , IL-1 , IL-3 , IL-6 , GM-CSF and G-CSF , that is induced by inﬂammatory stimuli ( Dale , 2009 ) . 
It takes 60 h for metamyelocytes to develop and 50 to 72 h for these cells to mature into neutrophils , a process in which GM-CSF and G-CSF are critically important ( Abbas , 2007 ) . 
In this experiment , the numbers of both bone marrow cells and blood leukocytes were signiﬁcantly increased a short time ( 24 h ) after SCE administration . 
When mice were fed SCE for three consecutive days , the number of BM cells was double that observed when mice were fed SCE for only one day ( data not shown ) . 
These results suggest that SCE may stimulate some cells to secrete cyto-kines , particularly GM-CSF and/or G-CSF , to promote myeloid cell proliferation and neutrophil maturation . 
However , the stimulation of cytokine production by SCE requires further elucidation . 
Additionally , our observation of increased haematopoiesis conﬁrmed previous reports suggesting that the administration of SCE restored BM function and immunity in chickens that were immunosuppressed by X-ray radiation or cyclophosphamide ( El-abasy et al. , 2004 ; Amer et al. , 2004 , 2005 ) . 
In chronic granulomatous diseases , intracellular killing of phagocytes is impaired due to a defect in the nicotin-amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH ) oxidase responsible for the production of superoxide ( Holland , 2010 ) . 
Classic swine fever virus can impair haematopoiesis , leading to granulocytopenia ( Summerﬁeld et al. , 2000 ) . 
Both defects are responsible for secondary bacterial infections , suggesting that both the number and biological functions of neutrophils are very important in controlling bacterial replication and invasion . 
We used intraperitoneal injection of S. typhimurium to evaluate leukocyte migration . 
We found more neutrophils and higher neutrophil-to-mono-nuclear cell ratios in SCE-treated mice compared with controls , suggesting that SCE can enhance neutrophil migration into inﬂammatory sites in response to acute bacterial infection . 
After migration to the inﬂammatory site , phagocytosis and intracellular killing activities are initiated by bacterial components that bind to toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -4 or TLR-2 of phagocytes . 
Cytoplasmic NADPH oxidase activity is subsequently activated to generate free radicals ( Sabroe et al. , 2005 ) . 
Phagocytic activity and the generation of free radicals were also up-regulated in response to S. typhimurium stimulation in SCE-treated mice , similar to previous reports of chickens treated with SCE or the polyphenol-rich fraction of SCE ( El-Abasy et al. , 2002 ; Hikosaka et al. , 2007 ) . 
Though positive regulation of neutrophil phagocytosis has been noted in pigs , it did not reach signiﬁcance in SCE-treated pigs due to a high degree of variation between individual animals ( Lo et al. , 2005 ) . 
Mice are susceptible to S. typhimurium infection , which is characterized by severe hepatic lesions . 
After infection , S. typhimurium invades the intestinal epithelial barrier , is phagocytosed by phagocytes , is transported to the mesenteric lymph node , and then enters the bloodstream ( Tam et al. , 2008 ) . 
Our preliminary kinetic test indicates that a 50 % up-regulation of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils occurred in mice after administration of 1250 mg/kg SCE once for 24 h ( data not shown ) . 
After S. typhimurium infection , mice developed severe clinical symptoms and began dying 4 days post-infection . 
Typical paratyphoid nodules were noted in the livers of S. typhimurium infected mice . 
However , compared with controls , a 2.5 - to 7.3-fold decrease in necrotic foci was noted in SCE-treated mice , especially in those pre-treated with SCE . 
Neutrophils rapidly migrated to inﬂammatory sites and produced higher levels of free radicals to kill bacteria in SCE-treated mice . 
These functional enhancements in neutrophil activity were also apparent in the reduced number of bacteria in the spleen , the reduced number of hepatic lesions , and the improved survival of SCE-treated mice compared with control mice . 
Additionally , it has been reported that SCE can improve the resistance of mice to endotoxin treatment ( Hikosaka et al. , 2006 ; Motobu et al. , 2006 ) , suggesting that the scavenger activity of reactive oxygen intermediates and the inhibition of inﬂammatory mediators by polyphenol or SCE may contribute to the decrease in the number of hepatic lesions caused by S. typhimurium endotoxin ( Murakami et al. , 2005 ) . 
Therefore , the increased leukocyte numbers , the enhanced biological activity of neutrophils , and the resistance to endotoxic shock may be reﬂected in a lower number of hepatic lesions and the higher survival rates of SCE-treated mice . 
In contrast , SCE treatment after bacterial infection was less effective in controlling bacterial replication and invasion . 
As the components of SCE , aside from polyphenols ( Hikosaka et al. , 2007 ) , have not been clearly identiﬁed , the mechanism by which SCE exerts its immunostimulatory activity still requires further elucidation . 
However , the present results and previous reports have shown that SCE can enhance the function of neutrophils and IFN-g production by lymphocytes , suggesting that SCE regulates a cytokine network that increases haematopoiesis , activates early innate immunity and regulates the biological activity of neutrophils . 
Therefore , proper administration of SCE in feed before the onset of disease may reduce bacteria-induced damage in infected animals .
