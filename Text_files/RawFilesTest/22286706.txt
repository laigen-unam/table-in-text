Generation of a live attenuated vaccine for bacterial pathogens often requires prior knowledge of the pathogen 's virulence factors . 
We hypothesized an alternative approach of heterologous gene expression would make a wild-type ( wt ) pathogen more susceptible to host cell killing , thus , resulting in immunization . 
As proof of concept , the heterologous expression of 2012 Landes Bioscienc enterotoxigenic E. coli ( ETEC ) colonization factor antigen I ( CFA/I ) was tested to attenuate Salmonella . 
The overexpression of CFA/I resulted in significant attenuation of wt Salmonella . 
In-depth studies revealed the attenuation depended on the co-expression of chaperone ( CfaA ) and usher ( CfaC ) proteins . 
Remarkably , the CfaAC-attenuated Salmonella conferred protection against wt Salmonella challenge . 
Mechanistic study indicated CfaAC made Salmonella outer membranes permeable , causing Salmonella to be vulnerable to host destruction . 
Thus , enhancing bacterial permeability via CfaAC represents an alternative method to attenuate pathogens despite the presence of unknown virulence factors .

Introduction
Salmonella enterica is an enteric bacterial pathogen responsible for a variety of food - and water-borne illnesses , ranging from gastro-enteritis to typhoid fever ,1 and it colonizes a wide range of animal hosts , including humans .2 Among more than 2,500 identified serovars ,3 S. typhi alone is estimated to cause approximately 16 million cases annually , resulting in 600,000 deaths worldwide ,4 with 600 of the fatalities occurring in the USA .5 S. typhimurium possesses a number of virulent determinants that facilitate its ability to colonize , invade host intestinal epithelia and spread systemically .6 Conventional attenuation methods rely on mutating known or suspect virulent genes , and in turn , these attenuated S. typhimurium strains are then used as live vaccines . 
A well-known mutant strain is the DaroA S. typhimurium that can effect protection with a single dose against wt S. typhimurium challenge .7 In the same vein , another mutant , DphoP S. typhimu-rium ,8 has been licensed for the poultry industry . 
However , the genetic inactivation strategies successfully used for Salmonella are not always adaptable to other pathogens , thus , requiring additional investigation to identify suspected virulence genes . 
CFA/I fimbria is one of the most prevalent adhesins associated with human-specific ETEC fimbriae .9 These fimbriae project from the bacterial surface to dock with specific receptors on the host cell surface within preferred niches10 to mediate small intestinal adherence and the elaboration of ( heat stable and heat labile ) enterotoxins that induce both fluid and electrolyte secretion . 
Four structural genes encode four proteins , which coordinate to form CFA/I fimbriae . 
cfaB encodes the ~ 15 kDa major subunit protein that forms the pili .11 cfaE encodes the minor subunit protein , which locates to the tip of the fimbriae and is also responsible for nucleating fiber formation .12 Adhesive phenotypes have been attributed to both the major and minor subunits of CFA/I fimbriae .13 cfaA encodes the periplasmic chaperone that promotes subunit folding and transports the subunits to an outer membrane usher where ordered assembly of the filamentous heteropolymer is achieved .12 cfaC encodes the usher believed to facilitate translocation of pilus subunits across the outer membrane .14 In the current study , we propose an alternative strategy for attenuating Gram-negative bacteria via a process we refer to as attenuating gene expression ( AGE ) , a method of heterologous gene overexpression tested with ETEC cfa/I operon . 
Inference to such a possibility has been suggested in previous work in which overexpression of cfa/I operon by an attenuated Salmonella strain alters host immune responses initially with a potent Th2 cell response to CFA/I fimbriae15 ,16 and a lack of proinflammatory cytokine production by infected macrophages .17 Such altered host

patches ( PPs ) and livers were enumerated ( Fig. 2B ) . 
The results showed no differences between P1-pY and wt strain H71 in splenic weights and tissue colonization , suggesting P1-pY is as virulent as H71 . 
Splenic weights exhibited by P1-pHC infected mice were significantly reduced relative to - pC , - pY and H71 infected mice , but splenic weights among P1-pC , - pY and H71 infected mice were not significantly different from each other . 
Importantly , P1-pHC did not colonize the spleen ( Fig. 2B ) regardless of time point examined ( Fig . 
S1 ) , a phenomenon similar to phoP and rfaC Salmonella ser Enteritidis mutants ,24 suggesting - pHC was greatly attenuated . 
PP and liver CFUs of P1-pHC infected mice were also significantly less than - pC , - pY and wt H71 infected mice by 3,000 -- 100,000-fold ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Splenic colonization by P1-pC infected mice was slightly reduced when compared with - pY or H71 infected mice , demonstrating less attenuation . 
P1-pHC confers protection against wt S. typhimurium challenge . 
To assess the virulence of these three strains , groups of BALB/c mice were orally gavaged with P1-pHC , - pC , - pY , wt H71 and DaroA S. typhimurium vaccine strain H647 .20 Only those mice given P1-pHC or H647 survived , while only one of 15 mice in the - pC administered group survived and none of the - pY or H71 infected mice survived ( Fig. 2C-1 ) . 
These results s Bioscience further demonstrate that enhanced expression of cfa/I operon attenuates Salmonella in vivo . 
Since all P1-pHC and H647 immunized mice survived , these and a group of sterile phosphate buffered saline ( sPBS ) - dosed swer or lly challe ged th t H . 
mice teraibnuwitwe71 ( Fig. 2C-2 ) . 
All sPBSdosed mice succumbed to infection within 9 d , while 60 % and 70 % of the mice dosed with P1-pHC or H647 survived , respectively . 
The percentage of survival by the mice vaccinated with the H647 was similar to that previously described .20,25 Additional studies were conducted to assess the influence of the fusion promoter used in P1-pHC . 
The P1-pHV strain was constructed and found to be as virulent as P1-pY ( Fig . 
S2 ) . 
Thus , these results show P1-pHC is capable of conferring protective immunity against wt Salmonella challenge . 
To determine if the expressed fimbriae were immunogenic in mice orally dosed with P1-pHC , H647 and sPBS , serum IgG and mucosal IgA anti-CFA/I fimbriae and anti-salmonellae endpoint antibody ( Ab ) titers were measured . 
Elevated IgG titers were induced to both CFA/I fimbriae and salmonellae when assessed 6 weeks after oral immunization with P1-pHC ( Fig. 2D ) . 
In addition , significant mucosal IgA anti-CFA/I fimbriae Abs were elicited shortly 2 weeks after oral immunization , and mucosal IgA anti-salmonellae Abs were elicited 8 -- 10 weeks post-immunization . 
As expected , strain H647 induced no anti-CFA/I immunity , but stimulated elevated anti-salmonellae immunity . 
These results show P1-pHC is able to stimulate both systemic and mucosal Abs to CFA/I fimbriae as well to the live vaccine vector . 
Expression of CfaC is essential for Salmonella attenuation . 
To determine which of the four genes in cfa/I operon was responsible for the observed attenuation , five cfa/I deletion mutants were generated ( Fig. 3A ) . 
cfaB or cfaE , or both , was deleted in-frame from pHC and referred to as pHcfaACE , pHcfaABC and pHcfaAC , respectively . 
The cfaBCE deletion and - pHcfaAC were unable to infect as robustly as - pY and , importantly , could not reproduce within macrophages . 
These results suggest either CfaB or CfaE may be dispensable for Salmonella attenuation in macrophages since their absence from - pHcfaAC resulted in attenuation . 
While the chaperone CfaA alone or the usher CfaC alone also could not induce Salmonella attenuation , the co-expression of CfaAC was essential since Salmonella attenuation was obtained for P1-pHcfaACE , - pHcfaABC or - pHcfaAC . 
In addition , co-expression of one of the structural proteins , CfaB or CfaE , may be important since colonization by appeared among the recombinant strains : mice infected with P1-pY , - pHcfaA and - pHcfaC showed enlarged spleens and elevated CFUs in spleens , PPs and livers , while the mice infected with P1-pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE and - pHcfaAC showed minimal inflammation of their spleens and low levels of salmonellae . 
Interestingly , no CFUs could be recovered from spleens of mice infected with P1-pHcfaABC , but salmonellae were recovered from PPs and livers . 
P1-pHcfaACE or - pHcfaAC appeared attenuated since between 2,500 - and 6,900-fold less salmonellae than P1-pY could be recovered from their spleens . 
These results show P1-pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE and - pHcfaAC are sig attenuated by the co-eDon of AC , ther i th icantl xpressioCfaneiontenifdy presencei or absence of the fimbrial subunits , CfaB or CfaE , and the expression of CfaC or CfaA alone is insufficient , and their virulence resembles control P1-pY . 
Subsequent to these studies , the six strains were further evaluated for their extended virulence in BALB/c mice . 
Groups of mice were orally infected with one of the six strains as previously described . 
All mice infected with P1-pHcfaABC or - pHcfaAC survived , while 90 % of - pHcfaACE infected mice survived ( Fig. 4C ) . 
In contrast , all mice infected with P1-pHcfaA , - pHcfaC or - pY succumbed to infection within 10 d . 
A second dose of P1-pHcfaABC , - pHACE or - pHcfaAC was given to the respective groups on day 42 . 
No additional attrition to vaccination was observed . 
These results further confirm that , although CfaA or CfaC alone is unable to attenuate Salmonella , the co-expression of both or in combination with a fimbrial subunit attenuates wt Salmonella , even when given at a relatively high dose . 
Analysis of the potential mechanisms involved in the Salmonella attenuation . 
The above studies illustrated that overexpression of either CFA/I fimbriae or the synergistic overexpression of CfaAC was able to inactivate the bacterial host in vitro and in vivo . 
We questioned whether the attenuation was due to the metabolic burden incurred from the expression of heterologous genes , as previously noticed .26 Thus , we compared the growth rates of the seven strains , P1-pHcfaA , - pHcfaC , - pHcfaAC , - pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE , - pHC and - pY . 
P1-pHC exhibited significantly slower growth than that of - pY , as early as 0.5 h post-inoculation , and it maintained the slowest growth rate to stationary phase among all the tested strains ( Fig . 
S3 ) . 
Since 
responses have been determined to be beneficial against auto-immune diseases , whereby the Salmonella-CFA/I vaccine stimulates diverse regulatory T cell subsets .18,19 These unconventional findings suggest heterologous gene expression of cfa/I operon is a dynamic tool that can be alternatively explored either to modulate the host immune response or to attenuate the virulence of recombinant bacteria . 
To investigate the impact of cfa/I operon overexpression upon wt pathogens , S. typhimurium H71 strain20 has been selected as a model bacterial pathogen to assess whether expression of ETEC cfa/I operon can attenuate wt Salmonella . 
The results show that indeed cfa/I operon expression attenuates wt Salmonella and is attributed primarily to the heterologous expression of the usher gene CfaC . 
This work demonstrates that it is feasible to attenuate Gram-negative bacteria using CfaC . 
Recombinant S. typhimurium H71 strains overexpressing CFA/I 
fimbriae . 
A benefit of utilizing S. typhimurium to assess the heterologous expression of fimbriae is the availability of reagents to enable2 e het rologo s ge expre and stabl0e1u2ne Lssion using a well-established approach by introducing a mutation in its asd gene ,21 e as previously shown for stable cfa/I operon expression .22 This balanced-lethal mutation eliminates possible inactivation or loss of unstable variants that could compromise analysis of the described complemented strains , requiring retention of asd-based plasmids for S. typhimurium survival . 
onse ntly , he str in DCoquentoatDasd : : kanR S. typhimurium H71 ( P1 ) was developed and transformed plasmids pHC , pC and pY ( Fig. 1A ) , respectively , to obtain the d withi recombinant strains P1-pHC , - pC and - pY . 
Expression of cfa/I operon was regulated by PtetA22 and PtetA ~ PpagC ~ PphoP23 in pC and pHC , respectively , and empty vector pY served as a control . 
Protein gel blot and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) analyses revealed the influence of the fused promoter on CFA/I fimbria expression . 
While P1-pY showed no detectable band , both - pHC and - pC showed CfaB expression ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Densitometric scanning revealed the amount of CfaB produced by P1-pHC was ~ 3.5-fold greater than that produced by the - pC strain , suggesting that fimbrial expression was enhanced by the fusion promoters when compared with the PtetA promoter alone . 
This was further confirmed by AFM that P1-pHC expressed more fimbriae than - pC strain ; no fimbriae were observed for negative control - pY ( Fig. 1C ) . 
P1-pHC and - pC are highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo . 
To investigate whether overexpression of CFA/I attenuates wt Salmonella , RAW264 .7 macrophages were infected at varying ratios with P1-pHC , - pC and - pY . 
As depicted , P1-pHC was unable to survive in macrophages , regardless of the infection dose , and these salmonellae showed as much as 1000-fold reduction by 24 h ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Compared with P1-pY , - pC showed limited replication/survival to the original infection dose . 
These results show cfa/I operon expression impedes the salmonellae survival in macrophages . 
To test whether P1-pHC is attenuated in vivo , mouse colonization studies were performed . 
At 5 d after oral administration , spleens were weighed , and bacterial CFUs in the spleens , Peyer 's

Prestained molecular weight standards are shown in Lane M. ( C ) AFM images indicate expression of CFA/I fimbriae for strains ( 1 ) P1-pHC and ( 2 ) - pC , but no fimbriae were observed for control strain ( 3 ) - pY . 
mutant was pHcfaA , and the cfaABE deletion mutant was pHcfaC . 
No fimbriae were found by AFM on the bacterial cell surface ( Fig. 3B ) , indicating that both the major fimbrial subunit gene , cfaB , and the minor fimbria subunit gene , cfaE , are required for the formation of CFA/I fimbriae . 
P1-pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE , - pHcfaAC , - pHcfaC , - pHcfaA and - pY were each evaluated for virulence in RAW264 .7 cells at a bacteria-to-macrophage infection ratio of 1:1 ( Fig. 4A ) . 
P1-pHcfaA and - pHcfaC replicated within the macrophages as vigorously as - pY at 24 h post-infection . 
However , P1-pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE 
Figure 2 . 
For figure legend , see page 33 . 
P1-pHcfaABC and - pHcfaACE was 21.1 - and 1.8-fold less than that of - pHcfaAC at 24 h , respectively . 
To assess the influence of CfaAC upon virulence in vivo , mice were orally infected with 1 109 CFUs of P1-pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE , - pHcfaAC , - pHcfaC , - pHcfaA and - pY , and tissue and colonization were analyzed at 5 d post-infection ( Fig. 4B ) . 
As with the infection of the RAW264 .7 macrophages , a segregation 
P1-pHC expressed all cfa/I components , its slow growth implies that the metabolic burden from overexpression of cfa/I operon impacts negatively upon the salmonellae , which may include the attenuation effects to the bacterial virulence . 
Growth rate s - p cfa B also howe a simil t of P1tHrAiCbsudtear.rend to - pHC , while - pHcfaA and - pHcfaC yielded slow growth rates at the stationary phase . 
However , the P1-pHcfaAC and - pHcfaACE grew as rapidly as - pY from lag to logarithmic and finally to stationary phases . 
Consequently , the metabolic burden could not account for the observed attenuation by pHcfaAC and pHcfaACE ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Thus , mechanisms other than metabolic burden might be involved in the Salmonella attenuation . 
To further identify the mechanism responsible for the coordinated attenuation conferred by CfaC and CfaA upon Salmonella ( Fig. 4 ) , we hypothesized that these two proteins interacted , possibly forming a channel , to enable secretion of CfaB and CfaE to form fimbriae , which in turn attenuated the salmonellae . 
CfaA , a periplasmic chaperone , shuttles CfaB subunits to the outer cellular membrane , while CfaC , an outer membrane usher protein , orchestrates ordered tip to base assembly of fimbriae .12 Neither of these two genes , when expressed alone , succeeded to attenuate Salmonella ; rather , their co-expression did ( Fig. 4 ) . 
To test this hypothesis , the seven strains , P1-pHcfaA , - pHcfaC , - pHcfaAC , - pHcfaABC , - pHcfaACE , - pHC and - pY , together with the low CFA/I expression strain - pC , were tested for sensitivity to erythromycin . 
This 741 Dal antibiotic does not efficiently cross the outer membrane unless there is a breach of the outer membrane integrity .27 The minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of erythromycin for strains P1-pHcfaA and - pHcfaC showed no differences when compared with control - pY ( Fig. 5A and B ) . 
However , the MICs for P1-pHcfaAC , - pHC , - pHcfaABC and - pHcfaACE were significantly lower than - pY ( p , 0.01 ) . 
These data suggested that CfaC permeability bacterial outer membranes .28 No differences in the polymyxin B MICs for any of these strains were found ( Fig. 5C ) , suggesting their outer membrane integrity remained intact after the CFA/I channel installation . 
Evaluation of protective efficacy of channel-attenuated Salmonella strains . 
To determine which combination of CfaA-and CfaC-bearing strains can act as a live vaccine , BALB/c mice were orally immunized , and those surviving vaccination were dose of vaccine and challenged 4 weeks later with wt H71 . 
One of the P1-pHcfaAC-dosed mice succumbed to vaccination , but 85.7 % of the mice ( or 75 % of the remaining mice ) survived ( Fig. 6B ) . 
As with the BALB/c mice , similar vaccine efficacy was conferred by P1-pHcfaACE in C57BL/6 mice with 80 % survival . 
P1-pHcfaABC and - pHC only achieved 50 % and 33.3 % survival , respectively . 
Collectively , these results show that making Salmonella 's outer membrane semi-permeable can attenuate its wt phenotype , and components of the cfa/I operon were valuable for conferring optimal protection in both BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice . 
Co-expression of cfaB with the usher gene dampened the protective capacity of the vaccine , possibly , because it was rapidly cleared , lessening its capacity to stimulate a protective immune response . 
Thus , these studies demonstrate it is

While initial levels of infection ( t = 0 h ) were significantly different for each strain , at 4 or 24 h post-infection , survival rates were augmented for each tested strain . 
In fact , at 4 and 24 h post-infection , P1-pHC was cleared at or below the detection limit . 
While P1-pC was not cleared as efficiently , it still was impaired relative to - pY .

The best of the tested vaccines was P1-pHcfaACE , which showed 88.9 % surival ( p , 0.001 ; Fig. 6A ) . 
The P1-pHcfaABC vaccine was the least protective of the four vaccines , only conferring 30 % protection , but was still better than sPBS-dosed control mice . 
This poor performance may be in part explained by its rapid clearance , which may impair its ability to stimulate protective immunity . 
While the co-expression of CfaA and CfaC by P1-pHcfaAC showed reduced efficacy by conferring only 60 % protection , much like - pHC , the co-expression of CfaE may be important to enhance protective capacity of this vaccine . 
A second study was conducted to determine the efficacy of these live vaccines in C57BL/6 mice .

Discussion
and Th2 cells to the expressed fimbriae15 and salmonellae25 and dampening macrophage inflammatory responses .17 In addition to these findings , the evidence presented here suggests that interfering with salmonellae permeability to their environment by cfa/I operon can promote their clearance and thus could possibly be used as a general strategy for vaccine development . 
As such , the data showed that varying the expression of cfa/I components impacts the level of attenuation upon wt Salmonella . 
Simply expressing the CFA/I fimbriae was insufficient , as evidenced by the P1-pC that remained virulent in macrophages and in mice . 
Thus , to enhance the expression of cfa/I operon , a strategy commonly used for eukaryotic promoters was adopted , whereby three different prokaryotic promoters were fused in order to enhance transcription and ultimately the amount of fimbrial proteins produced in the Salmonella host . 
The introduction of a tripartite promoter to enhance cfa/I operon expression succeeded , as evidenced by the enhanced production of CfaB by P1-pHC , its attenuation in macrophages and its ability to serve as a vaccine for salmonellosis . 
Such an approach in itself is novel and significantly augmented AGE to attenuate Salmonella . 
s whic o the g nes i the cfa I ope nc To learnBhifoesnci/eron were relevant to the observed Salmonella attenuation , subsequent studiese developed additional strains to test if individual genes or their combination were important for the observed attenuation . 
Since CfaC was identified as an usher protein12 ,14 to allow exportation of the fimbrial gene products , CfaB encoding the major subunit and CfaE , encoding the tip protein , we hypothesized that CfaC weakens the structural integrity of the Salmonella membranes as stribute . 
other chaperone-usher combinations do for pilus assembly .33,34 As such , usher proteins typically facilitate pilus subunit translocation outside the outer membrane ,33 and in the case of uropathogenic E. coli , its PapC usher can form a pore in the outer membrane .33,34 Whether or not CfaC can form a similar pore is unclear , but it does mediate the ordered translocation of fimbrial subunits , as 12 evident with other ETEC . 
Thus , it was anticipated the expression of CfaC alone would be sufficient to attenuate Salmonella , but this was found not to be the case , as P1-pHcfaC retained its virulence in macrophages and mice . 
Moreover , it was resistant to erythromycin treatment , suggesting that simply expressing CfaC is insufficient for permeabilization . 
In fact , co-expression with CfaA by the P1-pHcfaAC strain was required for susceptibility to erythromycin treatment and loss of virulence in macrophages and in mice , which suggests usher CfaC transporting to and installing in cell outer membrane require chaperone CfaA or at least possible activation of CfaC by CfaA . 
Since CfaC usher is able to facilitate the secretion of large protein molecules CfaB and CfaE for fimbria formation , it is justified to conclude that excessive CfaC expression may facilitate small molecule entry to or exit from the cell freely , much like a channel or pore , as suggested by the erythromycin sensitivity studies . 
However , CfaC is presumed to be a dedicated channel for CFA/I fimbrial assembly and perhaps erythromycin can use CfaC to facilitate its entry into salmonellae . 
Alternatively , at present , it is unclear whether expression of CfaC alters the outer membrane integrity , thus , enabling the enhanced sensitivity ( uptake ) of erythromycin . 
However , from inclusion of CfaB was less effective in stimulating protective immunity against Salmonella , it was , however , very potent when combined with CfaA and CfaC in attenuating Salmonella , which implicates its possible use for other pathogens . 
As such , the combination effective for eliciting protective immunity to Salmonella may not be the same combination of cfa/I genes needed to attenuate other pathogens . 
These findings complement those of a previous study of overexpressing a Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-shock protein found also to attenuate the bacilli , favoring enhanced immune stimulation and inducing IFN-c-producing CD8 + T cells .36 In summary , these studies suggest AGE or overexpression of chaperones and/or usher proteins may provide an alternative to attenuate virulent pathogens , either by making the pathogen more permeable to host environmental stresses or by enhancing the pathogen 's immunogenicity . 
Overexpression of CfaA , CfaC and CfaE represented the best combination of cfa/I to attenuate Salmonella , allowing it to be used as a live vaccine for salmonellosis . 
Although co-expression of CfaA , CfaB and CfaE or the entire cfa/I operon exhibited the strongest attenuation upon Salmonella , such attenuation resulted in its rapid clearance from the host disallowing optimal immunization . 
From this study , we expect other related heterologous proteins , such as porins and s Bioscience appendage structures , may also exert similar attenuating capacity upon Gram-negative bacteria . 
Although heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins are the major virulence factors of ETEC responsible for diarrhea in infected hosts ,29 CFA/I fimbriae aid in the initial infection to promote ETEC adherence to host intestinal epithelium ,30 thus allowing elicitation of the toxins in close proximity to the intestinal epithelium .30 In fact , Abs induced to CFA/I fimbriae are protective against ETEC .29,31,32 To enable vaccination , overexpression of CFA/I fimbriae by an attenuated Salmonella vaccine vector elicits elevated mucosal and systemic Abs to the fimbriae and also alters host recognition of the salmonellae by stimulating both Th1 
the sensitivity study with another antibiotic polymyxin B , it was evident that the salmonellae outer membrane was not disrupted due to the co-expression of CfaAC , suggesting the outer membrane integrity remains intact . 
Hence , the enhanced permeability to erythromycin by the channeled strains may result from erythromycin 's use of the expressed channels to facilitate entry into the salmonellae . 
Regardless , co-expression of CfaAC clearly enhances the permeability of the salmonellae to erythro-mycin , which is in agreement with the previous observation that overexpression of curli or fimbriae can cause the bacteria to be more sensitive to erythromycin .27 Studies are currently being pursued to further investigate this issue . 
As a vaccine , P1-pHcfaAC was able to confer protection against wt Salmonella challenge for both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice . 
For BALB/c mice , it was as protective as P1-pHC was for C57BL/6 mice and it was capable of conferring 83.7 % survival as our best construct , P1-pHcfaACE . 
In fact , P1-pHcfaACE also conferred the best protection against wt Salmonella challenge for 88.9 % survival by the vaccinated BALB/c mice . 
These data show the inclusion of CfaE is important for optimal protection . 
CFA/I fimbriae 2 s a emag lutini Land act a0h1g2n in which CfaB displays glycosphingolipid-binding capacity , and CfaE contributes toe erythrocyte binding and is important for orchestrating the polymerization of the pilus .12,35 How the inclusion of CfaE in P1-pHcfaACE is important for protection against wt Salmonella challenge is unclear , although 88.9 % of the challenged mice survived , unlike the mice va cinate ith t inta t cf opero Dcod wnheocta/I dn - pHC or with - pHcfaAC , which showed a reduced efficacy . 
Thei inclusion of CfaB with CfaA and CfaC greatly attenuated Salmonella ( P1-pHcfaABC ) , but because of such attenuation , its ability to protect was less than ideal , as evidenced by the reduced efficacy ( # 50 % ) in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice . 
Furthermore , since P1-pHC conferred a similar protection as the conventional vaccine H647 , this evidence suggests the described AGE method for generating live attenuated vaccines by overexpression of chaperone and usher proteins is as efficient as conventional virulence mutagenesis strategies involving the deletion of virulence genes . 
Conventional methods to develop live vaccines often require prior knowledge of virulence factors . 
A significant attribute of the described study is the potential to express foreign antigens to attenuate Gram-negative pathogens . 
Simply expressing the cfa/I operon , as done for P1-pC , was found to be insufficient by wt Salmonella despite fimbria formation . 
Instead , elevated expression was achieved by utilizing the tripartite promoter to enhance expression of cfa/I genes as a potential vaccine candidate for salmonellosis . 
The P1-pHC could not colonize the mouse spleen nor could - pHcfaABC , a phenomenon only previously observed with two Salmonella ser Enteritidis mutants ,24 the phoP and rfaC , at a dose of 1 104 CFUs . 
However , in our study , neither P1-pHC nor - pHcfaABC could colonize mouse spleens when mice were orally dosed with 1 109 CFUs . 
Instead , these results show that overexpression of cfa/I machinery to export fimbrial subunits represents a feasible alternative to conventional attenuation methods and perhaps requires the inclusion of the CfaE fimbrial subunit for optimal attenuation of Salmonella .

Mouse care and study . 
This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and complied with the Animal Welfare Act and all other applicable federal , state and local laws . 
All animal care and procedures were approved by the Montana State University ( MSU ) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . 
Pathogenfree female BALB/c and C57BL/6N mice ( National Cancer Institute , Frederick Cancer Research Facility ) 7 -- 9 weeks of age were used throughout this study . 
All mice were maintained at MSU Animal Resource Center under pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated cages under HEPA-filtered barrier conditions and were fed sterile food and water ad libitum . 
Bacterial strains , plasmids , media , genetic manipulation and protein gel blot . 
The bacterial strains , plasmids and their relevant characteristics are provided in Table S1 . 
E. coli strain S17 -- 1 ( lpir ) was used for replicating R6K original vector pCVD442 and its derivative plasmids when preparing the suicide plasmid for Salmonella . 
The P1 ( Dasd : : kanR S. typhimurium H71 ) mutant was derived from wt strain H71 . 
Strains containing plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Lysogeny broth ( LB ; 10 g of tryptone , 10 g of NaCl and 5 g of yeast extract/L ) with appropriate antibiotics , if needed . 
For S. typhimurium asd mutant construction , ampicillin ( 100 mg/ml ) and kanamycin ( 10 mg/ml ) were used for mutant selection . 
Diaminopimelic acid ( DAP ) ( 50 mg/ml ) was used for E. coli H68122 or S. typhimurium H71 culture unless a plasmid containing asd was introduced . 
Bacteria were cultured in LB and stored at -80 °C in LB plus 20 % glycerol . 
Experimental Procedures stribute . 
Transformants were selected on LB agar containing 10 mg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C overnight . 
A single colony was picked and grown to late logarithmic phase in LB with 50 mg/ml DAP . 
A series of dilutions was plated on LB agar containing no NaCl , but 5 % sucrose and 50 mg/ml DAP . 
Sucrose-resistant colonies were tested for loss of asd by both kanamycin resistance testing and the obligated requirement for DAP . 
Those colonies that did not grow without DAP , but were resistant to kanamycin , were thereby asd mutants . 
A total of three of these asd mutants were obtained . 
One clone was further analyzed by sequencing to confirm its asd inner sequence was replaced by kanR . 
To enhance cfa/I operon expression , the macrophage inducible promoters , PphoP and PpagC , were fused with promoter PtetA from plasmid pC ( Table S1 ) and installed upstream of the cfa/I operon , as follows : The 274 bp promoter PpagC was amplified from template H71 genomic DNA by PCR with a pair of primers , pagC-F/pagC-R ( Table S1 ) and was inserted between PphoP and PtetA in plasmid pV55 .39 This construct was termed pV6 ( Table S1 ) . 
Then cfa/I operon from pC ( Table S1 ) was used to replace lcrV in pV6 . 
The new plasmid in which the cfa/I operon was controlled by fused promoter , PtetA ~ PpagC ~ PphoP , was termed pHC . 
s Bioscience Construction of CFA/I non-fimbriae genes cfaA and cfaC expression plasmids . 
To determine if the non-fimbriae genes cfaA and cfaC were involved in the Salmonella attenuation , the inner DNA fragment sequences of the cfaB encoding fimbrial major subunit and cfaE encoding fimbrial minor subunit from plasmid pHC were in-frame deleted or completely removed , respectively . 
stribute . 
The primers used for cfaB and cfaE deletion were cfaA1-F/cfaB-R and cfaE-F/cfaE-R , respectively ( Table S2 ) . 
After deletion , the upstream sequence of cfaB had 21 bp and downstream had 63 bp left , which were confirmed by sequencing . 
This cfaB in-frame deletion plasmid derived from pHC was named pHcfaACE . 
The cfaE was completely deleted from the pHC , and the new plasmid was named pHcfaABC . 
The double mutant of cfaBE was derived from pHcfaABC , whereby both cfaA and cfaC expression were under the regulation of fusion promoter . 
This mutant was termed pHcfaAC . 
The plasmid pHV was generated by digesting pHC with SacI and XhoI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligated . 
Thus , pHV harbors PtetA ~ PpagC ~ PphoP fusion promoter , but not the cfa/I component . 
Plasmid pY containing only asd with its replication origin was derived from pC by digesting pC with ScaI and then self-ligated . 
To determine the involvement of chaperone gene cfaA in the Salmonella attenuation , cfaA was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers of cfaA2-F/cfaA-R ( Table S2 ) and cloned downstream of the fusion promoter of pHC . 
Thus , cfaABCE in pHC was replaced by cfaA . 
After sequencing confirmation , this new plasmid was named pHcfaA . 
To determine the involvement of the usher gene cfaC in the Salmonella attenuation , the pHcfaAC were digested by BamHI and SacI to remove the upstream genes cfaA and in-framed deleted cfaB , and the sticky ends were filled by T4 DNA polymerase and were self-ligated . 
This plasmid was termed pHcfaC .

Wild-type H71 strain was used as source of HKST inactivated by incubating live cells at 100 °C for 15 min and absence of cell growth was confirmed on LB agar . 
Fecal pellets were collected from individual mice and solubilized in 50 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in sPBS ( 10 % v/w ) by continual vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C . 
After microcentrifugation , supernatants were frozen until assayed .
