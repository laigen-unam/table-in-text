ABSTRACT 
Previous work by the present authors indicated a murein lipoprotein mutant of Salmonella shows a marked down-regulation in expression of yqhC . 
Because YqhC is a putative DNA-binding protein , it is likely involved in modulation of Salmonella genes . 
Deletion of yqhC renders Salmonella defective in invasion of intestinal epithelial cells , motility , and induction of cytotoxicity . 
In the present study , further attenuation in induction of inﬂammatory cytokines/chemokines and histopathological lesions was seen in mice infected with the yqhC mutant . 
On the other hand , deletion of yqhC did not signiﬁcantly affect the LD50 in mice or the ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate in vivo . 
To better understand how YqhC affects Salmonella virulence and to identify factors potentially modulated by YqhC , comparative transcriptome and proteome analysis of the yqhC mutant and the WT Salmonella was performed . 
Data from these experiments indicate that deletion of yqhC signiﬁcantly alters the transcription of several genes associated with the SPI-1 encoded T3SS and ﬂagellar regulons , correlating with the yqhC mutant phenotype . 
Overall , this study indicates that deletion of the yqhC gene causes a number of virulence-related defects in vitro , but has a modest effect in vivo , despite affecting induction of inﬂammatory cytokines and histopathology . 
Key words mouse model of infection , Salmonella pathogenesis , YqhC mutant . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , which is frequently implicated in enteric disease outbreaks due to consumption of contaminated food , is a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality ( 1 ) . 
The frequency with which Salmonella is present in beef and poultry products and , as shown more recently , in vegetables , highlights the importance of this organism in human health ( 2 -- 4 ) . 
In the USA , the prevalence of salmonellosis has been estimated to range from 80,000 to 3,700,000 cases annually ( 5 , 6 ) . 
Salmonella pathogenesis depends on the ability of the bacteria to bind and invade host intestinal tissue ( 7 ) . 
Following binding , Salmonella invade host intestinal epithelial cells , translocate through M cells , and are taken up by macrophages ( 8 ) , where they survive and replicate , producing cytotoxicity and cell death that is induced by caspase-1 activated by sipB ( 9 ) . 
Interaction of Salmonella with host cells induces expression of a wide variety of proinﬂammatory cytokines , such as TNF-α , IL-1β , IL-6 and γ interferon , and chemokines , such as IL-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and

RANTES , which mediate host responses and tissue damage ( 10 -- 12 ) . 
Chemokines are produced by epithelial cells and attract neutrophils , macrophages , and T cells to the site of inﬂammation ( 10 ) . 
Proinﬂammatory cytokines are essential for successful host defense against Salmonella . 
Our previous microarray analysis of an attenuated lpp gene mutant in S. Typhimurium showed a marked reduction in the transcription of the yqhC gene ( 13 ) , strongly suggesting that YqhC plays a role in the attenuation . 
YqhC has been identiﬁed by DNA and amino acid sequence analysis as a putative DNA binding protein belonging to the AraC/XylS family of bacterial transcriptional regulators ( 13 ) . 
In this study , to understand the role of YqhC in Salmonella virulence , we constructed a S. Typhimurium strain in which the yqhC gene had been deleted . 
Virulence potential in the yqhC mutant was tested both in vitro , using a cell culture system , and in vivo , using a mouse model of infection . 
Further , transcriptional and proteomic analysis of the yqhC mutant , compared to the WT strain , revealed several genes and proteins that are differentially expressed and therefore potentially regulated by YqhC . 
This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the role of YqhC in modulation of S. Typhimurium virulence genes . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, cells, and plasmids
A list of bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is provided in Table 1 . 
Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium strain 14028 was obtained from the ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA . ) 
and a spontaneous nalidixic acid resistance strain of Salmonella was generated in our laboratory . 
The E. coli ( 14 ) and Salmonella strains were grown either in LB medium or on SS agar plates . 
Ampicillin ( 100 μg / mL ) , tetracycline ( 15 μg / mL ) , kanamycin ( 50 μg / mL ) , and nalidixic acid ( 100 μg / mL ) were added to the media as necessary . 
RAW264 .7 murine macrophage and T84 human intestinal epithelial cell lines were obtained from ATCC . 
RAW264 .7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10 % FBS ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 
T84 cells were grown and maintained in DMEM/F -12 medium with 10 % FBS . 
Both types of cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO2 . 
Construction of Salmonella yqhC mutant
A yqhC knockout mutant was generated by homologous recombination using the suicide vector pDMS197 . 
Brieﬂy , the 5 ′ - and 3 ′ - ﬂanking DNA sequences to yqhC were ampliﬁed from the chromosomal DNA of WT S. Typhimurium by PCR , using primer sets F1/R1 , with KpnI and SalI restriction sites , and F2/R2 , with SalI and XbaI restriction sites ( Table 2 ) . 
The ﬂanking DNA sequences were cloned into a pBluescript vector at the KpnI/XbaI sites to create the recombinant plasmid pBlueyqh . 
Subsequently , a Kmr gene cassette ( obtained from the plasmid pUC4K ) was inserted into the SalI restriction site to generate the plasmid pBlueyqhK . 
The plasmid pBlueyqhK was digested with the KpnI/XbaI restriction enzymes and ligated into the suicide vector pDMS197 to produce

pDMSyqhK , which was transformed into E.coli SM10 . 
The recombinant E. coli carrying pDMSyqhK was conjugated with Nalr S. Typhimurium . 
The Nalr , Kmr , and sucrose resistant transconjugates were selected as candidates for yqhC knockout mutants of S. Typhimurium . 
The doublecrossover mutants were identiﬁed as Salmonella by growth on SS agar media , thus differentiating them from the E. coli used for conjugation . 
To conﬁrm deletion of the yqhC gene from the chromosome of S. Typhimurium , the selected yqhC mutants and WT S. Typhimurium were subjected to DNA sequencing and PCR analysis , using primer sets on the Kmr resistance gene and the yqhC ﬂanking sequences ( Table 2 ) . 
The primer sets F/R1 and F2 / R2 were used to amplify the up-and downstream yqhC ﬂanking sequence , K3 / K5 primers to amplify the Kmr cassette , and F1/K5 and K3/R2 to amplify the combined up and downstream ﬂanking sequence and the Kmr cassette . 
DNA from the WT S. Typhimurium was also used as a control . 
The yqhC knockout mutant was then complemented . 
A DNA fragment containing the yqhC gene from WT S. Typhimurium was PCR ampliﬁed using primer set F3B / R3B and blunt-ended using a PCR polishing kit ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) and ligated into the blunt-ended ScaI restriction enzyme digested pBR322 vector . 
The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into the yqhC knockout mutant by electroporation . 
Growth curve analysis
Overnight cultures of the WT , yqhC mutant , and complemented strain were washed twice in PBS and inoculated into 15 mL of LB , LB pH 5.0 , LB + 340 mM NaCl , and DMEM/F12 + 5 % FBS and incubated at 37 ◦ C with shaking at 225 rpm . 
OD600 values were taken every hour over an 8 hour period . 
Culture media LB pH 5.0 and 
LB + 340 mM NaCl represented acidic and osmotic stress conditions , respectively . 
Adhesion assay
The adhesion assay was performed as previously described ( 15 ) . 
Approximately 5 × 105 T84 intestinal epithelial cells/well were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO2 . 
Cells were infected with yqhC mutant , WT and the complemented S. Typhimurium strains ( grown to an OD of 0.4 to 0.5 ) at a MOI of 10:1 and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 1 hr . 
The unbound bacteria were aspirated , the cells washed six times with PBS and lysed with 0.1 % TX-100 , and various dilutions of the cell lysates plated onto SS agar plates to determine the numbers of bound bacteria . 
Invasion assay
The assay was performed following a previously described method ( 16 ) . 
Brieﬂy , cells were seeded and infected as described for the adhesion assay . 
Following infection and ◦ 1 hr of incubation at 37 C , the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37 ◦ C for an additional hour with gentamicin-containing medium ( 100 μg / mL ) to kill any extracellular bacteria . 
Following incubation , the gentamicin-containing medium was removed , the cells washed six times with PBS and then lysed with 0.1 % TX-100 . 
Next , various dilutions of the cell lysates were plated onto SS agar plates to determine the numbers of internalized bacteria . 
Cytotoxicity and cell death
The cytotoxicity of various Salmonella strains was assessed by employing the CytoTox 96 LDH assay kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) to measure release of LDH enzyme from the host cells . 
RAW264 .7 cells were seeded into

96-well tissue culture plates ( 1 × 105 cells/well ) and incubated overnight at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO2 . 
The cells were infected with various Salmonella strains at an MOI of 10:1 and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 5 hr . 
After incubation , culture supernatants were examined for the release of LDH according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
LDH percentage release was calculated as : ( experimental re - − lease minimal release ) / ( maximum release − minimum × release ) 100 . 
Motility assay
Luria-Bertani semisolid medium with 0.35 % agar was used to characterize the motility phenotype of the yqhC mutant . 
Equal numbers of CFU ( 1 × 106 ) of the yqhC mutant , WT , and the complemented strain of S. Typhimurium were stabbed into 0.35 % LB agar . 
The plates were incubated at 37 ◦ C overnight and the motility assayed by examining the migration of bacteria through the agar from the inoculation site towards the periphery of the plate . 
Mouse experiments
Eight-week old female Swiss-Webster mice ( Harlan Laboratories , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) were used for the study . 
For the LD50 experiment , the mice were divided into six groups ( three for WT , three for YqhC , n = 10 in each ) , inoculated by the i.p. or oral route with various doses ( 1 × 104 -- 1 × 106 CFU ) of either yqhC mutant or WT and observed for mortality for 1 month . 
To assess systemic bacterial survival and replication , cytokine production and histopathological ﬁndings , the mice were divided into three groups ( n = 10 ) and inoculated via the i.p. route ( 1 × 104 CFU ) with the yqhC mutant , WT strain or PBS ( control ) . 
Five mice from each group were bled for sera and killed at 1 and 3 days post infection . 
Their livers and spleens were removed , weighed and examined to determine bacterial survival . 
Portions of these livers and spleens were also preserved in 10 % buffered formalin for histopathological examination . 
Aliquots ( 0.1 g ) of the livers and spleens were homogenized in 1 mL of PBS , serially diluted and plated on SS agar . 
The total bacterial loads in livers and spleens were determined from the resulting colony counts . 
Cytokine and chemokine production was assessed by measuring their serum concentrations ; these assays were performed by Quansys Biosciences ( Logan , UT , USA ) . 
The histopathological samples were processed and stained with H&E at the University of Wisconsin histology core facility . 
Histopathological examination was performed by a pathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups . 
Grading was based on a 5-tiered grading system , 0 being histologically normal , and 4 having the most severe inﬂammatory and degenerative lesions . 
RNA-Seq analysis
Mid-exponential phase bacterial cultures ( O.D. of 0.6 ) 600 of WT and the yqhC mutant were grown in LB medium . 
Total bacterial RNA was extracted and treated with dexoyribonuclease using the RiboPure-Bacteria RNA isolation kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Ribosomal RNA was removed using a MICROBExpress Bacterial mRNA Pu-riﬁcation Kit ( Ambion ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Subsequent processing , including RNA fragmentation , creation of a cDNA library , and highthroughput cDNA sequencing was performed at the UWBC using a Illumina Genome Analyzer II ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 
The resulting sequence reads were aligned with the reference Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 genome sequence and used to generate a base-resolution expression proﬁle for each gene . 
Reads from replicate samples were pooled , and the number of reads per gene normalized according to the total number of reads in each library and the gene size using CLC Genomics Workbench Version 3.7 ( CLC Bio , Cambridge , MA , USA ) . 
Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
RNA was extracted from mid-exponential phase bacterial cultures of WT and yqhC mutant as described above . 
Realtime RT-PCR was performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) and a DNA Engine Opticon2 Real-Time cycler ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 
Primers used in the real-time RT-PCR ampliﬁcations are listed in Table 3 . 
Initial cycles at 50 ◦ C for 30 min and 95 ◦ C for 15 min were followed by 40 cycles of 94 ◦ C for 15 sec , 55 ◦ C for 30 sec , and 72 ◦ C for 30 sec and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 ◦ C for 7 min . 
In order to obtain fold change values , Ct values were calculated and the data analyzed using the 2 − Ct as described by Livak and Schmittgen ( 17 ) . 
Proteome analysis
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by Kendrick Labs ( Madison , WI , USA ) using the carrier Ampholine ( GE Healthcare , Waukesha , WI , USA ) method of isoelectric focusing . 
Brieﬂy , S. Typhimurium ( WT and mutant ) were cultured in LB medium to mid-exponential phase , pelleted by centrifugation , washed three times with PBS and treated with cell lysis buffer ( Kendrick Labs ) . 
Isoelectric focusing was carried out in glass tubes using 1 % pH 4 -- 6 Servalyt ( Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) and 1 % pH 5 -- 8 ampholines ( GE Healthcare ) for 9600 volt-hrs . 
After achieving equilibrium with SDS sample buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 50 mM dithiothreitol , 2.3 % SDS and 0.0625 M tris , pH 6.8 ) , each tube gel was sealed to the top of a stacking gel and separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . 
The gels were silver stained and dried between cellophane sheets . 
Duplicate gels were run for each sample ( WT and mutant ) . 
Gels were scanned with a laser densitometer ( Model PDSI , Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) and the images analyzed using Progenesis Same Spots software ( version 3.2 , Nonlinear Dynamics ) and Progenesis PG240 software ( version 2006 , Nonlinear Dynamics ) . 
Protein spots were identiﬁed by using MALDI-TOF/MS analysis , which was performed at the UWBC . 
Brieﬂy , second dimension separated protein spots were excised , in-gel digested and peptide Map Fingerprint result-dependent MS/MS analysis performed on a MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectrometer . 
Raw data was deconvoluted using GPS Explorer software and submitted for peptide mapping and MS/MS ion search analysis against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database with an in-house licensed Mascot search engine . 
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) and Student 's t-test . 
Data were considered signiﬁcant if the P value was ≤ 0.05 . 
Unless otherwise speciﬁed , experiments were repeated three times and data expressed as arithmetic means with standard deviations . 
RESULTS
Analysis of the yqhC mutant
PCR analysis conﬁrmed the deletion of yqhC and insertion of the Kmr gene cassette . 
Sequencing of the yqhC mutant showed the presence of the Kmr cassette and the absence of the yqhC gene , conﬁrming replacement of yqhC by the Kmr gene cassette . 
Subsequently , growth characteristics of the YqhC mutant were determined under different growth conditions . 
Growth curve analysis of the yqhC mutant in LB , LB pH 5.0 , LB + 340 mM NaCl , and DMEM/F12 + 5 % FBS revealed no signiﬁcant change in the growth characteristics of the yqhC mutant compared to the WT and complemented strains ( data not shown ) , indicating that deletion of the yqhC gene does not have an effect on Salmonella growth . 
Deletion of yqhC attenuates virulence in vitro
Infection of T84 cells with the yqhC mutant revealed the invasive ability of the yqhC mutant was reduced about 1000-fold compared to that of WT S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 1 ) ; however binding of the yqhC mutant to T84 cells was not affected ( data not shown ) . 
This indicates that deletion of yqhC results in S. Typhimurium being defective in regard to invasion of epithelial cells . 
The invasive ability of the mutant was restored by complementation of the yqhC gene , indicating that yqhC plays a role in the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells in S. Typhimurium . 
To test the ability of the yqhC mutant to cause cytotoxicity in RAW264 .7 macrophage cells , we performed an LDH release assay . 
As compared to cells infected with WT and complemented strains , the yqhC knockout mutant caused minimal release of LDH from macrophage cells ( Fig. 2 ) , signifying that deletion of the yqhC gene reduces the ability of S. Typhimurium to induce cytotoxicity in macrophages . 
A motility assay was performed to test whether deletion of yqhC has an effect on Salmonella motility . 
The yqhC mutant migrated a signiﬁcantly shorter distance ( 21 mm ) than WT ( 45 mm ) and complemented strains ( 42 mm ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These data indicate that deletion of yqhC signiﬁcantly affects S. Typhimurium motility .

Decreased virulence of yqhC mutant in mice
To investigate whether deletion of the yqhC gene alters the virulence properties of S. Typhimurium in vivo , we used a murine model of infection . 
An LD50 study using i.p. and oral routes showed that the yqhC mutant induces a similar mortality pattern to that of the WT , indicating that deletion of yqhC does not signiﬁcantly affect the LD50 in mice infected via the i.p. route ( data not shown ) . 
We examined the effect of YqhC in systemic infection in mice . 
Determination of bacterial load showed that the bacterial count in mice infected with the WT increased from 3.6 logs to 5.2 logs in the liver ( Fig. 4a ) and 4.0 logs to 6.3 logs in the spleen ( Fig. 4b ) over a 3 day period . 
In strains . 
Bacteria were stabbed into 0.35 % LB agar . 
After overnight incubation , migration of the bacteria through the agar from the inoculation site was measured . 
The asterisk denotes statistically signiﬁcant difference between the WT and the yqhC mutant ( P < 0.0001 ) , and between the yqhC mutant and the complemented strain ( P < 0.0001 ) . 
contrast , bacterial counts in mice infected with the yqhC mutant increased from 2.0 logs to 5.0 logs in the liver and 2.9 logs to 5.7 logs in the spleen over a 3 day period ( Fig. 4a , b ) . 
Although there was a signiﬁcant difference in bacterial load on day 1 because of a defect in invasion , the rates of replication for the yqhC mutant and the WT were similar from days 1 to 3 post-infection . 
On days 1 and 3 post-infection we assayed 16 cytokines and chemokines in the sera of mice infected with the yqhC mutant and WT S. Typhimurium . 
Deletion of yqhC gene signiﬁcantly reduced the concentrations of TNF-α , IL-6 , and KC ( equivalent of IL-8 ) ( Fig. 5a -- c ) in the sera of mice infected with the yqhC mutant , compared to those in mice infected with the WT . 
At day 1 post-infection , both sera from mice infected with WT S. Typhimurium and the yqhC mutant showed similar concentrations of TNF-α ( 12.2 and 13.6 pg/mL , respectively ) . 
However , in the sera of mice inoculated with WT S. Typhimurium , an increase in the production of TNF-α was observed at day 3 , with concentrations reaching 44 pg/mL ; whereas in the sera of mice infected with the yqhC mutant , TNF-α concentrations dropped to 0.7 pg/mL ( Fig. 5a ) . 
Similarly , concentrations of KC in sera were comparable in both strains ( 34.6 in the WT and 29.4 pg/mL in the yqhC mutant ) at day 1 . 
On day 3 , KC concentrations in the sera of mice infected with WT S. Typhimurium increased to 620 pg/mL . 
In contrast , KC concentrations in the sera of mice infected with the mutant increased to 380 pg/mL on day 3 , indicating a 39 % reduction in the concentration of KC in mice infected with the mutant as compared to mice infected with the WT strain ( Fig. 5b ) . 
Likewise , on day 1 concentrations of IL-6 were 57 pg/mL and 23 pg/mL in the sera of mice infected with the yqhC mutant of mice infected with 1 × 104 CFU of the yqhC mutant ( YqhC ) and WT . 
Aliquots ( 0.1 g ) of liver and spleen were homogenized in PBS , serially diluted , and plated on SS agar to determine the bacterial load . 
Increase in bacterial load on day 3 compared to day 1 was statistically signiﬁcant for both the yqhC and WT . 
Asterisks denote statistical signiﬁcant differences between YqhC and the WT in ( a ) the liver ( P = 0.0216 ) and ( b ) spleen ( P = 0.00242 ) on day 1 . 
and WT S. Typhimurium , respectively . 
On day 3 serum IL-6 concentrations were 460 pg/mL in mice infected with the yqhC mutant , compared to 826 pg/mL in mice infected with WT S. Typhimurium , indicating a 44 % reduction in IL-6 concentrations on day 3 in mice infected with the yqhC mutant ( Fig. 5c ) . 
Based on these data , deletion of yqhC signiﬁcantly affects induction of TNF-α , IL-6 , and KC ( IL-8 ) in mice . 
Histopathological examination of the liver and spleen of mice infected with the WT , yqhC , and non-infected control was performed using a 5-tier grading system . 
Livers of mice infected with the WT indicated severe inﬂammatory and degenerative changes with signiﬁcant tissue necrosis and marked inﬁltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells ( grade 4 , Fig. 6 , panels a and b ) . 
Similarly , a marked inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and signiﬁcant tissue necrosis was observed in the spleens of mice infected with the WT ( grade 4 , Fig. 6 , panels c and d ) . 
In contrast , there was moderate inﬁltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells along with mild to moderate necrosis in the livers of mice infected with the yqhC mutant ( grade 3 , Fig. 6 , panels a and b ) . 
Likewise , spleens of mice infected with the yqhC mutant had moderate inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells with tissue necrosis ( grade 3 , Fig. 6 , panels c and d ) . 
Livers and spleens of non-infected control mice were histologically normal ( grade 0 ) . 
The above in vitro and in vivo data indicate that deletion of yqhC signiﬁcantly affects virulence ; including invasion , cytotoxicity , motility and host inﬂammatory and cytokine and chemokine responses , suggesting that yqhC modulates S. Typhimurium virulence . 
Therefore , to identify bacterial factors potentially modulated by YqhC we performed transcriptome and proteome analysis on the yqhC mutant and the WT .

Transcriptome analysis of yqhC mutant
Transcriptome studies were performed using RNA-seq analysis of the yqhC mutant in order to analyze the differential gene expression of the yqhC mutant compared to WT S. Typhimurium . 
Determination of differentially expressed genes indicates genes potentially modulated ( directly or indirectly ) by YqhC . 
The RNA-seq experiment indicated 1076 genes showed signiﬁcant changes ( P ≤ 0.05 ) in expression in the yqhC mutant as compared to the WT . 
Of these genes , 283 were down-regulated and 793 upregulated in the yqhC mutant . 
The down-regulated genes included 32 related to invasion and SPI-1 encoded T3SS . 
Among these were T3SS regulatory genes ( hilA , hilD , invF ) , T3SS apparatus genes ( invHGBC , spaQR , prgHIJK , orgA ) , and effector proteins ( sipABCD , sicA ) . 
In addition , ﬂagellar regulatory genes ( ﬂjB , ﬂjA ) and genes relating to nitrogen metabolism ( napDGA , narKGXJ ) were also shown to be down-regulated . 
The upregulated genes included those involved in metabolic processes ( astADB ) , oxidation/reduction ( fadE , dkgA , yjgB ) , and transmembrane transport ( gudT , gabP ) . 
Down-regulation in invasion associated genes , T3SS effector genes , and ﬂagellar genes correlated with the yqhC phenotype ( deﬁcient spleens of mice infected with WT , yqhC mutant and non-infected controls .

On the other hand , SPI-2 genes were not significantly altered in the yqhC mutant , indicating that deletion of yqhC does not affect expression of SPI-2 .

Proteome analysis
This assay was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the yqhC mutant potentially modulated by YqhC . 
Differential protein analysis indicated that expression of 37 total proteins was altered in the yqhC mutant compared to the WT . 
Expression of 24 proteins was down-regulated and 13 upregulated in the yqhC mutant . 
Of these altered proteins , 10 were identiﬁed by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis . 
The identiﬁed proteins included SipA , Lon , and GroEL , which are related to virulence and pathogenesis , as well as metabolic proteins and some of unknown function . 
SipA , a secreted effector protein encoded in SPI-1 that binds actin and mediates invasion by promoting actin polymerization ( 18 ) was down-regulated significantly in the yqhC mutant . 
GroEL , a chaperonin protein that promotes folding of proteins under stressful conditions ( 19 ) , and Lon , a protease that degrades SPI-1 regulators HilC and HilD ( 20 ) , were upregulated in the mutant . 
The differential expression of SipA , Lon , and GroEL identiﬁed by proteome analysis conﬁrmed our ﬁndings using RNA-seq and real-time RT-PCR . 
DISCUSSION
In this study , for the ﬁrst time , we have characterized the role of putative transcriptional regulator YqhC in modulation of virulence in S. Typhimurium using in vitro and in vivo models . 
We constructed a yqhC mutant of S. Typhimurium that was defective in invasion of epithelial cells , motility , and induction of cytotoxicity in host cells . 
Most importantly , the yqhC mutant was attenuated in induction of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines and mediation of host inﬂammatory responses in a murine model of infection . 
Transcriptional and proteomic analysis revealed that expression of several factors was altered in the yqhC mutant , these ﬁndings correlating with the yqhC phenotype . 
These data indicate that YqhC modulates expression of S. Typhimurium virulence factors . 
The mechanism by which YqhC affects Salmonella virulence is not known . 
DNA and amino acid analysis has indicated that YqhC is a potential DNA-binding protein belonging to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional activators ( 13 ) . 
AraC/XylS transcriptional activators have been shown to regulate stress response and virulence in several bacterial pathogens ( 21 -- 24 ) . 
In E.coli , expression of CFA/I pili is positively regulated by AraC/XylS transcriptional activator CfaD . 
CFA/I pili contribute to virulence in E.coli by mediating adherence to intestinal mucosa ( 23 ) . 
Similarly , AraC/XylS regulator ToxT mediates pathogenesis in Vibrio cholera by activating expression of type

IV pili TCP , which is necessary for colonization of host intestinal mucosa ( 24 ) . 
Furthermore , AraC/XylS regulator ExsA is the primary activator of T3SS gene expression in Pseudomanas aeruginosa ( 22 ) . 
In Salmonella , AraC/XylS regulators play a signiﬁcant role in pathogenesis and virulence . 
AraC/XylS activator InvF has been shown to bind DNA directly and activate the secreted effector molecules sipABCD , sigD , sptP , and sopE ; important virulence proteins secreted by the SPI-1 T3SS ( 25 -- 28 ) . 
In addition , HilD and HilC are important AraC/XylS transcriptional regulators that mediate expression of HilA , which then activates all genes necessary for a functional SPI-1 encoded T3SS ( 29 , 30 ) . 
Moreover , HilD and HilC activate regulator InvF independently of HilA ( 31 ) . 
AraC/XylS regulators are characterized by a conserved C-terminal DNA binding domain , suggesting that this common mechanism mediates binding to DNA ( 21 ) . 
While this manuscript was in preparation , Lee et al. reported that YqhC transcriptionally activates yqhD in E. coli K12 ( 32 ) . 
YqhD is an aldehyde reductase that removes toxic glyoxal from the bacterial cell by converting it to ethadiol . 
Further , this study showed that yqhD activation was induced by direct binding of YqhC to the promoter region of the yqhD gene ( 32 ) . 
This further conﬁrms YqhC as a potential regulatory activator . 
Therefore , it is possible that YqhC modulates expression of S. Typhimurium virulence factors directly by binding to the promoter site of these genes or indirectly by affecting other regulatory genes . 
It is important to delineate the mechanism by which YqhC modulates S. Typhimurium virulence . 
Such studies are now underway in our laboratory . 
Invasion of host cells is a critical feature in Salmonella pathogenesis . 
Our in vitro data showed the yqhC mutant is deﬁcient in invasion of intestinal epithelial cells . 
Salmonella invasion is mediated by T3SS-1 proteins encoded in the SPI-1 ( 33 -- 35 ) . 
The inv ( invHGEABCI ) and prg ( prgHIJK ) operons contain T3SS apparatus genes essential for invasion of host cells ( 36 -- 41 ) . 
The spa ( spaOPQRS ) operon is required for invasion and secretion of effector proteins ( 42 , 43 ) . 
The sip ( sipABCD ) and sop genes ( sopD , sopB , sopE2 ) are composed of effector proteins secreted by the SPI-1 encoded T3SS ( 44 -- 47 ) . 
SPI-1 expression is under the control of several regulatory genes . 
HilA is a transcriptional activator for SPI-1 , and activates all genes necessary for a functional T3SS ( 48 , 49 ) . 
HilA is , in turn , induced by HilD and HilC and regulates InvF , which induces expression of secreted effector proteins located in SPI-1 ( 26 , 27 ) . 
Our transcriptome and proteome data on the yqhC mutant indicated down-regulation of a large portion of genes related to invasion in the SPI-1 ; including the entire inv , spa , sip , and prg operons , as well as hilA and hilD . 
In addition , SPI-1 dependant genes sopB , sopE2 , and sopD were also signiﬁcantly down-regulated . 
Moreover , studies have shown that FliZ , under the control of FlhDC , positively regulates hilA expression by controlling HilD post-translationally , through a mechanism independent of the Lon protease ( 50 ) . 
Our transcriptome data show that deletion of yqhC does not signiﬁcantly affect expression of ﬂiZ and ﬂhD . 
Therefore , the downregulation of HilD in this study could have resulted from strong expression of Lon or from some other YqhC related mechanism . 
This down-regulation of T3SS-1 genes necessary for invasion most likely causes the deﬁciency in invasion seen in the yqhC mutant . 
Deletion of yqhC rendered S. Typhimurium deﬁcient in inducing cytotoxicity in macrophage cells . 
Salmonella induced host cell cytotoxicity and death is mediated by both SPI-1 ( sipB ) and SPI-2 ( spiA ) secreted effector proteins ( 9 , 51 , 52 ) . 
The SPI-1 encoded protein SipB induces apoptosis in macrophages by binding and activating proapoptotic protease caspase-1 ( 9 ) . 
Our RNA-seq data showed a signiﬁcant down-regulation of sipB in the yqhC mutant , suggesting that YqhC affects expression of these genes , and therefore modulates induction of cytotoxicity in host cells . 
Bacterial motility is signiﬁcantly reduced in the yqhC mutant . 
Flagellar ﬁlament proteins ( ﬂagellins ) are an indispensible part of motility in many bacteria ( 53 , 54 ) . 
Salmonella undergoes phase variation , in which two distinct ﬂagellar ﬁlament proteins , FljB ( phase 2 ﬂagellin ) and FliC ( phase 1 ﬂagellin ) , are alternately expressed ( 55 , 56 ) . 
The gene for ﬂjB is located in an operon with the regulatory gene ﬂjA . 
When the ﬂjB-ﬂjA operon is expressed , FljB ﬂagellin is produced along with FljA , an inhibitor of FliC expression ( 57 , 55 ) . 
This ensures only FljB will be expressed when the ﬂjB-ﬂjA operon is turned on . 
Conversely , when the ﬂjB-ﬂjA operon is not expressed , FljA is no longer present in the cell to inhibit ﬂiC , allowing for expression of FliC ﬂagellin . 
Studies have shown that strains constitutively expressing the ﬂjB-ﬂjA operon , but containing a defective ﬂjB gene are nonmotile due to FljA inhibition of FliC ( 58 , 59 ) . 
It has been shown that , in the absence of ﬂjB expression , insufﬁcient ﬂagellin to allow motility is produced ( 58 , 59 ) . 
As indicated by our transcriptome data , ﬂjB ( -97 ) and ﬂjA ( -22 ) are markedly downregulated in the yqhC mutant , while ﬂiC is upregulated . 
Therefore , with the inhibition of ﬂjB in the yqhC mutant , FliC is the only ﬂagellin type being expressed , and it may not be sufﬁciently expressed to allow the motility seen in the WT . 
The mechanism by which YqhC affects the degree of ﬂagellin expression and ﬂagellar phase variation needs further investigation . 
To examine the degree of attenuation of the yqhC mutant in vivo , we used a well characterized murine model of infection by measuring LD50 , bacterial load in internal organs , induction of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines , and histopathology . 
Unexpectedly , deletion of yqhC did not affect the LD50 of Salmonella , a ﬁnding that conﬂicted with our in vitro data . 
While the reason for this discrepancy is not clear , redundancy in gene regulation and function may have played a role in compensation for down-regulated virulence genes . 
Attenuation in induction of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines and development of histopathological lesions was seen in mice infected with the yqhC mutant when compared to mice infected with the WT strain . 
The attenuation demonstrated in vivo correlated with the phenotype of virulence seen in vitro and the down-regulation of genes related to virulence indicated by our transcriptome and proteome data . 
The signiﬁcant decrease in mediation of histopathological lesions might have been a result of a decrease in induction of key inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 . 
Deletion of yqhC did not affect the ability of S. Typhimurium to survive and replicate in an in vivo system . 
On day 1 post-infection , bacterial loads in livers and spleens of mice infected with the yqhC mutant were signiﬁcantly lower than in mice infected with the WT . 
This observation was most likely due to the fact that fewer yqhC mutants initially invaded internal organs . 
However , there was no signiﬁcant difference in bacterial loads in livers and spleens of mice infected with the yqhC mutant compared to the WT on day 3 post-infection . 
Both strains replicated at similar rates in the liver and spleen of mice from days 1 to 3 post-infection . 
Overall , data presented here suggest that YqhC of S. Typhimurium affects virulence-related factors in vitro , however no clear role in vivo has been identiﬁed . 
Although the mechanism by which YqhC modulates virulence is not known , it is most likely that the DNA-binding domain of YqhC binds the promoter region of the corresponding genes . 
Our current study is directed towards understanding the mechanism by which YqhC plays a role in S. Typhimurium virulence . 
Potential DNA and protein interactions by YqhC are being assessed in order to identify the speciﬁc mechanism of regulation .
