Asymptomatic Salmonella-carrier pigs present a major problem in preharvest food safety , with a recent survey indicating > 50 % of swine herds in the United States have Salmonella-positive animals . 
Salmonella-carrier pigs serve as a reservoir for contamination of neighbouring pigs , abattoir pens and pork products . 
In addition , fresh produce as well as water can be contaminated with Salmonella from manure used as fertilizer . 
Control of Salmonella at the farm level could be through genetic improvement of porcine disease resistance , a potentially powerful method of addressing preharvest pork safety . 
In this research , we integrate gene expression proﬁling data and sequence alignment-based prediction of single nucleo-tide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) to successfully identify SNPs in functional candidate genes to test for the associations with swine response to Sal-monella . 
A list of 2527 genes that were differentially regulated in porcine whole blood in response to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were selected . 
In those genes , SNPs were predicted using ANEXdb alignments based on stringent clustering of all publically available porcine cDNA and expressed sequence tag ( EST ) sequences . 
A set of 30 mostly non-synonymous SNPs were selected for genotype analysis of four independent populations ( n = 750 ) with Salmonella faecal shedding or tissue colonization phenotypes . 
Nine SNPs segregated with minor allele frequency ‡ 15 % in at least two populations . 
Statistical analysis revealed SNPs associated with Salmonella shedding , such as haptoglobin ( HP , p = 0.001 , q = 0.01 ) , neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 ( NCF2 # 2 , p = 0.04 , q = 0.21 ) and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( p = 0.066 , q = 0.21 ) . 
These associations may be useful in identifying and selecting pigs with improved resistance to this bacterium .

Introduction
Salmonella enterica is one of the major causes of human food-borne gastroenteritis with an estimated 1.4 million cases and about 500 deaths in the United 
States annually ( Mead et al. 1999 ) . 
Pork is estimated to be one of the top ﬁve foods causing non-typhoid Salmonella illnesses in humans ( Hoffmann et al. 2007 ) . 
The US Food Safety Inspection Service indicated that about 7 % of market hog carcasses sampled between 1998 and 2000 contained Salmo-nella ( Rigney et al. 2004 ) . 
Furthermore , a survey carried out by the Collaboration of Animal Health and Food Safety Epidemiology showed in 2005 that approximately 58 % of pig farm sites sampled in ﬁve states of the United States were positive for Salmo-nella . 
Most recently , a study conducted on 24 hogfarms in Iowa during 2006 -- 09 found that 71.4 % of farms had at least one Salmonella-positive faecal sample ( Wang et al. 2010 ) . 
Salmonella-colonized pigs are usually asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium and can shed Salmonella upon exposure to stress , thereby contaminating their pen-mates , shipping equipment and lairage or holding pens of the abattoirs ( Hurd et al. 2001 ) . 
Salmonella contamination of the food chain extends beyond just contaminated meat and processed pork products . 
Fresh produce can be contaminated using manure as fertilizer from farms with Salmonella-carrier swine ( Guan & Holley 2003 ) . 
Thus , reduction in on-farm Salmonella prevalence is an essential step to improve preharvest food safety . 
Genetic improvement of disease resistance in animals is a potentially effective and sustainable method for addressing preharvest food safety issues .

Genetic control of the porcine immune response to pathogens has been previously reported ( Galina-Pan-toja et al. 2009 ; Reiner et al. 2008 ; Clapperton et al. 2009 ) . 
Differences in swine immune response have been found in porcine lines of high ( HIR ) and low immune response created by selection based on antibody and cellular assays ( Wilkie & Mallard 1999 ) . 
In general , HIR line animals demonstrated improved immune functions ; however , they also developed autoimmune issues ( Wilkie & Mallard 1999 ; Crawley et al. 2005 ) . 
Several quantitative trail loci ( QTL ) related with immune response have been described in swine . 
Those include QTL for humoral as well as stress-induced innate immune response , leucocyte counts , cytokine concentration , mitogen-induced proliferation and levels of prevaccination antibody to 
Esherichia coli ( Edfors-Lilja et al. 1998 , 2000 ; Reiner et al. 2008 ; Wimmers et al. 2009 ; Lu et al. 2011 ) . 
Furthermore , several speciﬁc regions in different porcine chromosomes have been associated with S. Chole-raesuis burden in spleen and liver at 7 days postexperimental inoculation ( Galina-Pantoja et al. 2009 ) . 
It has also been suggested that several immune traits including levels of acute phase protein alpha-1 , acid glycoprotein and subset CD11R1 + of peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes can predict health status of swine ( Clapperton et al. 2009 ) . 
Even though these reports show that immune response in pigs is genetically controlled , few speciﬁc genetic variants underlying variation in porcine immune response to Salmonella have been identiﬁed . 
In this research , we aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms in genes that are differentially regulated in pigs that persistently shed the bacteria versus low-shedding pigs , as such polymorphisms can be useful in predicting the effectiveness of immune responses . 
Sequence clustering and alignments were performed on all publicly available porcine cDNA sequences ( Couture et al. 2009 ) to predict single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the candidate genes selected from pig transcriptomic response data . 
Using a set of the most promising SNPs identiﬁed , 750 pigs from four different populations were genotyped and association of SNPs with Salmonella shedding or tissue coloniza-tion-related traits was identiﬁed . 
Materials and methods
Porcine populations
The four porcine populations with qualitative or quantitative Salmonella shedding or tissue colonization phenotypes that were used in this study are as follows : 
Field population
A recent survey of Salmonella incidence in swine farms in Iowa , USA , resulted in the collection of tissues and Salmonella faecal shedding data for > 7000 animals ( Wang et al. 2010 ) . 
Faecal samples were collected on the farm 7 days before transport and marketing and were tested for Salmonella presence as described later . 
From this population , we obtained tissue samples and isolated genomic DNA from 168 faecal-positive pigs and 237 faecal-negative control pigs . 
These controls were selected from the cohort of animals collected on that farm ⁄ day where a positive case was found ; where possible we used a sample that had been collected near where the faecal-posi-tive sample was collected . 
For genotyping , we used these 405 ﬁeld population pigs . 
IAH-Compton population
This experimental challenge population contains a total of 228 pigs from four speciﬁc sire families of commercial pigs as described in the study by ( van Diemen et al. 2002 ) . 
Brieﬂy , ﬁrst generation offspring from two boars that were potentially susceptible and resistant as well as two unknown boars were experimentally infected with S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis ( S. Choleraesuis ) , followed by the enumeration of the bacteria in liver and spleen 7 days postinfection . 
The phenotypic data and DNA samples from this population were a gift from Pig Improvement Company . 
Even though the entire 228-pigs population was genotyped , only offspring ( a total of 163 pigs ) were used for statistical association analysis . 
National Animal Disease Center (NADC)-40 population
This experimental challenge population contains 40 mixed breed pigs that were experimentally inoculated with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) ; details on this experiment were reported by Uthe et al. ( 2009 ) . 
Brieﬂy , at days 2 , 7 , 14 and 20 postinoculation ( pi ) , quantitative Salmonella faecal shedding data were collected . 
At day 21 pi , ileo-caecal lymph nodes ( ICLN ) were collected , and Salmonella presence in this tissue was determined as described by Uthe et al. ( 2009 ) . 
of putative SNPs 
NADC-77 population
Seventy-seven mixed breed pigs in this population were intranasally challenged at 7 weeks of age with 1 · 109 CFU of S. Typhimurium v4232 as previously described by Uthe et al. ( 2009 ) . 
At days 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 and 21 pi , Salmonella faecal shedding was quantiﬁed . 
All procedures involving animals in the NADC-40 and NADC-77 populations were lawful and approved by the USDA , ARS , NADC Animal Care and Use 
Committee.
Sample collection , Salmonella bacteriology and DNA 
isolation 
For the ﬁeld population , individual faecal samples ( 20 -- 30 g ) were collected into labelled plastic bags at the same time as animals were tattooed . 
Matched belly ﬂap samples were collected at the abattoir from dressed carcasses using a unique slap tattoo number . 
Belly ﬂap samples were placed in plastic bags and frozen for later DNA preparation . 
To identify pigs shedding Salmonella , qualitative bacteriology was performed as follows : 10 g samples of swine faeces were assayed in duplicates using Salmonella enrichment and selective media as previously described ( Wang et al. 2010 ) . 
Positive isolates were conﬁrmed by sero-group antiserum agglutination assays . 
To isolate DNA from belly ﬂaps ( ﬁeld population ) and liver tissues ( NADC-40 population ) , about 20 mg of tissues samples was digested with protein-ase K ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 
DNA from tissue lysates was extracted using Wizard SV geno-mic DNA puriﬁcation system ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
For the NADC-77 population , DNA was isolated from the pigs ' whole blood preserved in Pax-tubes ( PreAnalytiX ; Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) using the DNeasy Blood and tissue kit ( Qiagen ) , according to the manufacturers instructions . 
DNA was quantiﬁed by Nanodrop ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Wilmington , DE , USA ) , and DNA quality was checked by A260 ⁄ A280 ratios and agarose gel electrophoresis . 
Selection of functional candidate genes and prediction 
As candidates for SNP analysis , genes were selected that our Affymetrix microarray data indicated were differentially expressed in porcine whole blood 2 days after inoculation with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Tinghua Huang et al. , submitted manu-script ) . 
Based on the analysis of facal shedding , two classes of pigs were identiﬁed in this experimental S. Typhimurium challenge using the NADC-40 population : low-shedder pigs stopped shedding the bacteria after day 7 of the experiment and high-shedder pigs continued shedding the bacteria until the end of the 21-day study ( Uthe et al. 2009 ) . 
Genes that were differentially regulated between the two shedding classes with q < 0.1 and fold change ‡ 1.5 were selected for prediction of SNPs using the ANEXdb database ( http://www.anexdb.org; Couture et al. . 
2009 ) . 
Predicted SNPs in ANEXdb are created from a stringent clustering of similar sequences ( using TGICL ) and alignment ( using CAP3 ) of all available porcine cDNA sequences submitted to NCBI by Feb-ruary 2009 ( see Couture et al. 2009 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the assembly was designed to separate close gene family members as well as alternative splicing by ﬁrst requiring at most 30-bp unmatched overhangs with at least 30-bp overlapping ( being automatically adjusted for long sequences ) , having at least 94 % identity in the overlapping area . 
Large clusters were then re-clustered using full-length clones , which increases the stringency of the programme , needing an almost perfect match without overhangs ( Pertea et al. 2003 ) . 
CAP3 was used on each cluster individually . 
To extract the SNPs for the sequences of interest , the target sequence for the porcine Affymetrix probe sets was used with blast to ﬁnd the highest scoring match between the Affymetrix target sequence and the AnexDB consensus sequence . 
The SNPs in the ANEXdb were predicted by comparing the base at each location on the consensus sequence with all available cDNA sequences that overlapped that particular base . 
If there was a base difference at that location , the estimated frequency of the SNP was calculated by the number of sequences with that SNP compared with the total number of sequences that overlapped that particular location . 
In addition to the frequency , the total number of sequences with and without the SNP were also recorded and stored in the database . 
To select a SNP for further analysis , a minimum of three counts of the minor allele that was different from the allele on the consensus sequence reported by the database was required . 
DNA genotyping
DNA genotyping was performed using MassARRAY technology ( MassARRAY Compact System ; Seque-nom Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 
Selection of SNPs for multiplex reaction , primer design ( Table S1 ) and genotyping was made using the iPLEX reagent kit and the Sequenom Typer 3.1 software according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Sequenom , http : / / www.sequenom.com ) . 
Assays that had a minimum of 80 % of genotyping calls and minor allele frequency ( MAF ) of at least 15 % in at least one of the four populations were subsequently statistically analysed . 
Markers such as NCF1 # 2 and DDRGK1 that were insufﬁciently genotyped in Sequenom analysis were completely genotyped using tetra primer ampli-ﬁcation refractory mutation system ( ARMS ) - PCR technology , with primers designed using software at http://cedar.genetics.soton.ac.uk/public_html/primer1 . 
html ( Ye et al. 2001 ) . 
PCRs containing 30 ng of DNA template , 10 pmol of each inner primer and 1 pmol of each outer primer were prepared in 10-ll volume using GoTaq Hot Start Green Master Mix ( Promega ) . 
Touchdown PCR conditions were as follows : 2 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 C , 1 min at 75 C for the ﬁrst cycle , decreasing by 1 C each cycle until the temperature of 60 C was reached and continuing at that annealing temperature for the rest of the cycles and then 1 min at 72 C and ﬁnal extension 10 min at 72 C. PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis ( Table 1 ) . 
Statistical analysis
Statistical association analysis of genotype and Salmo-nella shedding and ⁄ or tissue colonization phenotype was performed in the statistical computing environment R , with all code available upon request . 
NADC-40 , NADC-77 and the Compton populations Because of small sample sizes and ⁄ or non-normal distributions , permutation-based hypothesis testing was used to assess the signiﬁcance of the association of each SNP with each phenotype in each population separately . 
Within each population , the test statistic used for permutation testing was carefully chosen based on the nature of the phenotype and the structure of block factors unique to each population , as described in the subsections later . 
Regardless of the test statistic selected , permutation testing was carried out for each population , phenotype and SNP as follows . 
First , the test statistic was computed for the original data . 
Then , SNP genotypes were randomly shufﬂed 19 999 times within the levels of the available block factor ( s ) . 
The test statistic was then recomputed for each of these 19 999 data sets . 
The resulting 20 000 test statistics provided a reference distribution under the null hypothesis of no association . 
A permutation p-value was computed as the proportion of these 20 000 statistics that were as extreme as or more extreme than the statistic observed for the original data . 
Details speciﬁc to each population are as follows : 
IAH-Compton population
Two log-transformed count traits -- spleen counts ( splC ) and liver counts ( livC ) -- were analysed separately for each SNP . 
Each combination of group , sire and dam was treated as a distinct level of a block factor . 
The test statistic was chosen to be the weighted average of the within-SNP-genotype pairwise Euclidean distances , with weights being within-SNP-genotype sample size ( see the MRPP ( multiresponse permutation procedure ) statistic proposed by Mielke & Berry 2007 ) .

NADC-40 population
The phenotypes for this population included a univariate binary ICLN trait and a four-dimensional ( four time points pi ) shedding count trait . 
Sow was the only block factor . 
For the binary ICLN trait , a logistic regression model was used with block factor and SNP as a ﬁxed factor of interest . 
The asymptotic p-value for testing for a SNP effect was computed as described for the ﬁeld population . 
However , because the sample size was too small for the asymptotic approximation to work well , the asymptotic p-value was used as the test statistic in the permutation test to provide a ﬁnite sample exact p-value . 
The four-dimensional shedding count trait was transformed by taking natural logarithms after add-ing one to each count to avoid inﬁnite logarithms . 
The test statistic for this four-dimensional log-trans-formed trait was the MRPP statistic as in the IAH-Compton population , except that the Euclidean distance was computed in the four-dimensional space . 
NADC-77 population
Selection of functional candidate genes for SNP 
The phenotype for this population was a ﬁve-dimen-sional ( ﬁve time points pi ) shedding count trait . 
The test statistic for this ﬁve-dimensional trait was the MRPP statistic as in the IAH-Compton population , except that the Euclidean distance was computed in the ﬁve-dimensional space . 
analysis 
Field population
The binary Salmonella shedding status trait was used as the response variable . 
A logistic regression model was used , with farm-and-visit combination as a block factor and SNP as a ﬁxed factor of interest . 
Owing to the complete separation of the binary trait with either block or the SNP of interest , not all maximum likelihood estimates of parameters were ﬁnite . 
Hence , Firth 's penalized likelihood method was used for parameter estimation ( Firth 1993 ) . 
The modiﬁed ( Rao 's ) score statistic was computed for the SNP of interest , based on Firth 's modiﬁed score equation ( Heinze & Schemper 2002 ) . 
Because the number of explanatory variables was very large , the asymptotic p-value was then computed from the score statistic based on a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of SNP levels minus 
Error control for multiple tests
Because of multiple hypothesis tests performed in the analyses , we controlled SNP false discovery rates ( FDR ) from the set of p-values for each trait in each population separately , using a procedure similar to that of Storey & Tibshirani ( 2003 ) . 
The default smoother method used by Storey & Tibshirani ( 2003 ) was not stable because we had only dozens of p-values . 
Thus , we chose to set the lambda parameter discussed by Storey & Tibshirani ( 2003 ) to be the observed p-value such that the difference between the p-value itself and the empirical distribution function evaluated at this p-value was maximum . 
When the number of p-values is large , this modiﬁcation results in more conservative FDR control , i.e. , it controls FDR by providing a wider safety margin . 
Note that this FDR estimator also provides a natural estimate of the proportion of false positives ( PFP ) . 
Hence , even though the multiple testing procedure was applied to each phenotype-by-population combination separately , the procedure also provides a reasonable estimate of PFP when all hypotheses in the current study are considered together . 
Results
Global gene expression proﬁling of pigs persistently shedding S. Typhimurium versus low-shedder pigs identiﬁed 2527 annotated differentially regulated genes ( q < 0.1 , fold change in response to infection ‡ 1.5 ; Figure 1 ) . 
Analysis of these genes by the ANE-Xdb database ( http://www.anexdb.org; Couture et al. 2009 ) identiﬁed 4346 SNPs in 330 differentially expressed genes that included upregulated as well as downregulated genes in the persistent-shedder and low-shedder categories ( Figure 1 ) . 
To focus on the SNPs most likely to affect protein function , only SNPs located within a predicted open reading frame were selected , resulting in 1236 SNPs in 167 genes . 
Further , polymorphisms causing a non-synonymous amino acid substitution were chosen , resulting in 65 SNPs in 57 genes . 
In addition , another 11 SNPs were identiﬁed within these differentially expressed genes from predictions in Pig EST Data Explorer ( PEDE ) , a database of cDNA sequences from Western and Chinese breeds ( Uenishi et al. 2007 ) , or the comprehensive DFCI ( Dana Farber Cancer Institute ) Pig Gene Index ( http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/ cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl ? 
gudb = pig ) . 
one . 
Based on the gene selection criteria described earlier , we identiﬁed a set of 76 SNPs in 66 genes , and 30 SNPs in 27 genes were able to be multiplexed for genotyping by Sequenom software . 
Tetra-ARMS PCR manual genotyping was employed to complete genotyping where < 80 % of alleles were typed by Sequenom ; ﬁnal genotyping data were obtained for 28 SNPs . 
Thirteen SNPs in 12 genes segregated in the populations tested , another 13 SNPs were monomorphic , and two SNPs came from a misalignment of two closely related genes and were removed from further analysis . 
Of these segregating SNPs , nine were predicted by ANEXdb alignments ( of 21 predictions tested ) , while two were predicted from PEDE alignments ( of ﬁve predictions tested ) and two from DFCI alignments ( of two predictions tested ) . 
Thus , this paper reports the analysis results of 13 segregating SNPs in 12 genes . 
With MAF of 15 % or greater , eleven SNPs in ten genes segregated in at least one of the four populations ; while nine SNPs in eight genes segregated in two or more populations ( Table 2 ) . 
Statistical analysis assessed the associations of the SNPs with Salmonella shedding or tissue colonization phenotypes ( Table 3 ) . 
In the ﬁeld population , a SNP in the haptoglobin ( HP ) gene was associated ( p = 0.001 , estimated FDR or q = 0.01 ) with Salmo-nella shedding status ( Figure 2 ) . 
In the NADC-77 population , SNP # 2 in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 ( NCF2 ) gene was potentially associated ( p = 0.04 , q = 0.21 ) with quantitative faecal bacterial shedding over the time course of infection ( Figure 3 ) . 
A SNP in the phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( PGD ) gene also showed suggestive evidence of association ( p = 0.07 . 
q = 0.21 ) with bacterial shedding in the

Discussion
Field and experimental data indicate that some pigs colonized with Salmonella become chronic carriers , while others can clear the bacteria ( Hurd et al. 2001 ) . 
However , the underlying causes for such differences in response to Salmonella at the genetic level are not known . 
Recent work has characterized the porcine transcriptional response to Salmonella ( Wang et al. 2007 , 2008 ) and has demonstrated that differences between swine in their phenotypic response to this bacterium can be detected at the gene expression level ( Tinghua Huang et al. , submitted manu-script ) . 
We successfully used this novel global gene expression information to select genes that may contribute to host control of Salmonella , identiﬁed polymorphisms in those genes using our expressed sequence database , and analysed these variants for their association with Salmonella-related traits in four porcine populations .

association analysis is creating natural or experimental challenge populations with appropriate phenotypic records , which in large food animals is a very difﬁcult process , involving substantial expense and logistic work . 
In this research , we were able to use samples and phenotypic data from the largest published experimental Salmonella challenge population in pigs , the IAH-Compton population ( van Diemen et al. 2002 ) . 
Also , we created two additional experimental challenge populations , NADC-40 and NADC-77 . 
Furthermore , by sampling pigs from 24 farms across Iowa , we created a unique data set representing naturally occurring Salmonella colonization status in pigs . 
Thus , in total for genotyping and association analysis , we used 750 pigs from four populations with a variety of Salmonella exposures including 
S. Typhimurium ( NADC-40 , NADC-77 ) , S. Choleraesuis ( IAH-Compton ) and mixed Salmonella spp . 
( ﬁeld population ) . 
For prediction and high-throughput extraction of putative and SNPs in differentially expressed genes , we used ANEXdb , a new database with the most recent and largest number of porcine consensus sequences and predicted SNPs , which were created from all publicly available ESTs ( Couture et al. 2009 ) . 
Although genome-wide high-throughput genotyping technologies are available to type large numbers of SNPs , we chose to assess association of a highly reﬁned list of candidate genes . 
Owing to the relatively small number of animals , genome-wide genotyping would not have provided enough power for association analysis . 
By selecting a relatively small number of putative SNPs with a minor allele incidence of three or greater and without any preli-minary genotyping , we were able to conﬁrm segregation of 43 % of ANEXdb-predicted SNPs and 40 % of the PEDE-predicted SNPs in our populations . 
Many of the predicted SNPs in the ANEXdb database are derived from sequence data of a broad population of pig breeds , including diverse non-commercial breeds such as Chinese Meishan and European wild boar which we did not survey in our populations with Salmonella colonization phenotypes . 
Thus , our data validate the usefulness of ANEXdb-predicted SNPs tested at a minor allele incidence level of n = 3 . 
In addition , ANEXdb was useful in conﬁrming SNP predictions in differentially regulated porcine genes that had no annotation at NCBI . 
In this study , we provide evidences for three associations of 13 segregating SNPs ; however , we did not identify SNPs with association across populations . 
Owing to the different phenotypes measured across populations , associations with a speciﬁc phenotype may be difﬁ-cult to detect in multiple populations .

The segregating SNPs in this study belonged to genes from several differential expression categories , as targeted by the gene selection process . 
In particular , polymorphisms were identiﬁed in genes that were upregulated in persistent-shedders as well as in low-shedders ( HP , NCF1 , SULT1A1 , PGD and SERPINB1 ) ; upregulated only in persistent shedders with no change in expression in low shedders ( GLS2 , 
DDRGK1 and RNH1 ) ; and upregulated in low shedders but downregulated in persistent shedders ( ELF3 , HLA-A and ITIH1 ) . 
The SNPs associating with Salmo-nella shedding or tissue colonization were in genes involved in a variety of cellular functions from immunity to metabolism . 
The HP gene has a SNP associated with Salmonella shedding status in the ﬁeld population and encodes a multifunctional acute phase protein involved in haemoglobin metabolism and inﬂammation ( Huntoon et al. 2008 ) . 
Expression of HP is induced upon different inﬂammatory stimuli , preventing loss of iron , protecting cells from oxi-dative damage ; stimulating T-cell responses and development of adaptive immunity ( Huntoon et al. 2008 ) . 
In addition , HP is one of the genes that are non-tolerized by iterated lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation ( Foster et al. 2007 ) . 
Repeated treatment of a murine macrophage cell line with LPS did not repress but instead further induced the expression of HP , indicating that this gene can directly contribute to antibacterial defence function of the host . 
In calves , levels of serum HP were correlated with diarrhoea , morbidity and rectal temperatures after mixed infection with S. Dublin , S. Enteriditis and 
Figure 3 Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms # 2 in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 gene with Salmonella faecal shedding in 
S. Heidelberg ( Deignan et al. 2000 ) . 
Swine levels of serum HP serve as a marker of clinical or sub-clinical disease status and correlate with age and weight gain the National Animal Disease Center-77 population , p = 0.04 , q = 0.21 . 
There were n = 12 pigs of A ⁄ A genotype , n = 42 pigs of G ⁄ A genotype and n = 20 pigs of G ⁄ G genotype . 
Y-axis represents the day-aver-aged cumulative area under the log curve of shedding counts , which indicates the average shedding per day from day 0 to each day of 
( Chung et al. 2008 ) . 
Differences in HP mRNA expression in whole blood were found at 2 days postinoculation with S. Typhimurium , with about 2 - and 1.3-fold induction in low-shedder and persistent-shedder pigs , respectively ( Tinghua Huang et al. , submitted manuscript ) . 
Other polymorphisms in the porcine HP sequence have been identiﬁed by other research-ers and were associated with HP baseline serum levels ( Diack et al. 2008 ) as well as with serum concentration of complement factor 3c , following immunization against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae , Aujeszky 's disease and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( Wimmers et al. 2009 ) . 
We report a SNP at position 471 of HP sequence NM_214000 .1 , with pigs of C ⁄ C genotype having the highest probability of being Salmonella shedders compared with C ⁄ T and T ⁄ T pigs ( Figure 2 ) . 
A SNP ( TC222915 : c1108G > A ) in NCF2 was potentially associated with Salmonella shedding over the time course of infection in the NADC-77 population . 
The NCF2 gene encodes a cytosolic subunit of neutrophil nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase , the enzyme for the production of superoxide anions exerting microbicidal effect in the neutrophil phagosomes . 
Oxidative burst capacity of neutrophils has been shown to be involved in swine and mice resistance to Salmonella ( van Diemen et al. 2002 ; Sancho-Shimizu & Malo 2006 ) , suggesting an involvement of NCF2 in this process . 
Our research indicates that pigs with the G ⁄ G genotype at NCF2 TC222915 : c1108G > A have signiﬁcantly reduced the numbers of the bacterium in faeces at 1 and 2 days postinoculation with S. Typhimurium . 
A SNP in the PGD gene , which causes an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at position 214 , was marginally associated with Salmonella shedding in the NADC-77 population . 
The enzyme PGD or phosphogluconate dehydrogenase catalyses the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphog-luconolactone , the ﬁrst step in the pentose phosphate pathway resulting in the production of pentose sugars and NADPH involved in respiratory burst of neutrophils and macrophages ( Mason et al. 2007 ) . 
The activity of NADPH is well known to be involved in host response to Salmonella ( van Diemen et al. 2002 ) , suggesting an involvement of PGD in the swine response to this bacterium . 
Our micro-array analysis revealed that expression of PGD was induced ﬁvefold ( q = 0.001 ) in blood of persistent-shedder pigs and twofold ( q = 0.1 ) in low-shedder pigs ( Tinghua Huang et al. , submitted manuscript ) . 
Pigs with homozygous G ⁄ G genotype of the SNP in PGD had fewer bacteria at day 1 postinoculation and ⁄ to note , all seven pigs with G G genotype fell within the low-shedder category .

This research demonstrates a novel approach in the selection of candidate genes for association analyses of genetic polymorphisms by integrating gene expression proﬁling data and bioinformatic analysis tools . 
We also recognize that there are genes that could control swine resistance to Salmonella that are not differentially expressed in response to this bacte-rium and that our selection method would not ﬁnd such genes . 
In our SNP selection , we speciﬁcally targeted non-synonymous SNPs in the genes differentially regulated between pigs belonging to different faecal shedding classes . 
For the ﬁrst time , we have associated speciﬁc SNPs in the HP and NCF2 genes and provided suggestive evidence for the association of PGD with Salmonella shedding in pigs . 
These associated SNPs can now be evaluated as potential candidates for selection of pigs with improved ability to control Salmonella and shed fewer bacteria . 
Validation of these associated markers will need to be made as additional and larger populations with Sal-monella-related phenotypes are developed .
