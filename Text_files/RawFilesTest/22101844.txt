Mutants of Salmonella enterica lacking apbC have nutritional and biochemical properties indicative of defects in iron-sulfur ( [ Fe-S ] ) cluster metabolism . 
An apbC mutant is unable to grow on tricarballylate as a carbon source . 
Based on the ability of ApbC to transfer an [ Fe-S ] cluster to an apoprotein , this defect was attributed to poor loading of the [ Fe-S ] cluster-containing TcuB enzyme . 
Consistent with these observations , a previous study showed that overexpression of iscU , which encodes an [ Fe-S ] cluster molecular scaffold , suppressed the tricarballylate growth defect of an apbC mutant ( J. M. Boyd , J. A. Lewis , J. C. Escalante-Semerena , and D. M. Downs , J. Bacteriol . 
190:4596 -- 4602 , 2008 ) . 
In this study , tcuC mutations that suppress the growth defect of an apbC mutant by decreasing the intracellular concentration of tricarballylate are described . 
Collectively , the suppressor analyses support a model in which reduced TcuB activity prevents growth on tricarballylate by ( i ) decreasing catabo-lism and ( ii ) allowing levels of tricarballylate that are toxic to the cell to accumulate . 
The apbC tcuC mutant strains described here reveal that the balance of the metabolic network can be altered by the accumulation of deleterious metabolites . 
Iron and sulfur are essential to almost all bacteria , and cofactors containing these elements ( [ Fe-S ] clusters ) are nearly ubiquitous . 
Evolution has harnessed the ﬂexible biochemical and biophysical properties of these cofactors for a variety of cellular functions , including enzymatic reactions , electron transfer , DNA metabolism , and environmental sensing ( reviewed in references 8 and 27 ) . 
Three systems for [ Fe-S ] cluster biosynthesis have been described in bacteria . 
Work with Azotobacter vinelandii led to the discovery of the nif ( nitrogen fixation ) ( 55 ) and isc ( iron-sulfur cluster ) ( 54 ) [ Fe-S ] cluster biosynthetic operons . 
A third system , encoded by the suf ( sulfur utilization factor ) operon , was discovered in Escherichia coli ( 47 ) . 
The genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes both the iscSUA-hscAB-fdx-orf3 and sufABCDSE operons ( 36 , 47 ) . 
Both bioinformatics and in vivo genetic approaches have identiﬁed several loci outside the isc , suf , and nif operons that impact [ Fe-S ] cluster metabolism . 
The apbC , rseC , and apbE loci were discovered in Salmonella enterica by using sensitive genetic screens that exploited phenotypes described for strains lacking isc operon functions ( 6 , 7 , 38 , 44 -- 46 ) . 
ApbC is a 40-kDa cytoplasmic protein that can bind and rapidly transfer [ Fe-S ] clusters to a target protein ( 15 ) and hydrolyze ATP ( 16 , 44 ) . 
Both of these activities are necessary for in vivo function ( 16 ) . 
ApbC is a representative member of an ancient family of [ Fe-S ] cluster biosynthetic proteins that evolved before the divergence of the Archaea and Eucarya ( 13 ) . 
To our knowledge , all organisms that have sequenced genomes and are known to metabolize iron encode a copy of an apbC homologue . 
In contrast , the functions of the rseC and apbE gene products remain unknown . 
The erpA , nfuA , cyaY , and ygfZ genes were identiﬁed in bacteria by using bioinformatic approaches , and subsequent physiological studies found that these gene products function in [ Fe-S ] metab-olism ( 2 , 4 , 35 , 37 , 49 ) . 
The NfuA and ErpA proteins show sequence similarity to the proposed [ Fe-S ] cluster-trafﬁcking protein IscA , and like IscA , they have been shown to bind [ Fe-S ] clusters and transfer them to apoproteins ( 2 , 4 , 25 , 35 ) . 
Collectively , these studies have led to a model in which simple [ Fe-S ] clusters are synthesized using the Isc , Suf , or Nif system and are transferred to NfuA , ApbC , or A-type proteins that may trafﬁc clusters to cellular targets ( 4 , 15 , 35 ) . 
CyaY is hypothesized to be an Fe donor for [ Fe-S ] cluster biosynthesis ( 1 , 49 ) . 
The function of YgfZ remains unknown ( 51 ) . 
Thorough genetic analysis of loci involved in Fe and [ Fe-S ] cluster metabolism has been difﬁcult because functional overlap between gene products complicates sensitive genetic screens . 
For instance , although the genomes of the model organisms S. enterica and E. coli contain both the isc and suf operons , either one of these operons is sufﬁcient for cell viability ( 47 ) . 
Furthermore , the ge-nomes of these organisms encode the proposed [ Fe-S ] cluster scaffolding/traf ﬁcking proteins IscA , IscU , SufBCD , SufA , NfuA , ApbC , and ErpA . 
Biochemical and genetic studies have found that functional overlap exists between the IscU , NifU , and ApbC proteins , as well as between the A-type proteins ErpA , IscA , and SufA ( 14 , 21 , 48 ) . 
With the exception of ErpA , NifU , and ApbC , genetic evidence to suggest preferential cellular targets for these [ Fe-S ] cluster scaffolding/traf ﬁcking proteins remains to be reported ( 26 , 35 ) . 
The tricarballylate catabolic pathway in Salmonella enterica has shown promise as a genetic system with which to examine [ Fe-S ] cluster metabolism ( 14 , 30 ) . 
Importantly , the tricarballylate utili-zation genes tcuABC are carried in an operon , and a model for tricarballylate metabolism has been described ( 31 , 33 ) . 
In this model ( Fig. 1A ) , TcuC transports tricarballylate across the inner membrane , where it is oxidized to cis-aconitate by the ﬂavoprotein TcuA ( 31 ) . 
During growth on tricarballylate , the reduced ﬂa-vin of TcuA is recycled by TcuB , a membrane-bound protein that contains two [ 4Fe-4S ] clusters and heme ( 32 ) . 
Presumably , cis-aconitate is then hydrated to isocitrate by the [ Fe-S ] clustercontaining aconitase enzymes ( AcnA , AcnB ) . 
The expression of the three-gene operon is under the control of TcuR , a LysR-type transcriptional regulator ( 34 ) . 
Induction of the tcuABC genes requires the presence of both TcuR and the coinducer tricarballylate . 
S. enterica strains lacking ApbC are unable to grow on tricarballylate as a sole carbon and energy source , and the TcuB protein has 100-fold-lower activity when overproduced in an apbC mutant than in a wild-type ( wt ) strain ( 14 ) .

ApbC during growth on tricarballylate , contributing to a model in which ApbC was the primary cellular component responsible for the maintenance of the [ Fe-S ] clusters in TcuB ( Fig. 1A ) ( 14 , 15 ) . 
This study continues efforts to gain insight into the function of ApbC in the context of the metabolic network of S. enterica . 
Collectively , our studies have culminated in a model in which a constraint at TcuB , caused by the lack of ApbC , has two consequences that can be solved by distinct mechanisms . 
First , decreased TcuAB activity prevents tricarballylate oxidation , resulting in insufﬁcient carbon ﬂux through the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle for growth . 
In this case , an increase in non-ApbC loading of clusters in TcuB ( allowed by overexpression of the Fe-S cluster scaffold IscU [ 14 ] ) increases TcuB function . 
Second , tricarballylate accumulates , inhibiting TCA-cycle enzymes and thus preventing growth ( described in this study ) . 
Inhibition of tricarballylate transport decreased its accumulation and allowed time for the non-ApbC-mediated loading of clusters in TcuB . 
The tcuC mutant strains described here further our understanding of the consequences of the metabolic imbalance that occurs in the absence of ApbC . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , media , and chemicals . 
All strains used in this study are derived from S. enterica LT2 , and their genotypes are listed in Table 1 . 
The NCE ( no-carbon E salts ) medium of Berkowitz et al. ( 9 ) was made with Milli-Q ﬁltered water ( MQH2O ) and was supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4 and trace minerals ( 3 , 20 , 50 ) . 
Glucose , citrate , and tricarballylate were added to NCE medium at 11 mM , 11 mM , and 20 mM , respectively . 
Difco nutrient broth ( NB ) ( 8 g/liter ) with NaCl ( 5 g/liter ) or lysogenic broth ( 10 , 11 ) was used as a rich medium . 
Difco BiTek agar was added ( 15 g/liter ) for a solid medium . 
When present in the medium , supplements were provided at the following ﬁnal concentrations : thiamine , 10 nM or 100 nM ; adenine , 0.4 mM ; nicotinic acid , 20 M . 
When needed , antibiotics were added to the following concentrations in rich or minimal me-dium , respectively : tetracycline , 20 or 10 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 or 125 g/ml ; chloramphenicol , 20 or 4 g/ml ; ampicillin , 50 or 15 g/ml . 
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich . 
Genetic methods . 
( i ) Mutant isolation . 
Nine independent cultures of DM10300 ( apbC ) were grown to full density in NB medium . 
One hundred microliters of each culture ( 107 CFU ) was spread onto individual minimal tricarballylate thiamine plates . 
An average of 100 colonies arose spontaneously on each plate after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C . 
One colony derived from each culture was saved . 
( ii ) Isolation of linked insertions . 
The methods used for transduction and the puriﬁcation of transductants have been described previously ( 22 , 39 , 41 ) . 
Transposons [ Tn10d ( cat ) ] ( 23 ) genetically linked to the suppressor mutations were isolated by standard genetic techniques ( 28 ) . 
In each case , mutant strains were reconstructed and were veriﬁed phenotypically prior to characterization . 
The relevant insertions were mapped by sequencing using a PCR-based protocol ( University of Wisconsin Biotechnology DNA Sequence Facility ) ( 17 , 53 ) . 
Phenotypic analysis . 
Nutritional requirements were assessed on solid medium and by quantiﬁcation of growth in liquid medium using either 5-ml cultures in 25-ml shake tubes or 200 - l cultures in a 96-well plate . 
Protocols for each have been described elsewhere ( 7 , 29 ) . 
The starting A650 was routinely between 0.03 and 0.08 , with a ﬁnal A650 between 0.5 and 1.1 . 
Each culture had at least three replicates . 
Growth on solid medium was scored after replica printing to the relevant medium and incubation at 37 °C for 48 to 60 h. - Galactosidase assays . 
One hundred microliters from overnight cultures grown in NB-kanamycin medium was used to inoculate 5 ml of NB-kanamycin medium with or without 20 mM tricarballylate ( four rep-licates ) . 
Cultures were grown to an absorbance at 650 nm of 0.5 and were subsequently placed on ice . 
- Galactosidase activity was assessed as described previously ( 34 ) . 
FIG 1 Tricarballylate catabolism in S. enterica . 
( A ) Model for tricarballylate catabolism based on the work of Lewis et al. ( 31 ) . 
TcuC protein transports tricarballylate into the cell , where it is oxidized to cis-aconitate by the ﬂavoprotein TcuA . 
cis-Aconitate enters the TCA cycle through hydration to isocitrate , catalyzed by the aconitase enzymes ( AcnA , AcnB ) . 
The reduced ﬂavin of TcuA is recycled by passing the electrons to TcuB , which is thought to ultimately pass the electrons to the ubiquinone pool . 
ApbC is responsible for the insertion or repair of the two [ 4Fe-4S ] clusters of TcuB . 
( B ) A constraint at TcuB caused by the lack of ApbC has two consequences that can be solved by distinct suppressor mutations . 
First , decreased TcuAB activity prevents sufﬁcient ﬂux from tricarballylate from reaching the TCA cycle to allow growth . 
In this case , an increase in non-ApbC loading of clusters in TcuB increases TcuB function ( caused by iscR mutations [ 14 ] ) . 
Second , tricarballylate accumulates , inhibiting isocitrate dehydrogenase and thus preventing growth ( described in this study ) .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mutations in tcuC suppress the growth defect of an apbC mutant on tricarballylate . 
An S. enterica apbC mutant strain does not grow on tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source but is pro-ﬁcient for growth on glucose and other carbon sources ( e.g. , succinate , gluconate ) ( 14 ) . 
Five of nine independent spontaneous mutations that allowed strain DM10300 ( apbC ) to grow on a solid medium with 20 mM tricarballylate mapped to the iscR gene and have been described previously ( 14 ) . 
Genetic analysis determined that a Tn10d ( cat ) insertion in metT was 40 % cotransducible by phage P22 with the remaining four suppressor mutations , placing them near the tcu operon . 
Sequence analysis determined that each of the four mutations was a single base change in the tcuC gene , encoding the tricarballylate transporter ( 33 ) . 
The mutations resulted in variant TcuC proteins with G137S ( tcuC51 ) , C198S ( isolated twice ) ( tcuC54 ) , and W319R ( tcuC52 ) . 
In a medium with tricarballylate as the sole carbon and energy source , strain DM10310 ( wild type ) had a doubling time of 1.4 0.05 h , while strain DM10300 ( apbC ) had no detectable growth . 
Strains DM10448 ( apbC tcuC51 ) and DM10452 ( apbC tcuC54 ) had doubling times of 3.0 0.05 and 4.1 0.05 h , respectively , on tricarballylate . 
In addition to the increased doubling times of the suppressed strains , there was a signiﬁcant lag prior to the initiation of growth ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Suppression of the growth defect by tcuC52 was weak , and this allele was not characterized further . 
The tcuC alleles restored the growth of an apbC mutant on tricarballylate after a lag time of 15 to 30 h depending on the allele ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Upon reinoculation ( e.g. , outgrowth in fresh medium ) , the cultures displayed the same delay , demonstrating that the lag was an inherent property of the tcuC derivatives . 
We hypothesized that the lag reﬂected the time needed for the [ Fe-S ] clusters of TcuB to be loaded by an alternative ( ApbC-independent ) mechanism , resulting in a TcuB population capable of tricarballylate turnover . 
Suppressing tcuC alleles are recessive and encode variants that decrease tricarballylate transport . 
Plasmid pTCUC5 ( carrying functional TcuC ) was transformed into the wild-type strain ( DM10310 ) and apbC tcuC double mutant strains ( DM10448 , DM10452 ) . 
The mutant strains lost the ability to grow on tricarballylate when plasmid pTCUC5 was present , but not with the empty vector ( data not shown ) . 
The wild-type strain grew on tricarballylate with both plasmids , and all strains grew on glucose medium . 
These data supported the conclusion that the suppressor alleles of tcuC were recessive . 
The introduction of tcuC54 into a wild-type strain signiﬁcantly reduced the growth of the strain in tricarballylate medium ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The doubling times for strains DM10310 ( wt ) and DM11090 ( tcuC54 ) were 2.3 0.05 and 2.4 0.05 h , respectively , in 10 mM tricarballylate and 1.7 0.05 and 3.0 0.1 h , respectively , in 20 mM tricarballylate . 
DM11098 ( tcuC51 ) showed the same general growth trends as DM11090 ( tcu54 ) ( data not shown ) . 
Under each condition , the tcuC mutant strains reached a slightly lower ﬁnal density than the wild-type strain , suggesting that the TcuC variants might have a reduced afﬁnity for tricarballylate in addition to a reduced velocity . 
The E. coli MG1655 genome does not encode the tcu operon or a citrate transporter , rendering the strain unable to grow on citrate as a sole carbon source . 
Heterologous expression of tcuC in MG1655 results in sufﬁcient transport of citrate to allow growth ( 33 , 42 ) . 
Thus , the growth of E. coli strain MG1655 on citrate provided a means of measuring the transport activities of TcuC variants . 
Derivatives of MG1655 carrying plasmid pJMB122 ( tcuC ) , pJMB119 ( tcuC51 ) , or pJMB120 ( tcuC54 ) were generated , and growth on citrate was measured . 
The MG1655 strain carrying the empty vector had no detectable growth on citrate ( 11 mM ) . 
As reported previously , the MG1655 strain carrying pJMB122 ( tcuC ) grew with citrate ( doubling time , 2.0 0.05 h ; ﬁnal A650 , 0.5 0.05 ) . 
Plasmids pJMB119 ( tcuC51 ) and pJMB120 ( tcuC54 ) allowed growth on citrate , although with slightly greater doubling times ( 2.3 0.05 and 2.6 0.05 h , respectively ) and lower ﬁnal yields ( A650 , 0.2 0.05 for both strains ) than those of the strain carrying pJMB122 ( tcuC ) . 
All strains grew similarly on glucose medium ( data not shown ) . 
In total , the data presented above supported the conclusion that the suppressing alleles of tcuC encoded variant proteins whose transport function was compromised . 
FIG 3 Mutations in tcuC reduce growth on tricarballylate .

Isolation of tcuC mutations uncovers the inhibitory effect of tricarballylate in vivo . 
Previous results suggested that ApbC was involved in the maturation and/or repair of the [ Fe-S ] clusters in TcuB . 
These results led to the model ( Fig. 1 ) that compromised TcuB activity prevented the oxidation of tricarballylate to cis-aconitate , which led to the inability of an apbC mutant to grow on tricarballylate ( 15 , 30 ) . 
The isolation of tcuC mutants with mutations that suppressed the growth defect called for a reevaluation of this simple model . 
We hypothesized that the tcuC alleles suppressed the growth defect of an apbC mutant by reducing the intracellular accumulation of tricarballylate caused by compromised TcuB activity . 
In this scenario , the inability of apbC mutants to grow on tricarballylate would be caused by the accumulation of tricarballylate , inhibiting TCA-cycle enzymes , before TcuB could be sufﬁciently loaded with [ Fe-S ] clusters by the non-ApbC mechanism . 
By compromising TcuC , tricarballylate accumulation would be restricted , and the cells would be able to initiate outgrowth when the enzymes became available . 
This scenario depends on the hypothesis that the accumulation of tricarballylate is inhibitory . 
Strains with mutant tcuC alleles have lower intracellular tricarballylate levels . 
Transcription of the tcu operon provides a qualitative measure of tricarballylate levels in the cell , since tricarballylate is a necessary coactivator for TcuR , the activator of the tcu operon ( 34 ) . 
The 500 bp upstream of the tcuA start codon was cloned into a promotorless lacZ fusion vector ( pRS551 ) ( 43 ) , generating pJMB128 . 
Strains containing pJMB128 were grown to mid-log phase in NB medium with or without tricarballylate and were assayed for - galactosidase activity ( Table 2 ) . 
With all strains , tricarballylate was required for signiﬁcant - galactosidase activity . 
An apbC mutant ( DM10449 ) had 1.3-fold higher - galactosidase activity than the wild-type strain ( DM10310 ) . 
The presence of the tcuC51 ( DM11089 ) or tcuC54 ( DM11090 ) allele resulted in an 2.2-fold reduction in - galactosidase activity , suggesting that less tricarballylate was present in the cell . 
The apbC tcuC double mutants ( DM10448 , DM10452 ) had 1.3-fold higher - galactosidase activity than the tcuC single mutants ( DM11089 , DM11090 ) and 2.6-fold lower activity than the apbC single mutant ( DM10449 ) . 
These data are consistent with a model in which tricarballylate accumulates in an apbC mutant and the variant TcuC proteins reduce this accumulation . 
Tricarballylate accumulation is toxic in vivo . 
Cells were grown with citrate , which does not require TcuABC function , and were challenged with tricarballylate . 
This experiment uncoupled tricarballylate inhibition from tricarballylate utilization . 
The mutant allele tcuB17 encodes a nonfunctional TcuB protein and completely eliminates growth on tricarballylate . 
Further , this allele is nonpolar and thus does not affect the level of tcuC ( 33 ) . 
Strains DM10310 ( wild type ) and DM11428 ( tcuB17 ) were grown with 11 mM citrate in the absence or presence ( at 10 mM ) of tricarballylate . 
Strain DM11428 ( tcuB17 ) could not grow on citrate if tricarballylate was included in the medium at a concentration above 6 mM ( Fig. 4A ) , while the growth of the wild-type strain was unaffected by concentrations of tricarballylate up to 50 mM ( data not shown ) . 
At concentrations of tricarballylate below 6 mM , the inhibition of growth was quantiﬁed by the average time a culture took to reach mid-log phase . 
The data in Fig. 4 showed that strain DM11428 ( tcuB17 ) was sensitive to tricarballylate when growing with citrate , whereas strain DM10310 ( wild type ) was not . 
These results were consistent with an inhibitory effect of tricarballylate , which would accumulate in the tcuB mutant and not the wild-type strain . 
Strain DM11428 ( tcuB17 ) did not have a growth defect when grown with glucose , succinate , malate , fumarate , or gluco-nate in the presence of 10 mM tricarballylate ( data not shown ) . 
Together these data suggested that the target of the accumulated tricarballylate was one or more enzymes of the TCA cycle . 
The in vivo analyses described below addressed this general hypothesis . 
When strain DM10300 ( apbC ) was grown in citrate ( 11 mM ) , the time required to reach log phase was proportional to the concentration of tricarballylate , although this strain tolerated a much higher concentration of tricarballylate than strain DM11428 ( tcuB17 ) . 
These data were expected , since TcuB is only partially inactive in an apbC mutant ( 14 ) . 
Consistent with the hypothesis described above , the presence of either the tcuC51 or the tcuC54 allele relieved the growth defect of an apbC mutant on citrate with tricarballylate ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The growth of strains carrying only the tcuC alleles on citrate was unaffected by tricarballylate at concentrations as high as 30 mM ( data not shown ) . 
The target ( s ) of the inhibitory effect of tricarballylate was investigated by genetic means . 
A series of results were most consistent with tricarballylate compromising growth by inhibiting the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase ( Icd ) . 
Overexpression of aconitase alleles ( acnA or acnB ) did not alter the growth phenotypes of apbC mutant strains on tricarballylate . 
Furthermore , elimination of either AcnA or AcnB in the apbC tcuC double mutant strains had no effect on the growth suppression allowed by the tcuC alleles . 
In contrast , overexpression of Icd signiﬁcantly reduced the lag displayed by the apbC mutant strains ( data not shown ) . 
Although tricarballylate has been shown to inhibit aconitase in vitro , the data presented above suggest that tricarballylate inhibition of Icd is more relevant in generating the in vivo growth phenotypes ( 40 ) . 
Icd is required for growth on malate and succinate , yet the apbC mutant strains are not sensitive to tricarballylate on these carbon sources . 
Since malate and succinate derepress the TCA cycle , it is likely that despite being inhibited , Icd can provide enough ketoglutarate for growth under these conditions . 
This interpretation is consistent with the ability of overexpressed Icd to restore growth in the presence of tricarballylate ( described above ) . 
Mutations in iscU exacerbate sensitivity to tricarballylate . 
Overexpression of iscU suppressed the tricarballylate growth defect of an apbC mutant , yet a strain lacking iscU did not have a growth defect on tricarballylate ( 14 ) . 
These data led to the hypothesis that IscU could partially compensate for ApbC in the maturation of TcuB . 
In this scenario , the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either parental single mutant . 
Strains DM10300 ( apbC ) , DM11671 ( iscU ) , and DM11046 ( apbC iscU ) were grown with 11 mM citrate in the presence of 0 to 30 mM tricarballylate . 
The presence of tricarballylate in the growth me-dium did not affect the time that it took the iscU mutant ( DM11671 ) to reach mid-log-phase growth , but both strains DM10300 ( apbC ) and DM11221 ( iscU apbC ) took longer to reach log phase when tricarballylate was present ( Fig. 6 ) . 
The iscU apbC double mutant was signiﬁcantly more sensitive to tricarballylate than the apbC single mutant , consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of apbC mutants is allowed by IscU-dependent maturation of the [ Fe-S ] clusters in TcuB . 
Consistent with this interpretation was the ﬁnding that the tcuC mutations failed to restore growth on tricarballylate as a sole carbon source to the apbC iscU double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
Summary . 
Collectively , our studies have led to a model for the inability of apbC mutants to grow with tricarballylate as a sole carbon source ( Fig. 1 ) . 
In the absence of ApbC , TcuB protein is defective , which leads to the accumulation of tricarballylate in the cytoplasm . 
Our data suggest that tricarballylate is toxic to cells because it inhibits citric acid cycle enzymes , which are required for tricarballylate metabolism . 
Our model suggests that increasing the amount of active [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster-loaded TcuB protein through overexpression of IscU will reduce the tricarballylate concentration . 
Here we found that the intracellular tricarballylate concentration could be lowered by decreasing the activity of the tricarballylate transporter TcuC . 
We hypothesize that lowering the intracellular tricarballylate concentration by either means is sufﬁcient to relieve the tricarballylate-mediated inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase and to allow increased carbon ﬂux through the citric acid cycle to yield cell growth . 
The ﬁnding that the growth defects of a strain with a null apbC allele were similar to , but not as severe as , those of a strain with a null tcuB allele ( i.e. , lack of growth on tricarballylate , sensitivity to tricarballylate ) suggested that a fraction of TcuB protein remained active in a strain with an apbC mutation . 
The residual TcuB activity may reﬂect the permissiveness of alternative cellular components that have the ability to insert or repair the [ Fe-S ] clusters in TcuB in the absence of ApbC protein . 
Consistent with this interpretation , mutation of any of a number of genes involved in Fe or [ Fe-S ] cluster metabolism ( apbE , rseC , cyaY , gshA , iscU , iscA , fdx , hscAB , etc. ) abolished the growth of the apbC tcuC strain on tricarballylate medium ( data not shown ) . 
These studies emphasize the need for balance in the metabolic network and illustrate that accumulation and/or depletion of key metabolites can impact cellular function .
