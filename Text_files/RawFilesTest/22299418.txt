Abstract . 
One hundred and eighty-nine Salmonella isolates from swine were tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents , presence of dfrA12 and class 1 integrons containing dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 cassette . 
All isolates were multidrug resistant and exhibited highest resistance prevalence to trimethoprim ( 93 % ) . 
Most isolates ( 89 % ) were intl1-positive and 107 isolates ( 57 % ) carried dfrA12 , all of which were resistant to trimethoprim . 
Forty-eight dfrA12-harboring strains ( 45 % ) were intl1-positive together with dfrA12-aadA2 gene cassette . 
Fifteen isolates contained dfrA12 but not intl1 and dfrA12-aadA2 cassette . 
The results indicated a wide distribution of dfrA12 and its role in dissemination of trimethoprim resistance among Salmonella isolates from fattening pigs .

INTRODUCTION
Salmonella enterica plays an important role as food borne pathogen worldwide and food animals , including fattening pigs , are considered major reservoirs of this pathogen ( Hsu et al , 2006 ; Padungtod and Kaneene , 2006 ) . 
In the past two de-cades , antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella increasingly has emerged as a serious

The pathogen has become resistant to several drugs conventionally used for infection treatment including trimethoprim . 
This antibiotic in combination with sulphonamide drug has been widely used for both prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial diseases in swine production . 
Trimethroprim is an analog of dihydrofolate and competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) , which catalyses the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate in the DNA synthesis pathway ( Huovinen et al , 1995 ) . 
High trimethoprim resistance is most commonly due to overproduction of trime-throprim-resistant DHFR encoded by dfr . 
More than 30 DHFR have been described so far and are usually associated with integrons , mobile genetic elements , capable of capturing several resistance gene cassettes ( Skold , 2001 ) . 
Integrons are usually located on transposons and / or plasmids leading to an efficient horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria ( Collis and Hall , 1992 ) . 
A variety of dfr-containing gene cassettes have been identified in Salmonella ( Pei-rano et al , 2006 ) and different dfrs have been detected in isolates from different sources and regions ( Guerra et al , 2000 ; Chen et al , 2004 ) . 
Various dfr combinations have been identified in class 1 integrons , eg , dfrA16-aadA2 in isolates from food animals in Spain ( Riano et al , 2006 ) and dfrA1-aadA and dfrA17-aadA5 in isolates from humans in Hungary ( Nogrady et al , 2005 ) . 
In Thailand , previous studies have demonstrated that dfrA12 - aadA2 cassette is prevalent among isolates from poultry , pigs , pork and humans ( Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ; Wechsiri et al , 2011 ) . 
Pigs are the major food animals for people worldwide including Thailand and trimethoprim resistance is very common among the bacterial foodborne pathogens . 
However , epidemiology of dfrA12 has not hitherto been well studied . 
In this report , we investigated the prevalence of dfrA12 and its relationship to integrons in Salmonella isolates from fattening pigs . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , media and growth conditions One hundred and eighty-nine Salmo-nella isolates were obtained from clinically healthy fattening pigs and their farm environment in Chiang Mai and Lamphun Districts , Thailand during 2000-2006 . 
All strains were recovered by standard methods as previously described ( Hanson et al , 2002 ; Dorn-In et al , 2009 ) . 
Briefly , fecal and swab samples were inoculated into Rappaport and Vasilidis ( RVS ) broth and incubated overnight at 42ºC . 
A loop of inoculum from RVS broth was streaked on Brilliant Green ( BG ) agar and incubated for 24 hours at 37ºC . 
Two colonies with Salmonella appearance were selected from each plate and inoculated on triplesugar iron ( TSI ) agar . 
Colonies exhibiting an alkaline slant , an acid butt and H2O2 production were further examined for their biochemical characteristics . 
Only a single colony was collected from each positive sample and was stored in 20 % glycerol at -80 ºC . 
Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility Antimicrobial susceptibility to 6 antimicrobials : ceftiofur ( 30 µg ) , chlor-amphenicol ( 30 µg ) , enrofloxacin ( 5 µg ) , erythromycin ( 15 µg ) , gentamicin ( 10 µg ) and tetracycline ( 30 µg ) were determined using disk diffusion method ( NCCLS , 2002 ) . 
Susceptibility to 3 other antimicrobials , spectinomycin , streptomycin and trimethoprim was determined as minimum inhibitory concentration using a two-fold agar dilution technique ( NCCLS , 2002 ) . 
Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) was defined as an isolate being resistant to three or more different classes of anti-biotics . 
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29212 were used as control organisms . 
Detection of intl1 , dfrA12 and dfrA12-aadA2 The presence of intl1 was detected using either PCR or DNA dot-blot hy ¬ 
bridization . 
The primer set used for intl1 amplification was INT1F , 5 ' - AAGGATCGGGCCTTGAT-GTT-3 ' and INT1R , 5 ' - CAGCG-CATCAAGCGGTGAGC-3 ' ( Pongpech et al , 2008 ) . 
The intl1 insert in pCTF202 was labeled and used as probe for detection of inlt1 by dot-blot hybridization using random primed DNA labeling kit ( Roche , Mannhein , Germany ) ( Tribuddharat and Fennewald , 1999 ) . 
The presence of dfrA12 was examined by PCR using specific primers dfrA12-F , 5 ' - TT CGCAGACTCACTGAGGG-3 ' and dfrA12-R , 5 ' - CGGTTGAGA CAAGCTCGAAT-3 ' ( Chuanchuen and Padungtod , 2009 ) . 
The existence of dfrA12-aadA2 was determined using DNA dot-blot hybridization employing a labeled probe amplified with a primer pair of 5 ' - CS , 5 ' - GGCATC-CAAGCAGCAAG-3 ' and 3 ' - CS , 5 ' - AAGCAGACTTGACCTGA-3 ' from class 1 integrons ( Levesque et al , 1995 ) .

this study were multidrug resistant ( Fig 1 ) . 
Resistance frequency to chloramphenicol , erythromycin , gentamicin , tetracycline , spec-tinomycin , streptomycin and tri-methoprim was 58 , 98 , 14 , 90 , 87 , 63 and 93 % , respectively . 
All the isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur and enrofloxacin . 
Detection of intl1 , dfrA12 and dfrA12-aadA2 One hundred and sixty-nine isolates 
( 89 % ) were intl1-positive and 107 isolates ( 57 % ) were found to contain dfrA12 ( Fig 2 ) . 
All dfrA12-containing isolates exhibited resistance to trimethoprim . 
Of all intl1-positive Salmonella strains , 48 isolates ( 28 % ) harbored dfrA12-aadA2 cassette and 44 isolates ( 26 % ) carried dfrA12 without dfrA12-aadA2 cassette . 
Among the dfrA12-harboring strains , 48 isolates ( 45 % ) contained dfrA12-aadA2 cassette . 
Fifteen isolates ( 3 % ) contained dfrA12 but not intl1 .

DISCUSSION
All the Salmonella isolates in this study were resistant to multiple drugs , in agreement with previous reports in the isolates from food animals ( Randall et al , 2004 ; Riano et al , 2006 ; Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ) . 
This is most likely the result of the extensive and long-term use of antimicrobial agents in pig production for three main purposes : treatment of infection , prevention of disease and growth promotion . 
Resistance to trimethoprim was very common and high exposure to this antibiotic-selective pressure could be the reason . 
Ceftiofur resistance is currently a particular concern because it is closely related to ceftriaxone , a drug of choice for treatment of invasive Salmonella infections in children ( Fey et al , 2000 ) . 
However , resistance to ceftiofur was not observed among the strains in this study . 
Similarly , none of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin . 
The explanation could be the limited use of these two antibiotics in pig production . 
In this study , the widespread presence of dfrA12 was observed with a frequency that was higher than the previous study ( 47 % ) of isolates from poultry and pigs ( Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ) . 
All the dfrA12-carrying isolates were resistant to trimethoprim , indicating the association between dfrA12 and tri-methoprim resistance phenotype . 
However , it can not be concluded that dfrA12 is the only explanation for trimethoprim resistance in these isolates as several dfr genes and multidrug efflux systems have been previously characterized ( Eaves et al , 2004 ) . 
However , their contribution in trimethoprim resistance was not tested in this study . 
The dfrA12 gene is frequently found to be associated with class 1 integrons where it usually exists as dfrA12-orf-aadA2 cassette ( Hsu et al , 2006 ; Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ) . 
This is consistent with the present study showing that up to 45 % of dfrA12 were associated with dfrA12 - orf-aadA2 cassette . 
This resistance gene array was previously identified in class 1 integrons in food animal isolates in different countries , eg , cattle , pigs and poultry in Germany ( Miko et al , 2005 ) , poultry and pig in Thailand ( Khemtong and Ch-uanchuen , 2008 ) and pig in Taiwan ( Hsu et al , 2006 ) . 
Such resistance gene combination also has been isolated from other bacterial strains , eg , Escherichia coli ( Yang et al , 2009 ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii ( Gu et al , 2007 ) . 
The presence of a specific gene combination in different Salmonella serovars and different bacterial species from different animal hosts and different geographic area indicates horizontal transfer of the resistance gene cassette in the clinical settings ( Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ) . 
The dfrA12-orf-aadA2 cassette has been described previously on conjugative plasmids ( Khemtong and Chuanchuen , 2008 ) but horizontal transfer of dfrA12 was not examined in this study . 
Although dfrA12 has been shown to be combined predominantly with aadA2 , several studies have demonstrated different combination of dfr and aad , eg , dfrA1-aadA1 ( Miko et al , 2005 ) , dfrA16-aadA2 ( Riano et al , 2006 ) , dfrA14-aadA1a ( Guerra et al , 2000 ) , dfrA17-aadA5 ( Hsu et al , 2006 ) . 
It is still unclear of existence of a specific combination in a certain geographic area . 
The different antibiotic uses within geographically distinct regions could provide an explanation ( Khemtong and Chuan-chuen , 2008 ) . 
In summary , this study demonstrates the high prevalence of trimethoprimresistance encoding dfrA12 and its association with class 1 integrons among Salmonella isolates from fattening pigs . 
This confirmed that dfrA12 plays an important role in trimethoprim-resistance among the Salmonella isolates and reinforced that pigs serve as major carriers of mobile genetic elements carrying resistance determinants . 
Strategies to prevent distribution of antimicrobial resistance among pigs and also other food animals must be encouraged . 
The prudent use of antimicrobials in food animal production should be advised and discontinuation of the antimicrobial abuse in livestock is mandatory . 
Antimicrobial resistance monitoring and surveillance programs among bacteria from food animals should be routinely performed .
