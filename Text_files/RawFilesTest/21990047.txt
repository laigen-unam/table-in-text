Objectives : The aim of this study was to sequence the chromosomal region conferring resistance to ampicillin , streptomycin , sulphonamides and tetracycline ( R-type ASSuT ) in a Salmonella Typhimurium ( STM ) monophasic strain ( 4 , [ 5 ] ,12 : i :2 ) belonging to the PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 . 
The presence of this resistance region and the analysis of its genetic environment was investigated in a selection of strains . 
Methods : A Sau3A1 genomic library was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the genomic resistance region . 
PCRs were performed on 10 epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella strains , both STM and monophasic STM , with R-type ASSuT and PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 , in order to investigate the presence of the resistance genes , the left and right junctions and the internal regions of the resistance region , as well as the genetic environment . 
Results : The genomic resistance region consisted of two regions , resistance region 1 ( RR1 ) , conferring resist-ance to ampicillin , streptomycin and sulphonamides , and resistance region 2 ( RR2 ) , conferring tetracycline resistance . 
These resistance regions were both surrounded by IS26 elements and sequence comparative analysis showed 99 % sequence identity with a region of plasmid pO111_1 from an Escherichia coli strain . 
All 10 strains were positive for the four resistance genes , the left and right junctions and the internal regions of RR1 and RR2 . 
Concerning the genetic environment , all the strains lacked the STM1053-1997 and STM2694 genes , while only monophasic STM strains showed deletion of the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon . 
Conclusions : This study describes two resistance regions localized on the bacterial chromosome of a clonal lineage of STM and monophasic STM that are widespread in Italy . 
Keywords: Salmonella spp., MDR, resistance regions
Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance is quite common in Salmonella spp. , especially in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( STM ) and Salmonella enterica 4 , [ 5 ] ,12 : i :2 ( monophasic STM ) , an emer-ging serovar antigenically related to STM but lacking the secondphase ﬂagellar antigen encoded by the ﬂjB gene .1 In Italy , STM and monophasic STM have accounted for approximately 60 % of all Salmonella serovars isolated from human infections in recent years , with a high percentage of multidrug-resistant strains ( resistant to four or more drugs ) . 
Among these two serovars , most strains show the R-type ASSuT ( i.e. resistance to ampicillin , streptomycin , sulphona-mides and tetracycline ) and belong to a unique clonal lineage , mainly represented by the PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079.2 
It has been demonstrated that ASSuT strains isolated in different European countries harbour the same resistance genes [ blaTEM-1 , strA-strB , sul2 and tetA ( B ) ] 3 -- 5 and that these are located on the bacterial chromosome , thus suggesting the presence of a genomic resistance cluster .3 In order to clarify its organization , the entire chromosomal resistance region has been sequenced and its presence investigated in a selection of STM and monophasic STM strains with R-type ASSuT . 
In addition , analysis of the genetic environment of the region has been performed . 
Materials and methods
The nucleotide sequence of the genomic resistance region was determined , using a Sau3A1 genomic library , in a monophasic STM strain ( 105/7/03 , R-type ASSuT , PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 and phage type

U311 ) isolated in Italy in 2003 from a human case of gastroenteritis . 
In addition , 10 epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella strains , comprising 7 STM and 3 monophasic STM [ R-type ASSuT , PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 and various phage types ( U302 , U311 , 32 and NT ) ] , isolated in Italy between 2003 and 2010 , were tested by PCR for blaTEM , strA-strB , sul2 and tetA ( B ) genes , for the left and right junctions and for the internal region of the resistance cluster ( Table 1 ) . 
Moreover , the surrounding genetic environment of the resistance region , consisting of the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon , including the genes ﬂjA , ﬂjB and hin , and the genes STM1053-1997 , STM2692 , STM2694 , STM2740 , STM2741 , STM2757 , STM2758 , iroB and STM2774 , was analysed using the primers described by Soyer et al. .1 
Results and discussion
The nucleotide sequence ( Figure 1a ; GenBank accession no . 
HQ331538 ) harbours the ASSuT resistance genes , which are clustered into two regions [ resistance region 1 ( RR1 ) and resistance region 2 ( RR2 ) ] inserted in two adjacent loci of the chromosome , involved in polysaccharide transport and metabolism . 
In particular RR1 ( 8761 bp ) , conferring resistance to ampicillin , streptomycin and sulphonamides , was inserted in gene STM2753 , causing a deletion of 190 bp , while RR2 ( 14587 bp ) , conferring tetracycline resistance , was inserted in gene STM2759 , causing a deletion of 6 bp . 
The chromosomal fragment located between the two regions included the genes from STM2753D ′ ′ to STM2759D ′ ( 6543 bp ) , but inversely orientated . 
Comparison with the sequence database revealed that the chromosomal regions involved in the insertion were well conserved ; 100 % sequence identity was observed for the chromosomal segment upstream of RR1 ( STM2752 and STM2753D ′ ) while the region between RR1 and RR2 ( STM2759D ′ - STM2753D ′ ′ ) and the region downstream of RR2 ( STM2759D ′ ′ and STM2760 ) showed 99 % sequence identity with the complete STM LT2 genome ( GenBank accession no . 
AE006468 ) . 
RR1 interrupted the STM2753 gene and was composed of an IS26 element , a truncated Tn3 transposon containing the partial resolvase gene ( tnp3RD ) and the blaTEM-1 gene , followed by a tnpB gene and an IS26 element in the opposite orientation . 
Downstream , strB , strA and sul2 resistance genes , repC and repAD , partially encoding replication proteins of the RSF1010 plasmid , and , at the end , another IS26 element , were found . 
When compared with multidrug resistance clusters described previously , RR1 showed 99 % sequence identity with a region of the plasmid pO111_1 harboured in an Escherichia coli strain isolated in Japan in 2001 ( GenBank accession no . 
AP010961 ; nt 107040 -- 113069 ) . 
However , in RR1 the resistance gene blaTEM-1 , between two IS26 elements , was located upstream of IS26-repAD and inversely orientated ( Figure 1a ) . 
RR2 started with an IS26 element and a defective Tn10 transposon . 
This transposon included a truncated IS10-left transposase , lysRD , gltS2 , gltS1 , ydjA , ydjB and jemC genes , with hypothetical functions , tetR ( B ) and tetA ( B ) genes encoding the tetracycline repressor and resistance proteins , respectively , and a tetC ( B ) D gene . 
The Tn10 transposon was interrupted by the insertion of an IS1 element , which caused the deletion of the tetD ( B ) gene and IS10-right . 
Downstream , a partial Tn21 transposon included IRmer ( where IR stands for inverted repeat ) , the mercury resistance operon , and urf2 and tniAD1 genes , encoding a hypothetical protein and a putative transposase , respectively . 
The Tn21 transposon was interrupted , at its right side , by an IS26 element . 
RR2 also showed 99 % sequence identity with a region of the pO111_1 plasmid ( nt 92230 -- 105999 ) . 
Moreover , the Tn10 transposon of RR2 lacked the right terminal ( IS10-right ) , as in the pO111_1 plasmid , but our Tn10 was also truncated at the left terminal ( Figure 1a ) . 
Both RR1 and RR2 , as expected , lacked the aph gene , conferring resistance to kanamycin , present in the pO111_1 plasmid . 
Overall , the comparison of the entire sequence harbouring RR1 and RR2 with sequences of the pO111_1 plasmid and of the complete STM LT2 genome , showed seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and one frameshift , caused by a nucleotide deletion . 
Only two SNPs were non-synonymous substitutions , one in strA ( Arg175Gly ) and one in the STM2756 gene ( Gly107Asp ) . 
The frameshift , present in the gltS gene , led to the formation of a stop codon and a second start codon responsible for the formation of two hypothetical proteins , gltS1 and gltS2 . 
This frameshift has been reported previously in pHCM1 , a plasmid found in a Salmonella Typhi strain isolated in Vietnam in 1993 ( GenBank accession no . 
AL513383 ) , which showed a resistance cluster highly similar to an IncHI1 plasmid of Salmonella Paratyphi A , pAKU_1 , isolated from a Pakistani patient in 2002 ( GenBank accession no . 
AM412236 ) and to a 120 kb IncF plasmid pRSB107 , isolated from activated sludge bacteria in a sewage treatment plant in Germany ( GenBank accession no . 
AJ851089 ) . 
In addition , the 9 kb sequence , incorporating blaTEM-1 , sul2 and strA-strB , ﬂanked by IS26 elements , has been described in other STM strains , integrated in the chromosome ( GenBank accession no . 
AY524415 ) or on an IncF-like plasmid pU302L ( GenBank accession no . 
AY333434 ) . 
Finally , parts of RR1 and RR2 , such as the mer resistance operon , the blaTEM gene ﬂanked by two IS26 elements and the strA-strB gene , have also been described in variants of the Salmonella genomic island 1 ( ` SGI1 ' ) .6,7

The target regions are indicated in Figure 1 ( a ) . 
Analysis of the sequences ﬂanking all the IS26 elements allowed us to identify direct repeats ( DRs ) only upstream and downstream of the second IS26 ( CTTGATAT ; Figure 1a ) , suggesting a reminiscent transpositional event . 
Despite RR1 and RR2 being bracketed by two IS26 elements in direct orientation , the lack of DR elements suggested that their insertion occurred by multiple illegitimate recombination events , rather than through a transpositional mechanism , as previously described .6,7 In addition , the presence of IS26 elements may have contributed to the intrinsic instability of the resistance regions . 
All 10 strains investigated for the presence of blaTEM , strA-strB , sul2 and tetA ( B ) genes , RR1 and RR2 ( left , right and internal regions ; Figure 1a ) were positive for all the genes/regions tested , regardless of whether they were STM or monophasic STM . 
These results suggest that the genetic organization of the ASSuT chromosomal resistance regions is well conserved among Salmonella strains with PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 . 
The genetic environment of the RR1 and RR2 insertion regions has been reported to be frequently subjected to rearrangements and insertions .1 The lack of the chromosomal regions in STM2694-STM2740 , STM2758-STM2773 and STM2694-STM2771 , including the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon , responsible for the expression of the second ﬂagellar phase , has been reported in strains isolated in Spain and the USA .1 In contrast , when tested by PCR according to Soyer et al. ,1 all ASSuT strains of this study were found to be positive for the genes contained in the described regions , except for STM1053-1997 , an insertion region described only in US strains and STM2694 , a gene of the Fels-2 prophage . 
As expected , all the monophasic strains were found to lack ﬂjB and hin genes , and strain 105/7/03 also lacked the ﬂjA gene . 
A similar deletion genotype has been described only in one US strain , which seems quite different from all the other strains analysed by Soyer et al. 1 An analysis of the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon in the monophasic STM strains showed that the insertion of IS26 elements , as previously described ,8,9 is responsible for deletions in the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon ( Figure 1b ) ; in particular strain 57/7/03 lacked 727 bp , while the strains 40/17/03 and 2/29/09 lacked 694 bp , at the 5 ′ end of the ﬂjB gene , as a consequence of the IS26 insertion . 
As far as the sequenced strain , 105/7/03 , is concerned , the STM2769 gene and ﬂjA-ﬂjB-hin genes were , respectively , partially and completely deleted by an IS26 insertion . 
The chromosomal region downstream of the IS26 element was found to be conserved ; it restarted at the same nucleotide position of the intergenic region followed by the iroB gene in all strains . 
Overall , our study shows that ASSuT strains , which are wide-spread in Italy , both STM and monophasic STM , belonging to a unique clonal lineage , harbour two new genomic resistance regions that are highly conserved . 
The chromosomal integration of these regions , probably by illegitimate recombination , is of great concern since antimicrobial resistance in ASSuT strains could be maintained without selective pressure and could contribute to their spread in humans and animals . 
Finally , in strains belonging to PFGE proﬁle STYMXB .0079 we observed a high degree of conservation in the genomic resistance regions but greater variability in the ﬂjA-ﬂjB operon in the monophasic STM strains . 
These observations suggest that this operon could be an integration hotspot of acquired DNA . 
Further studies are needed to assess the presence of these resistance regions in a larger number of ASSuT strains belonging to the same or different clonal lineages circulating both in Italy and in other European countries .
