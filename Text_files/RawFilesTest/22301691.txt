Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes inﬂammation , necrosis , and diarrhea in pigs , as well as being an important source of food-borne diseases in humans . 
Probiotics and prebiotics are promising alternatives to antibiotics to control and prevent intestinal infections . 
The present work investigated a recently developed - galactomannan ( GM ) prebiotic compared to the proven probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on porcine ileum intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs ) of the IPI-2I line and monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) cocultured in vitro with Salmonella . 
We observed that both S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM inhibited the association of Salmonella with IECs in vitro . 
Our data indicated that GM has a higher ability than S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii to inhibit Salmonella-induced proinﬂammatory mRNA ( cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF - ] , interleukin-1 [ IL-1 ] , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ GM-CSF ] and chemokines CCL2 , CCL20 , and CXCL8 ) and at protein levels ( IL-6 and CXCL8 ) . 
Additionally , GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii induced some effects on DCs that were not observed on IECs : GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii showed slight upregulation of mRNA for TNF - , GM-CSF , and CCR7 receptor on porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) . 
Indeed , the addition of GM or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on DCs cocultured with Salmonella showed higher gene expression ( mRNA ) for TNF - , GM-CSF , and CXCL8 compared to that of the control with Salmonella . 
In conclusion , the addition of GM inhibits Salmonella-induced proinﬂammatory proﬁles in IECs but may promote DC activation , although associated molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated . 
Enteropathogenic Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative , facultative intracellular pathogen that causes inﬂammation and necrosis of the small and large intes-tines of pigs , resulting in diarrhea that may be accompanied by generalized sepsis . 
Although all ages are susceptible , the disease is more frequent in weaned and growing ﬁnishing pigs ( 22 ) . 
Moreover , in European countries , Salmonella Typhimurium is the serovar most frequently isolated from slaughter pigs , and is an important source of Salmonella infections in humans due to ingestion of contaminated food ( 12 ) . 
However , the reduction of food-borne human diseases must be coherent with the European ban on antibiotic growth promoters ( AGPs ) for animal feeding ( regulation [ EC ] no. 1831/2003 ) . 
AGPs have been implicated in increased on-farm prevalence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics . 
Such bacteria are considered to represent a health hazard owing to potential transfer of resistance to bacteria pathogenic to humans ( 41 ) . 
Probiotic and prebiotic feed additives are promising alternatives to AGPs because they inﬂuence the intestinal microbiota , reducing colonization by pathogenic bacteria and enhancing the mucosal immune system ( 14 ) . 
Our work presents in vitro screening of a novel prebiotic rich in - galactomannan ( GM ) and developed from the carob bean of the Ceratonia silliqua tree , in comparison with the proven probiotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var . 
boulardii . 
For a review of the proven beneﬁcial effects of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii in the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases , see reference 44 . 
We studied the effects of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on porcine intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs ) and dendritic cells ( DCs ) , which are crucial to maintain gut homeostasis and to develop strong immune responses against pathogens such as Salmonella ( 9 , 33 ) . 
In order to support the development of effective prebiotics and probiotics in animal production , we characterized the ability of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
bou-lardii to inhibit Salmonella association with IECs , the cytokine and chemokine regulation induced by Salmonella in IECs and DCs , and the modulatory effects of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on both cell types cocultured with the pathogen . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
IEC culture . 
The porcine small intestine epithelial cell line IPI-2I ( ECACC 93100622 ) was established from the ileum of an adult boar ( SLAd/d haplotype ) ( 17 ) . 
IPI-2I cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modiﬁed Eagle 's me-dium ( DMEM ) - GlutaMAX ( Invitrogen , Spain ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Invitrogen ) and 10 g/ml insulin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Saint-Quentin , France ) . 
In all experiments , cells were cultured in 6-well plates ( Nunc , Labclinics , Spain ) to conﬂuence . 
For scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , cells were grown onto a coverslip placed inside the well to allow removal of the monolayer . 
Before the addition of pre - or probiotics and/or infection , cells were washed three times , and the cell culture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10 g/ml insulin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
Cells were used between passages 30 and 70 and periodically tested to avoid Mycoplasma contamination ( MycoAlert Mycoplasma detection kit ; Lonza ) . 
Probiotic and prebiotic preparation . 
Lyophilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( Biocodex , Laboratoires Montrouge , France ) was rehydrated with 10 ml of DMEM-GlutaMAX and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C . 
The yeast cells were then counted with a Neubauer cell counter with methyl blue to exclude nonviable yeast cells . 
The yeast cells were added to the selected wells at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 3 and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 10 % CO2 . 
Prebiotic GM ( Salmosan ; patent WO2009/144070 A2 , licensed to Industrial Técnica Pecuaria , ITPSA , Barcelona , Spain ) consists of a - ( 1 -- 4 ) - mannose backbone with branched galactose molecules ( 1:4 galactose / mannose ratio ) ( 38 ) . 
For these in vitro experiments , GM was diluted in DMEM-GlutaMAX ( 1 mg/ml ) , vortexed , and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C . 
Immediately before the Salmonella infection , GM was added to each well at 10 g/ml . 
Host cell-pathogen assay . 
Pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella ) with antigenic formulae 4,12 : i :1,2 and resistant to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfonamide , and tetracycline was provided by Ignacio Badiola , Centre Recerca en Sanitat Animal ( CReSA ; IRTA-UAB , Bellaterra , Spain ) . 
Aliquots of Salmonella were provided in bacterial cryopreservers ( Technical Service Consultants , Ferrer International , Spain ) and stored at 80 °C until use . 
Before infection of DCs or IECs , a single Salmonella cryopreserver was added to 20 ml of Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium and cultured for 3 to 4 h at 37 °C with 180 rpm rotational agitation ( Multitron HT ; Infors ) . 
For the infection , Salmonella was used during the exponential growth phase , as determined by absorbance at 600 nm ( A600 ) . 
Salmonella was used at an MOI of 4 , as previously determined by cytotoxic lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assays ( Roche Applied Science , Spain ) ( data not shown ) . 
The optimal time of coculture was previously determined by proinﬂammatory gene expression and protein secretion ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , in vitro challenge lasted 3 h for gene expression and bacterial adherence studies and 24 h for supernatant cytokine determination . 
After host cell-pathogen coculture , cells or supernatants were , respectively , sampled and stored until analysis . 
Cell-associated bacterial experiment . 
Inhibition of Salmonella adherence and invasion was assessed on IECs grown to conﬂuence and incubated with Salmonella ( MOI of 4 ) , with and without S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii or GM , for 3 h . 
After the host-pathogen assay , supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) to eliminate all nonadherent bacteria . 
Cells were then homogenized with 1 ml of

0.1 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 15 min . 
This solution was serially diluted in PBS , and 100 l ( dilution , 1 10 4 ) was plated in LB agar petri dishes for 24 h at 37 °C to count the CFU . 
The ability of Salmonella to infect IPI-2I cells was quantiﬁed as cell-associated bacteria ( adhering and intracellular ) , calculated as follows : % cell-associated bacteria [ ( adhered and intracellular salmonellae on IPI-21 cells ) / ( total salmonellae added/well ) ] 100 . 
To determine differences between experimental treatments , the relative percentage of cell-associated bacteria was calculated as % relative cell-associated bacteria ( % ) [ ( CFU/ml treatment ) / ( CFU/ml control infection ) ] 100 . 
SEM . 
Preventive anti-Salmonella adherent abilities of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM on IECs were visualized by SEM . 
The IPI-2I cell culture was prepared as previously described by Mitjans and Ferrer ( 24 ) , except that cells were ﬁxed in cacodylate buffer ( 0.1 M [ pH 7.4 ] ) . 
The samples were examined in a Zeiss DSM 940A ( Oberkochen , Germany ) electronic microscope , operating at 15 kV . 
Samples were processed and examined at the Scientiﬁc and Technological Centers of the University of Barcelona . 
Isolation of mRNA and cDNA synthesis . 
Cells were homogenized using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and total RNA was isolated using Purelink RNA minikit ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The RNA concentration was determined by measuring optical density at 260 nm ( OD260 ) , and the RNA quality was assessed by calculating OD260/OD280 . 
The samples of RNA were then treated with the DNase I ampliﬁcation-grade kit ( Sigma-Aldrich ) ( 1 U / g of RNA ) . 
A total of 1 g of RNA was used to generate cDNA by using the Transcriptor high-ﬁdelity cDNA synthesis kit ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Brieﬂy , 1 g of RNA was incubated in a ﬁnal volume of 20 l containing 2 l deoxynucleoside triphosphate ( dNTP ) ( ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM each ) , 1 l oligo ( dT ) ( 2.5 M ) , 1.1 l Transcriptor high-ﬁdelity reverse transcriptase ( 10 U / l ) , 4 l 5 Transcriptor highﬁdelity reverse transcriptase buffer , and 1 l of dithiothreitol ( DTT ; 5 mM ) and completed with ultrapure water . 
The reaction was maintained for 30 min at 45 °C and then heat inactivated at 85 °C for 10 min . 
The generated cDNA was stored at 80 °C until analysis . 
mRNA expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR . 
The mRNA and primer sequences used in this study have been published ( 5 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 42 ) . 
These primers allowed the mRNA expression analysis of various genes involved in the innate immune response ( Table 1 ) . 
Quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) was performed using 2 l of cDNA synthesized as previously described combined with primer/probe sets and IQ SYBR green supermix ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
Each qPCR included a reverse transcription negative control ( RNA sample without reverse transcriptase ) to check the absence of genomic DNA . 
The qPCR conditions were 98 °C for 30 s , followed by 37 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing/elongation for 30 s ( at the annealing temperatures shown in Table 1 ) . 
Real-time assays were run on a BioRad iQ5 . 
The speciﬁcity of the qPCRs was assessed by analyzing the melting curves of the products and size veriﬁcation of the amplicons . 
To minimize sample variation , we used identical numbers of cells and high-quality RNA . 
Samples were normalized internally using simultaneously the average cycle threshold ( Cq ) ( 7 ) of genes coding for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( HPRT1 ) , ribosomal protein L19 ( RPL19 ) , and TATA box binding protein 1 ( TBP-1 ) as reference genes in each sample to avoid any artifact of variation in the target gene . 
We used these three reference genes given their stability in porcine cells ( 5 , 13 ) determined using calculated geNorm application ( 36 ) . 
A standard curve was generated using diluted cDNA . 
The correlation coefﬁcients of the standard curves were 0.995 , and the concentrations of the test samples were calculated from the standard curves , according to the formula y M Cq B , where M is the slope of the curve , Cq is the point during the exponential phase of ampliﬁcation at which the ﬂuorescent signal is ﬁrst recorded as being statistically signiﬁcant above background , and B is the y-axis intercept . 
Cq values were used to calculate the qPCR efﬁciency from the given slope according to the equation qPCR efﬁciency [ 10 ( 1/M ) 1 ] 100 . 
All qPCRs displayed efﬁciency between 90 % and 110 % and were performed following MIQE guidelines ( 7 ) . 
Expression data are expressed as relative values after Genex macroanalysis with three reference genes ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) ( 36 ) . 
Determination of cytokine production . 
Cytokine protein determination in the culture supernatant was performed by enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assays ( ELISAs ) . 
After 3 h of host cell-pathogen assay performed as described above , 75 g/ml of gentamicin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) was added to each well to avoid bacterial overgrowth . 
Cell culture supernatant was collected after 24 h and stored at 80 °C until analysis . 
Swine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and CXCL8 DuoSet ELISA kits ( R&D Systems , Vitro SP , Spain ) were used according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
Isolation of PBMCs and differentiation of monocyte derived dendritic cells . 
Blood samples were obtained from 6 - to 12-month-old large white pigs at the slaughterhouse . 
Blood was collected into heparinized tubes and followed the protocol described by Pilon et al. ( 27 ) , with a few modiﬁcations . 
Brieﬂy , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by centrifugation ( 1,000 g for 30 min ) over Ficoll ( density 1.077 ; Histopaque , Sigma-Aldrich , France ) . 
Red blood lysing solution ( Sigma-Aldrich ) was used to remove remaining erythrocytes . 
Cells were then resuspended in RPMI-GlutaMAX ( Gibco , Invitrogen ) containing 2.5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin -- streptomycin , and 50 M 2 - - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
Next , 150 106 cells/20 ml were plated in 150-cm2 cellBind ﬂasks ( Corning , Afora , Spain ) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5 % CO2.Then , the ﬂasks were washed with RPMI to remove all nonadherent cells ( lymphocytes ) . 
To induce differentiation , monocytes were cultured with RPMI-GlutaMAX medium containing 1 % penicillin -- streptomycin antibiotic , 10 % FBS , 50 M - mercaptoethanol , and swine recombinant cytokines IL-4 ( 100 ng/ml ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ; 20 ng/ml ) ( Biosource , Invitrogen ) for 6 days at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 . 
On day 3 , fresh medium and cytokines were added at the same concentrations used previously . 
DC phenotyping . 
After 6 days of culture , cells showed typical DC morphology . 
In addition , DCs were characterized as CD172a ( SWC3 ) , swine leukocyte antigen ( SLA ) class II-DQ , swine leukocyte antigen

FIG 1 Cell-associated Salmonella on IECs in the presence of GM or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( Scb ) . 
Adherence and/or invasion of Salmonella on IECs cocultured with GM ( A ) or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( B ) is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner . 
Data ( n 5 ) are expressed as mean percentages standard deviations ( SDs ) . 
Columns within each histogram with no common superscripts are signiﬁcantly different ( P 0.05 ) . 
( SLA ) class II-DR , CD80/86 , CD14mod , and CD11R1 . 
Antibodies for cell surface markers CD172a/SWC3 , SLA class II-DQ , SLA class II-DR , and CD11R1 were provided by J. Domínguez ( INIA , Madrid , Spain ) . 
Antibody for CD14 determination was purchased from Acris Antibodies ( AntibodyBCN , Barcelona , Spain ) , and for CD80/CD86 , we used recombinant human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 / Fc fusion protein ( CTLA4-Fc IgG1 ; Invitrogen ) . 
The ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin IgG1 or Zenon tricolor mouse IgG1 and IgG2a labeling kits ( Invitrogen ) were used for detection by ﬂow cytometry ( FACSCanto using FACSDiva software ; BD Biosci-ences , San José , CA ) . 
Pathogen-induced dendritic cell activation . 
After 6 days of culture , DCs were recovered and adjusted to 5 105 to 1 106 DCs/well in 24-well plates . 
Optimal pathogen-induced activation was previously determined by proinﬂammatory gene expression by qPCR ( data not shown ) . 
DCs were then incubated with GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boular-dii , respectively , and challenged with Salmonella ( MOI of 4 ) . 
After 3 h of exposure , supernatants were discarded and cells were collected in TRIzol reagent . 
Isolation of DC mRNA and gene expression studies were performed as described above . 
Statistical analysis . 
All statistical analyses were performed using the General Linear Model Procedure ( PROC GLM ) of SAS software version 9.1.3 ( SAS Institute , Carey , NC ) . 
Means for cell-associated bacterial percentages , mRNA , and protein secretion were considered in a 2-by-3 factorial design ( two infection levels 3 experimental treatments ) with Duncan 's posttest for grouping analysis . 
The probability value P 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant . 
On the ﬁgures , superscript letters are used to designate statistical signiﬁcance : mean values with no common superscript letters indicate a statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P 0.05 ) , and mean values with the same superscript letters indicate no statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P 0.05 ) . 
RESULTS
Determination of cell-associated bacteria . 
Cell-associated bacteria on IECs were measured to assess the ability of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM to bind to Salmonella , as an indicator of the potential of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM to inhibit Salmo-nella colonization of the intestinal tract . 
The coculture of Salmo-nella ( 4 106 CFU ) and IECs ( 1 106 cells/well ) showed that approximately 45 % of added salmonellae became cell associated ( data not shown ) . 
The presence of GM ( 10 g/ml ) ( Fig. 1A ) or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( MOI of 3 ) ( Fig. 1B ) signiﬁcantly inhibited Salmonella association to around 50 % of control values ( P 0.001 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . 
These optimal doses of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii or GM were chosen for the following assays . 
Scanning electronic microscopy . 
SEM images of IECs infected with Salmonella conﬁrm bacterial attachment to the cell surface ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The images also reveal that GM mainly shows a spherical structure ( Fig. 2D ) with salmonellae attached to the surface and thus reducing the density in surrounding bacteria adhered to the epithelium ( Fig. 2E to F ) . 
Regarding the incubation with S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii , the yeast appears with its characteristic ovoid structure ( Fig. 2B and C ) . 
In this case , there is also a reduction in the surrounding attached bacteria due to the concentration of microorganisms near the yeast . 
Cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression on IECs . 
To assess the preventive effect of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM on the early immune response to Salmonella , we studied the mRNA expression of several proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemo-kines . 
The Salmonella coculture induced a large upregulation in mRNA levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines compared to controls without Salmonella ( Fig. 3 ) ( P 0.001 ) for tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ; 22.6-fold ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ; 4.5-fold ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ; 5-fold ) , and IL-6 ( 6-fold ) , as well as for chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) ligand 8 ( CXCL8 ; 7-fold ) , chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ( CCL2 ; 5.7-fold ) , and CCL20 ( 7.2-fold ) . 
Despite there being no statistically signiﬁcant differences , there was a slight increase in expression of chemokine CXCL10 ( 1.48-fold ) , whereas CCL21 tended to decrease ( P 0.07 , 2-fold decrease ) after Salmonella coculture . 
FIG 2 Interaction of Salmonella with GM or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on the surface of IPI-2I cells assessed by scanning electron microscopy . 
Images show Salmonella attachment on control IPI-2I cells ( A ) , Salmonella with S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( B and C ) , control GM ( D ) , and Salmonella with GM ( E and F ) . 
The addition of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii or GM did not induce proinﬂammatory effects per se compared to control cells ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Indeed , GM showed a slight anti-inﬂammatory effect ( 2-fold decreases ) for GM-CSF , IL-1 , IL-6 , and CCL20 compared to control cells ( P 0.05 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
We observed up to 70 % inhibition of Salmonella-induced mRNA expression of TNF - , GM-CSF , and CCL20 in IECs treated with 10 g/ml GM ( P 0.001 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Furthermore , gene expression of IL-1 , IL-6 , CCL2 , and CXCL8 was between 1.5 - and 3-fold-decreased in GM-treated cells compared to the Salmonella control . 
Likewise , the addition of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii induced between 2.6-and 1.4-fold inhibition of Salmonella-induced mRNA for the TNF - , GM-CSF , CXCL8 , and CCL2 genes ( P 0.05 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . 
However , no signiﬁcant differences were observed for IL-1 , IL-6 , and CCL20 in S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii-treated cells compared to the Salmonella control ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Cytokine production . 
The preventive effect of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on the Salmonella-induced proinﬂammatory IEC response was evaluated by the determination of secreted cytokine IL-6 and chemokine CXCL8 , determined by ELISA 24 h after infection . 
The addition of GM did not induce proinﬂammatory effects ( Fig. 4 ) . 
However , secretion of IL-6 was upregulated ( 1.5-fold ; P 0.05 ) in S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii-treated cells , but no changes were observed for CXCL8 . 
Coculture with Salmonella triggered up to 3-fold upregulation for IL-6 concentration ( P 0.01 ) ( Fig. 4A ) and 1.4-fold increase for CXCL8 ( Fig. 4B ) compared to control wells . 
Salmonella-induced secretion of IL-6 and CXCL8 was 38 % ( Fig. 4A ) and 20 % inhibited , respectively , in GM-treated cells compared to the Salmonella group ( P 0.05 ) ( Fig. 4B ) . 
On the other hand , coculture of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii before Salmonella infection did not prevent reduced Salmonella-induced secretion of IL-6 and CXCL8 ( Fig. 4A and B ) . 
Modulation of mRNA expression of porcine monocyte-derived DCs . 
Modulation of DCs by S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM was studied by mRNA gene expression in DCs after Salmo-nella coculture . 
We observed Salmonella-induced mRNA upregulation for TNF - ( 10-fold ) , GM-CSF ( 100-fold ) , Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ; 1.7-fold ) , CCR7 ( 2.3-fold ) , IL-6 ( 38.5-fold ) , CXCL8 ( 8.4-fold ) , CCL17 ( 2-fold ) , and IL-10 ( 12-fold ) genes compared to the control DCs ( P 0.001 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The highest upregulation for these proinﬂammatory cytokines , chemokines , and immune-related receptors was obtained with Salmonella at an MOI of 5 ( data not shown ) . 
A near-signiﬁcant trend ( P 0.06 ) was observed for other genes , such as A proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) and B-cell activating factor ( BAFF ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Both S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii and GM induced upregulation of the TNF - ( 2.5-fold ) , GM-CSF ( 3-fold and 6-fold , respectively ) and CCR7 ( 1.7-fold ) genes compared to untreated DCs ( P 0.05 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The coculture with GM or S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii increased between 1.5 - and 2.3-fold Salmonella-induced mRNA for TNF - , GM-CSF , CXCL8 , and IL-10 compared to the Salmonella-challenged DCs ( Fig. 5 ) ( P 0.05 ) . 
However , this effect was not observed for CCR7 , TLR4 , and CCL17 ( Fig. 5 ) . 
FIG 3 Effects of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( Scb ) and GM on cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression in IECs cultured with Salmonella . 
IECs ( 1 106 cells/well ) were cocultured with S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii ( 3 yeast cells/cell ) or GM ( 10 g/ml ) with Salmonella ( MOI of 4 ) for 3 h. Data ( n 6 ) are presented as means of mRNA relative expression SDs . 
Columns within each histogram with no common superscripts are signiﬁcantly different ( P 0.05 ) .

DISCUSSION
Developing probiotic and prebiotic alternatives to AGPs is especially challenging in the area of prevention of intestinal infections , particularly Salmonella and Escherichia coli ( 6 ) . 
Prebiotics and probiotics are believed to combat pathogens using less costly resources , reducing the drain on energy due to innate immune responses ( 3 ) , and modulating IEC and DC functionality ( 14 ) , thus helping to preserve gut homeostasis . 
The spread of Salmonella from the intestinal lumen to other host tissues mainly occurs in Peyer 's patches ( PP ) of the distal ileum , through compromised M cells , via enterocytes , or through the DC dendrites of the follicle-associated epithelium ( FAE ) ( 34 ) , causing a huge proinﬂammatory proﬁle in IECs and DCs . 
These cells orchestrate a rapid innate immune response to conﬁne invading bacteria and to prevent Salmonella dissemination to other tissues ( see references 10 and 11 for review ) . 
Besides constituting a physical barrier , IECs sense pathogens through pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , such as Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) , and secrete several signaling cytokines and chemokines ( 11 ) . 
Arce et al. ( 2 ) showed that recognition of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) by TLR4 of intestinal IPI-2I cells increases proinﬂammatory mRNA for TNF - and CXCL8 ( neutrophil recruitment ) and slightly upregulates CCL2 ( monocyte chemotaxis ) . 
The present data update our knowledge about IEC response after Salmonella exposure . 
We detected that Salmonella also induces an important mRNA proinﬂammatory response in IECs , involving IL-1 , IL-6 ( acute-phase reactions , proliferation , and differentiation of mac-rophages and B cells ) , GM-CSF ( proliferation and activation of neutrophils and macrophages ) , and a trend for CXCL10 , which is a potent chemoattractant of Th1-type CD4 and NK cells . 
These results conﬁrm mucosal immune orientation toward a Th1 response related to STAT-4 transcription factor after Salmonella infection assessed in the porcine in vivo intestinal gut loop model ( 22 ) . 
Furthermore , challenged IECs enhance immature DC che-motaxis ( upregulation of CCL20 ) versus the mature DC response ( downregulation of CCL21 ) to promote bacterial uptake across the epithelial barrier . 
Additionally , our data show that Salmonella induces an activated phenotype of porcine monocyte-derived DCs , as shown for the expression of CCR7 receptor and several proinﬂammatory cytokines ( TNF - , IL-6 , and GM-CSF ) and chemokines ( CXCL8 and CCL17 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . 
However , no changes were observed for A proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) and B-cell activating factor ( BAFF ) , which in humans are related to direct modulation of the local immunoglobulin A switch and enhanced B-cell survival and proliferation , respectively ( 20 ) . 
In our study , GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii showed different immune modulatory abilities when IECs and DCs were infected with Salmonella . 
We observed that GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii behave differently with respect to inhibition of Salmonella-induced mRNA and secretion of proteins containing genes involved in inﬂammation ( TNF - , GM-CSF , IL-1 , and IL-6 ) and recruitment/activation of immune cells ( CXCL8 , CCL2 , CXCL10 , and CCL20 ) . 
The anti-inﬂammatory properties of the probiotic S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii have been related to the secretion of small molecules ( 10 kDa ) that interfere with phosphor-ylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) , and p38 , inhibiting nuclear factor B ( NF - B ) transcription factor , which regulates the expression of proinﬂammatory genes in human colonic T-84 cells cocultured with Salmonella ( 21 ) and porcine intestinal epi-thelial cells of the IPEC-1 line upon enterotoxigenic E. coli F4 ( K88 ) in vitro infection ( 42 ) . 
Our data are partially in agreement with those of Martins et al. ( 21 ) describing inhibitory effects of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on Salmonella-induced mRNA for CXCL8 in T-84 cells . 
However , we observed a reduced anti-inﬂammatory effect of S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii on IECs cocultured with Sal-monella . 
Indeed , GM has higher inhibitory effects on Salmonella-induced mRNA ( TNF - , IL-1 , and IL-6 ) and protein IL-6 and CXCL8 secretion compared to S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii . 
To our knowledge , few data suggest direct modulation of proin-ﬂammatory gene expression by mannan polysaccharides ( 25 ) . 
Nevertheless , their anti-inﬂammatory effects are mainly related to the prevention of pathogen adhesion and invasion , as discussed below . 
Present results for cell-associated bacteria and SEM images for IECs describe how GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii interact with Salmonella and reduce pathogen attachment and invasion of porcine intestinal epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner . 
Previous studies in our laboratory showed that GM and S. cerevi-siae var . 
boulardii also block pathogenic E. coli attachment on IPI-2I cells ( 2a ) in a similar way to other commercially available galactoligosaccharides , using Caco-2 and Hep-2 cells ( 32 ) . 
These previous data also conﬁrmed the preventive properties of S. cerevi-siae var . 
boulardii against E. coli infections ( 43 ) , related to species-or strain-speciﬁc effects of Saccharomyces yeasts ( 35 ) . 
Entero-pathogenic species of Salmonella and E. coli share a type I ﬁmbria or pilus structure that contains multiple subunits of bacterial lec-tins that bind to mannan units of the glycoproteins on the surface of host cells ( 1 , 8 , 30 ) . 
As a source of mannans , GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii may mimic the host cell receptor to which the pathogen adheres ( 32 , 39 ) . 
In that sense , Searle et al. ( 28 , 29 ) showed that nondigestible oligosaccharides ( NDOs ) such as ga-lactoligosaccharides reduce Salmonella in vitro adhesion and invasion in the human colonic HT-29-19A cell line and also in the ileum gut loop model in mice . 
Furthermore , S. cerevisiae var . 
bou-lardii has already been described to bind Salmonella on its surface ( 15 ) , thus preserving intestinal barrier function through inhibition of pathogen adhesion and invasion of T-84 cells ( 21 ) . 
Together , these data suggest that products rich in mannanoligosaccharides , such as GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii , may have prophylactic roles against porcine pathogens bearing type I ﬁmbriae ( 4 ) . 
The ability of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii to modulate DC maturation directly correlates with previous published data ( 40 ) indicating that their role in immune regulation is related to the structure and size of mannans or - glucans ( 40 ) . 
The present study shows that Salmonella-induced maturation is slightly enhanced in GM-treated DCs compared to the control group for some of the studied genes ( coding for TNF - , IL-6 , CXCL8 , and IL-10 ) . 
We hypothesize that GM may modify Salmonella structures or antigens , and this might increase their recognition by PRRs of DCs . 
In contrast to our data , mannan-coated structures have been described ( 31 ) to activate TLR4 signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner in murine DCs , triggering the expression of costimulatory molecules CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 and leading to an mRNA upregulation for IL-1 - and TNF - cytokines among other Th1/Th2 cytokines . 
Since no differences were observed in TLR4 gene expression of DCs treated with S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii or GM , we alternatively propose C-type lectin receptors ( CLRs ) expressed on DCs , such as mannose receptor ( MR ) or dectin-2 ( 16 ) , which have high afﬁnity for mannose res-idues and are associated with the Th17 response ( 37 ) against intracellular pathogens ( 18 ) for the recognition of mannan-coated structures that lead to DC activation and maturation . 
Further studies may determine the contribution of C-type lectin receptors , especially MR , to sense mannan-coated structures upon Salmo-nella infection . 
To elucidate further possible modes of actions of GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii in animal production , the biological relevance of these in vitro results may be characterized by future research approaches -- for example , three-dimensional coculture ( 45 ) or gut loop intestinal models ( 22 ) -- to establish the cross talk of IECs , DCs , and other cell types involved in mucosal immune responses , such as monocytes/macrophages , neutro-phils , and intraepithelial lymphocytes . 
In conclusion , this study demonstrates that prebiotic GM and probiotic S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii interact with Salmonella . 
The prebiotic GM has higher anti-inﬂammatory properties in IECs cocultured with Salmonella compared to the proven S. cerevi-siae var . 
boulardii probiotic . 
The present work also provides some evidence about how GM and S. cerevisiae var . 
boulardii may modulate DC maturation directly and also when faced with Sal-monella infection . 
These studies provide some interesting data about the in vitro effect of prebiotic GM and probiotic S. cerevi-siae var . 
boulardii , both considered as natural alternatives to AGPs in combatting Salmonella infection .
