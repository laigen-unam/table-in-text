and even for the rest of the world . 
However , there are no descriptions , as yet , of the innate immune response to SE among Chinese chicken lines . 
Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) have recently emerged as major components of the pattern recognition receptor system that detects invading pathogens . 
It does so by virtue of a series of conserved molecular structures known as pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) ( Medzhitov and Janeway , 1997 ; Akira , 2004 ) . 
Recognition of PAMPs by TLRs reinforces both the innate and adaptive immune responses , causing prompt , speciﬁc response against pathogens ( Werling and Jungi , 2003 ) . 
Broader expression proﬁles of the TLR repertoire have been reported in heterophils of White Leghorn birds , implying a role in pathogen recognition ( Kogut et al. , 2005 ) . 
However the expression proﬁles of TLRs in other indigenous chicken lines have yet to be studied . 
Activation of the innate immune system is characterized by the production of inﬂammatory cytokines . 
Cytokines are an integral part of the immune response to Salmonella in avian species of infection ( Swaggerty et al. , 2006 ) . 
These cytokines are inﬂammatory e.g. , interleukin 1b ( IL-1b ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , and transforming growth factor-b4 ( TGF-b4 ) , and chemokines e.g. , CXCLi2 . 
Chicken IL-6 has been shown to have functions similar to those of its mammalian counterparts , including a role in proinﬂammatory responses ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ) . 
Infection with bacterial patho-gens causes changes in the expression of TGF-b4 by chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and heterophils ( Kogut et al. , 2003 ; Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) . 
Chemokines ar grouped into four structural families , CXC , CC , C , and CX3C . 
More than 20 chemokines have been identiﬁed in the chicken genome ( Kaiser et al. , 2005 ; DeVries et al. , 2006 ) . 
In the present study , we evaluated the effect on PBMCs among Chinese chicken lines on in vitro exposure to SE , examining the expression levels of mRNA of proinﬂammatory cytokines ( IL-1b and IL-6 ) , anti-inﬂammatory cytokine ( TGF-b4 ) , chemokines ( CXCLi2 and CCLi2 ) and some of toll-like receptors ( TLR4 , TLR5 and TLR15 ) .

We examined mRNA expression of eight genes , TLR4 , TLR5 , TLR15 , interleukin ( IL ) -1 b , IL-6 , transforming growth factor-b4 ( TGF-b4 ) , CXCLi2 , and a macrophage inﬂammatory protein ( MIP ) family chemokine called CCLi2 , in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) isolated from the blood of chickens after in vitro exposure to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) . 
The chickens of four Chinese native lines , Qingjiaoma , Sanhuang , Wugu , and Xueshanma , were evaluated for mRNA expression levels at 2 and 4 h post-infection using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . 
TLR4 and TLR15 mRNA were in particular highly expressed in PBMCs of Wugu and Xueshanma chickens exposed to SE , while TLR5 was expressed less in the Sanhuang chickens than in others . 
Breed effect was signiﬁcant ( P < 0.05 ) for IL-1b , IL-6 , CXCLi2 , and CCLi2 mRNA expression , all of which were expressed to a greater extent in Wugu and Xueshanma than in the other two lines . 
These ﬁndings demonstrate the difference of mRNA expression proﬁles for innate immune molecules in PBMCs infected to SE among different lines .

Introduction 
Salmonella contamination of poultry products is a global threat to public health ( Rabsch et al. , 2001 ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE ) was recently identiﬁed as the most common cause of food poisoning in China ( Ran et al. , 2011 ) . 
Lu et al. ( 2011 ) conducted an examination of chicken hatcheries , ﬂocks , and slaughterhouses in China and 57.2 % of their samples were positive for SE . 
Yang et al. ( 2010 ) conducted a similar study of SE isolates from chicken and other foods and found that 77.0 % were resistant to one or more antimicrobial drugs . 
This suggests a need for new ways of increasing resistance to SE . 
In general , the innate immune system plays an important role in early response to Salmonella , with a wide range of variation in the observed responses ( Kramer et al. , 2001 ; Kaiser et al. , 2006 ; Cheeseman et al. , 2007 ; MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Redmond et al. , 2009 ) . 
An improved understanding of the host innate immune response to SE would provide more options for reducing pathogen contamination of poultry products . 
China has a wealth of chicken genetic resources with more than 80 different indigenous chicken breeds . 
These resources could provide valuable breeding material for the poultry industry in China

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental chickens
A total of 20 chickens , 5 each from the Qingjiaoma , Sanhuang , Wugu , and Xueshanma layer lines , were purchased from the Changzhou Lihua Livestock Co. Ltd. ( Changzhou , China ) . 
Chickens were routinely tested for the absence of Salmonella . 
All birds were housed and handled following approval by the Institutional Animal Experimental Committee . 
2.2. Cell collection, culture, and SE exposure
Blood samples were taken from 20 birds ( 5 per line ) at eight weeks of age . 
Whole blood ( 3 ml ) was collected from jugular vein of each bird into a syringe with 10 % EDTA in 10:1 ( V : V ) ratio . 
The blood samples were combined within line in random pools of ﬁve each , to ensure isolation of an adequate quantity of PBMCs for various assays . 
Each blood pool was centrifuged for 10 min at 200g . 
The erythrocyte pellet was resuspended with PBS , then layered onto 1077 Histopaque ( 10771 , Sigma ) and centrifuged at 400g for 30 min . 
Mononuclear cells were collected from the gradient interface , washed with PBS , and centrifuged for 10 min at 200g . 
A ﬁnal wash was performed with antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen , U.S. ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen , U.S. ) . 
The pellets were then resuspended in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 with FBS . 
Cell viability and number were determined by trypan blue exclusion . 
Cells from each blood pool were plated into 24-well plates at 1 107/ml in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 . 
A poultry isolate of Salmonella subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis ( SE , 50041 ) in log growth phase was washed twice with PBS and with antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 , respectively , and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 1 109 cfu/ml . 
Either 100 ll of SE or culture medium was added to each well after overnight culture of the PBMCs . 
The PBMCs were then harvested at 2 and 4 h post exposure ( Kaiser et al. , 2000 ) . 
There were three wells per blood pool per exposure treatment per harvest interval . 
2.3. RNA isolation
Cultured cells from each blood pool were harvested from each well and centrifuged for 2 min at 800g , and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RNAiso Plus ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) . 
The mixture was extracted with chloroform , then precipitated with isopropanol according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
To avoid contamination with genomic DNA , total RNA samples were treated with RNase-Free DNasel ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) and then reverse transcribed using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Brieﬂy , 1 lg of RNA was reacted with 4 ll of 5 PrimeScript Buffer ( for Real Time ) , 1 ll of PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix I , 1 ll of Oligo dT primer ( 50 lM ) , 1 ll of Random 6 mers ( 100 lM ) , and RNase-free water ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) to a ﬁnal volume of 20 ll . 
These were incubated at 37 C for 15 min and heated at 85 C for 15 s to inactivate the enzyme . 
2.4 . 
Quantitative analysis of TLR and cytokine mRNA using real-time PCR 
The mRNA expression levels of TLR4 , TLR5 , TLR15 , IL-1b , IL-6 , TGF-b4 , CXCLi2 , and CCLi2 were determined by quantitative realtime PCR ( qRT-PCR ) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq ™ II ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) . 
The PCR mixture consisted of 2 ll of cDNA , 10 ll of 2 SYBR Premix Ex Taq ™ II , 0.8 ll of each of forward and reverse primers ( 10 lM ) , 0.4 ll of ROX Reference Dye II ( 50 ) , and RNase-free water to a ﬁnal volume of 20 ll . 
The primer sequences and their respective GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 1 and standard curves were produced for each primer set . 
Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on an ABI PRISM 7500 Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) with the following program : 1 cycle at 95 C for 30 s , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 5 s and 60 C for 34 s. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate , and a nontemplate control was included on every plate to ensure that there was no contamination of the master mix . 
Ampliﬁed products were run on a gel and extracted using a PCR and Gel Puriﬁcation Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , US ) . 
For the purpose of assay validation , puriﬁed products were cloned into pMD18-T with a TA Cloning Kit ( TaKaRa , Biotechnology Co. Ltd. , Dalian , China ) and sequenced to verify proper target ampliﬁcation using M13 forward and reverse primers . 
2.5. Statistical analysis
The resulting threshold cycle ( Ct - the PCR cycle at which ampli-ﬁcation becomes signiﬁcant enough to cross the predetermined threshold ) values were normalized to the endogenous control ( b-actin ) , and the fold changes in expression of the target genes were determined using the DDCt method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . 
Fold change values generated by different lines were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using the SPSS 16.0 software . 
The Student 's t-test was used to determine signiﬁcant differences between fold change values of the two time points post infection . 
P values less than 0.05 were considered to be signiﬁcant . 
3. Results
3.1. Differential expression of toll-like receptors in PBMCs from different lines
We selected TLR4 , TLR5 , and TLR15 for comparative quantiﬁcation . 
Stimulation with SE caused signiﬁcant differences ( P < 0.05 ) in TLR4 expression at 2 h p.i. between Qingjiaoma and Sanhuang lines . 
The TLR4 expression was signiﬁcantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) at 4 h p.i. in Wugu and Xueshanma lines than in the Qingjiaoma and Sanhuang lines ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Infection with SE decreased TLR5 mRNA expression at 2 h p.i. in all the four lines , with expression levels signiﬁcantly lower ( P < 0.05 ) in Sanhuang chicken cells than in others , and signiﬁcantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) at 4 h p.i. in Wugu and Xueshanma lines ( Fig. 1B ) . 
Infection with SE showed the highest level of TLR15 mRNA expression at 2 h p.i. in Xueshanma chicken cells , and at 4 h p.i. in Wugu chicken cells ( Fig. 1C ) . 
3.2 . 
Differential expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines , antiinﬂammatory cytokines , and chemokines in PBMCs from different lines 
Breed effect was signiﬁcant ( P < 0.05 ) for IL-1b and IL-6 mRNA expression . 
Fold-change differences in expression due to infection with SE were the greatest in IL-1b and IL-6 at both harvest intervals . 
For IL-1b and IL-6 genes , Wugu line showed the highest expression by 363 - and 1469-fold at 2 h p.i. , and 675 - and 3274-fold at 4 h p.i. , respectively ; and the Xueshanma line showe the second-highest level of expression by 153 - and 834-fold and 315 - and 673-fold , respectively ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Expression of anti-inﬂammatory cytokine TGF-b4 did not differ signiﬁcantly ( P > 0.05 ) among the four lines at 2 h p.i. , however , the Qingjiaoma line showed signiﬁcantly higher expression level than the Xueshanma line at 4 h p.i. ( P < 0.05 ) ( Fig. 2C ) . 
The expression of CXCLi2 and CCLi2 was signiﬁcantly higher in the Wugu and Xueshanma lines than in the Qingjiaoma and Sanhuang lines at both 2 h p.i. ( P < 0.05 ) and 4 h p.i. ( P < 0.05 ) ( Fig. 2D and E ) . 
4. Discussion
We investigated mRNA expression of TLR and cytokine genes in PBMCs isolated from four diverse Chinese lines ( Qingjiaoma , Sanhuang , Wugu , and Xueshanma ) , exposed in vitro to SE . 
In the current study , Wugu and Xueshanma lines express higher levels of the three TLRs viz. , TLR4 , TLR5 and TLR15 than Qingjiaoma and Sanhuang lines . 
TLR4 is the principal receptor for LPS , a major membrane component of gram-negative bacteria ( Poltorak et al. .

The level of gene expression in SE-infected PBMCs isolated from Qingjiaoma , Sanhuang , Wugu and Xueshanma chickens . 
PBMCs were treated in vitro for 2 h or 4 h with live SE . 
The expression level of gene TLR4 ( A ) , TLR5 ( B ) , and TLR15 ( C ) was measured by qRT-PCR . 
Fold change values are means ± SD . 
Columns without shared letters for their speciﬁc test were signiﬁcantly different ( P < 0.05 ) .

1998 ) . 
Variable expression of TLR4 molecules has been reported previously in different chicken lines ( Dil and Qureshi , 2002 ) . 
In contrast to the present study , Nerren et al. ( 2009 ) found no significant differences in TLR4 mRNA expression between chicken lines in SE-stimulated heterophils . 
TLR5 , which recognizes ﬂagellin , was expressed to a lower extent in all four lines at 2 h p.i. but upregulated in Wugu and Xueshanma lines at 4 h p.i. . 
In a previous study , SE-inoculated Fayoumi and Leghorn lines had signiﬁcantly lower spleen TLR5 RNA expression than a broiler line ( Abasht et al. , 2009 ) . 
TLR5 mRNA expression in response to infection decreased in the spleen of Fayoumi , Leghorn , and broiler lines ( Abasht et al. , 2009 ) . 
A study by Higgs et al. ( 2006 ) revealed the presence of TLR15 , which is a novel avian-speciﬁc TLR in chickens , with no mammalian counterpart . 
Our study demonstrated that the levels of TLR15 mRNA expression were the greatest in Xueshanma and Wugu lines at 2 h and 4 h p.i. , respectively . 
Previous studies have shown that heterophils from chickens resistant to infection with SE had signiﬁcantly higher levels of TLR 15 mRNA expression prior to and following stimulation with SE , than the heterophils from chickens susceptible to infection with SE ( Nerren et al. , 2009 ) . 
Taken together , our results suggest that TLR15 recognizes some component of SE and plays a role in the avian immune response to SE ( MacKinnon et al. , 2009 ; Nerren et al. , 2010 ) . 
TLR activation on antigen presenting cells causes production of numerous cytokines and chemokines . 
Critical to this innate immune response is the signal transduction molecule NF-jB ( Li and Stark , 2002 ; Luster , 2002 ) . 
One signiﬁcant interaction between SE exposure and breed was observed in the expression of IL-1b , IL-6 , CXCLi2 , and CCLi2 mRNA . 
Wugu and Xueshanma lines exposed to SE produced signiﬁcantl more IL-1b , IL-6 , CXCLi2 , and CCLi2 mRNA than Qingjiaoma and Sanhuang lines . 
This ﬁnding was also similar to the studies of Swaggerty et al. ( 2004 ) and Redmond et al. ( 2009 ) . 
Swaggerty et al. ( 2004 ) found that heterophils from SE-resistant lines isolated at 1 day of age produced more IL-6 and CXCLi2 mRNA than heter-ophils from susceptible lines , when cultured with opsonized and non-opsonized SE . 
Heterophil stimulation with SE in vitro increased expression of IL-6 in the naive Fayoumi line , while commercially selected broiler and Leghorn line heterophils showed decreased or unchanged cytokine gene expression levels ( Redmond et al. , 2009 ) . 
The conventional paradigm for inﬂammatory response is for inverse expression of proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cyto-kines ( Strober et al. , 1997 ) . 
This was observed in several in vitro experiments that used heterophils isolated from commercial bird lines that differed with regard to resistance to Salmonella infection ( Swaggerty et al. , 2004 ) . 
In this study , in vitro exposure of PBMCs to SE resulted in no signiﬁcant differences in TGF-b4 expression among the different lines at 2 h p.i. but there is signiﬁcant difference between the Qingjiaoma and Xueshanma line at 4 h p.i. Although TGF-b4 mRNA levels may not necessarily equate to levels of bioactive TGF-b4 protein , measuring TGF-b4 mRNA levels is currently the only reliable method of quantifying this cytokine . 
Swaggerty et al. ( 2004 ) proposed a relationship between upregulation of TGF-b4 mRNA expression and increased susceptibility to SE . 
The current study shows the Wugu and Xueshanma lines to be more responsive to Salmonella than other chicken lines , as assessed by TLR and cytokine expression in vitro . 
Assessing the responses of genetically different lines may permit the enhancement of innate disease resistance by genetic selection .
