An immunochromatographic strip test using gold nanoparticles was developed for the rapid detection of Salmonella typhi ( S. typhi ) in human serum . 
The strip test based on the principle of sandwich immunoassay by the speciﬁc binding of antigens from S. typhi O901 and antibody of S. typhi O901 on a nitrocellulose membrane . 
Antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate was used as the label and was coated onto a glass ﬁber membrane , which was used as a conjugate pad . 
To create a test and control zone , antibody of S. typhi O901 and an anti-IgG were dotted on the nitrocellulose membrane , respectively . 
Positive samples were displayed as red dots at the test and control zones of the nitrocellulose membrane , while negative samples resulted in a red dot only in the control zone . 
The limit of detection ( LOD ) was found to be 5 1.14 × 10 cfu mL − 1 , which could be visually detected by the naked eye within 15 min . 
This strip test provided a lower detection limit 6 − 1 and analysis time than a dot blot immunoassay ( 8.88 × 10 cfu mL for LOD and 110 min for reaction time ) . 
In addition , our immunochromatographic strip test was employed to detect S. typhi in human serum effectively , with high accuracy . 
This strip test offers great promise for ost an a rapid , simple and low-c alysis of S. typhi .

1. Introduction
both undeveloped and developing countries . 
It is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi , a gram-negative , rod-shaped , motile bacterium . 
It is only known to infect humans , and has an estimated global incidence of 22 million cases and 200,000 deaths per year ( Fraser et al. , 2007 ; Abdoel et al. , 2007 ) . 
The transmission of S. typhi has several pathways , including through consumption of drinking water or food that is contaminated with these bacteria . 
The detection of S. typhi in urine or blood plays an important role in clinical research and diagnosis of typhoid fever . 
However , a person who recovers from typhoid fever may become Typhoid fever is a signiﬁcant global public health problem in lytical System Research Unit , Department of Chemistry , Faculty of Science , Chulalongkorn University , Patumwan , Bangkok 10330 , Thailand .

an asymptomatic carrier who can infect others . 
Thus , the level of S. typhi in the patient 's urine or blood after recovery should be continuously monitored to control the spread and avoid epidemics of this pathogen . 
From the risk of these bacteria , so the traditional methods for S. typhi detection are proposed such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Ngan et al. , 2010 ; Massi et al. , 2005 ) and pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis ( Thong et al. , 1996 ) . 
Although the above methods are effective for diagnosis , they are time-consuming analyses ( ∼ 7 days ) , need expensive instruments and require highly qualiﬁed skills . 
Immunoassays are one of the most popular alternatives for diagnosis , which are based on the speciﬁc binding of antibody to its antigen , with an increased sensitivity and selectivity and a reduction in analysis time ( Yeh et al. , 2009 ; Chu et al. , 2005 ) . 
A number of immunoassay methods , including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) ( Kumar et al. , 2008 ) , amperometric immunosensors ( Kameswara et al. , 2005 ) , metalloimmunoassays ( Dungchai et al. , 2008 ) and dot blot immunoassays ( Chaicumpa et al. , 1995 ) have been used for the detection and diagnosis of S. typhi . 
These methods provide effective and accurate detection . 
Unfortunately , mos of these methods require sophisticated and expensive instruments . 
Only the dot blot immunoassay is a low-cost , rapid and simple method ( Stott , 1989 ) . 
However , dot blot immunoassay requires many experimental steps including incubation and washing steps . 
With the afore mentioned drawbacks , the development of a new S. typhi detection method has been spurred at least in part by the desire to produce a low-cost and one-step point-of-care diagnostic testing . 
Point-of-care testing is needed in the developing world because it can reduce the number of clinic visits , decrease costs to the patient and healthcare system , increase patient compliance , and provide clinical services for people in low resource settings away from clinics . 
Immunochromatography combines the advantages of chromatography and immunoassays which the reaction between antibody and antigen occurs after chromatographic separation through a nitrocellulose membrane using capillary ﬂow . 
Therefore , this method can give a complete answer in one-step . 
The advantages of this method also include its user-friendly format , rapid operation , immediate results , long-term stability , ease of use by non-skilled personnel and relatively low cost ( Liu et al. , 2007 ; Zhou et al. , 2009 ) . 
labels such as alkaline phosphatase ( Boever et al. , 1995 ; Masson et al. , 1999 ; Vetcha et al. , 2002 ) and horseradish peroxidase ( Nishida et al. , 1985 ; Carlo and Mascini , 1996 ; Sun et al. , 2001 ) and metal labels such as gold nanoparticles ( Lyubavina et al. , 2005 ; Shim et al. , 2006 ; Zhang et al. , 2006 ; Huang , 2006 ) . 
The use of an enzyme label requires an additional step to allow the enzyme to react with an unstable substrate . 
In this work , gold nanoparticles are chosen as the label for a one-step immunochromatographic strip test . 
Gold nanoparticles have been widely used in different immunoassay techniques over the past several years , due to their long-term stability , easily controllable size distribution , and good compatibility with biological molecules , such as antibodies , antigen , proteins , DNA , and RNA ( Hou et al. , 2007 ) . 
The application of gold nanoparticles has been developed for the detection of several types of analytes , including heavy metal cations , small molecules and DNA , and in other diverse applications including protein analysis , cellular analysis , drug delivery and analytical labels ( Ma et al. , 2010 ; Ghosh et al. , 2008 ; Yu and Andriola , 2010 ) . 
rapid detection of S. typhi using the principle of a sandwich immunoassay . 
Antibody to S. typhi O901 bound with gold nanoparticles was used as the label . 
The details of the optimization and performance of our experiment are discussed in the following sections . 
The most popular labels used in immunoassays include enzyme In this work , immunochromatography was developed for the

2.1. Reagents and materials
from Whatman ( Maidstone , UK ) . 
Nitrocellulose membranes and cellulose absorbent pads were purchased from Millipore ( Billerica , USA ) . 
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies for polysaccharides of S. typhi O901 were obtained from Siriraj Hospital . 
S. typhi O901 antigens were obtained from Thammasat University ( Faculty of Allied Health Sciences ) . 
Goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc. ( West Grove , United States ) . 
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate ( III ) ( HAuCl4 ) and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) . 
Disodium hydrogen phosphate , potassium chloride , potassium dihydrogen phosphate , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate , and sodium citrate were purchased from Merck ( Darmstadt , Germany ) . 
The buffer used in immunochromatographic strip tests consisted of 137 mM sodium chloride , 2.7 mM KCl , 2 mM KH2PO4 , and 10 mM Glass ﬁber membranes and polyethylene sheets were purchased 
Na2HPO4 ( pH 7.4 ) . 
All of the solutions were prepared using Milli-Q 18 M water ( Millipore puriﬁcation system ) . 
2.2. Preparation of antibody–gold nanoparticle conjugate
The gold nanoparticles were prepared by mixing 1 mL of 1 % ( w/v ) HAuCl4 solution and 100 mL of ultrapure water and boiling while stirring . 
Then 2.5 mL of 1 % ( w/v ) sodium citrate was added to the solution under continuous heating and stirring for 15 min until the color of the solution changed to red . 
The gold nanoparticles solution was left to cool at room temperature under stirring and was later stored in dark ◦ bottles at 4 C . 
The solution of gold nanoparticles was characterized by a UV -- visible ( UV -- vis ) spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
Antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate was prepared according to the method previously reported ( Dungchai et al. , 2008 ) , the amount of antibody for polysaccharides of S. typhi O901 was optimized within the concentration range of 0 -- 1 mg mL − 1 . 
The solutions were prepared from 15 mg mL − 1 stock solution of antibody . 
An appropriate volume of the stock solution was added to 2 mL of the gold nanoparticles solution , and followed by incubation under continuous stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Then , 100 mL of blocking solution ( BSA ) was added to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding and incubated under continuous stirring at room temperature for 1 h . 
The antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min , and the soft sediment was washed , suspended in blocking solution and stored at ◦ 4 C . 
The solution of conjugate was characterized by UV -- vis spectrophotometer . 
2.3. Procedure for dot blot immunoassay
The schematic of the dot blot immunoassay is shown in Fig. 1A . 
The dot blot immunoassay was performed on a nitrocellulose membrane . 
Firstly , 1 L of the different concentrations of S. typhi was applied in dots on the nitrocellulose membrane , and the membrane was then dried for 30 min at room temperature . 
The membrane was immersed in blocking solution for 1 h with continuous shake . 
After that , the membrane was soaked in the antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate solution for 20 min and then washed in Milli Q water . 
The speciﬁc binding reaction between the antigen and the antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate caused the appearance of a red dot on the nitrocellulose membrane . 
The total analysis time is 110 min pads ( sample , conjugate , and absorbent pads ) and one nitrocellulose membrane ( Fig. 1B ) . 
The antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate was applied to the glass ﬁber membrane to be used as the conjugate pad , and this conjugate pad ◦ antibody for polysaccharides of S. typhi O901 and the goat anti-rabbit IgG were dotted on the nitrocellulose membrane to create test and control dots , respectively and the nitrocellulose membrane was then dried at room temperature for 1 h . 
The untreated glass ﬁber membrane and the untreated cellulose absorbent pad were used as the sample and absorbent pad , respectively . 
All of the pads and the membrane were attached to a polyethylene sheet . 
The running buffer was then applied to the sample pad and allowed to migrate up the membrane . 
A negative result was indicated by a colorless dot at the test zone , whereas a positive result presented as a red dot on the nitrocellulose membrane . 
Both negative and positive results performed red in control dot because goat anti-rabbit IgG is non-speciﬁc antibody that can bind with all types of rabbit antibody . 
The sandwich immunochromatographic strip consisted of three was then dried at 4 C for 1 h. The

tion , where HAuCl4 was reduced to neutral gold atoms by sodium citrate . 
The solution became supersaturated , and the gold gradually started to precipitate in the form of gold nanoparticles . 
The color of the solution changed from yellow of HAuCl4 to red of gold nanoparticles . 
The maximum absorbance of HAuCl4 and the gold nanoparticles occurred at wavelengths of 285 nm and 520 nm , respectively ( Fig. 2A ) . 
From the TEM images , the average particles size of gold nanoparticles was found to be 15 nm ( Fig. 2B ) . 
gold nanoparticles . 
The UV -- vis spectra of antibody -- gold nanoparticles exhibited maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 520 nm , and there was no signiﬁcant variation in the absorption spectrum between antibody -- gold nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Therefore , it could be explained that gold remained nanosized after binding with antibody ( Dungchai et al. , 2008 ) . 
of gold nanoparticles was studied in the concentration of the antibody from − 1 with respect to the antibody concentrations used . 
As the concentration of antibody increased , the absorbance also increased up to a maximum at 0.5 mg − 1 decreased ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , the minimal concentration of antibody necessary to stabilized gold nanoparticles was approximately at 0.5 mg − 1 Gold nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical condensa-For conjugation , the antibody was adsorbed on the surface of The effect of various amounts of antibody bound to the surface 0 to 1 mg mL by evaluating the absorbance at 520 nm mL of antibody and then the absorbance mL .

3.2. Optimization of the immunochromatography conditions
the sensitivity of our proposed method . 
To achieve high performance of the immunochromatographic strip test , the experimental parameters concerning the immunoreactions time were optimized . 
The nitrocellulose membranes of 2.5 , 3.0 and 3.5 cm in length , which the reactions completed within 5 , 10 and 15 min , respectively , were evaluated . 
A nitrocellulose membrane length of 3.5 cm was chosen as the optimal length ( see supporting information ) . 
Especially , the ﬂow rate of the running buffer along the nitrocellulose membrane can be controlled by many factors such as The immunoreaction time is an important parameter that affects surfactant ratio and concentration of the blocking buffer . 
In this work , BSA was added to the running buffer to block non-speciﬁc absorption and control the ﬂow rate of buffer . 
Hence , the effect of using running buffer containing PBS alone , 1 % BSA , 3 % BSA , or 10 % ( w/v ) BSA was studied ( data not shown ) . 
The highest BSA concentration tested was close to the maximum solubility of BSA in PBS . 
The effect of the various running buffers was studied using a concentration of 1.14 × 108 cfu mL − 1 of S. typhi . 
The ﬂow rate of the running buffer decreased with increasing of levels of BSA in PBS due to the increased viscosity of the buffer . 
With a S. typhi load 8 − 1 of 1.14 × 10 cfu mL , PBS buffer and 1 % ( w/v ) BSA appeared colorless in both the test and control dot due to high ﬂow rate of the running buffer . 
3 % BSA and 10 % ( w/v ) BSA slowed down the ﬂow rate of buffer , so two red dots appeared on membrane . 
The color intensity of 10 % ( w/v ) BSA was higher color intensity than 3 % BSA because there was a longer reaction time between S. typhi and antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate . 
Therefore , 10 % ( w/v ) BSA was chosen as optimal concentration of BSA in the running buffer . 
Moreover , the effect of the volume of antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate was studied . 
The results revealed that the color intensity detected with 9 L of the conjugate solution provided the best result because this volume of solution was enough to completely react with S. typhi ( see supporting information ) . 
3.3. The detection of S. typhi using immunochromatographic strip test
Under the optimal conditions , the size of the test strip was 0.5 cm in width and 8.3 cm in length with a sample volume of 140 L

( A ) UV -- vis spectra of ( a ) HAuCl4 , ( b ) gold nanoparticles and ( c ) polyclonal rabbit antibody -- gold nanoparticles conjugate . 
( B ) TEM images of gold nanoparticle sizes produced by sodium citrate reduction of HAuCl4 solutions . 
The results of our sandwich immuno-chromatographic strip test showed that only one red control dot appeared for a negative test ( running buffer without S. typhi ) , while the positive test ( running buffer with S. typhi ) formed a red in both the test and control dots on the nitrocellulose membrane ( Fig. 3A ) . 
between 1.14 3 − 1 10 results were shown in Fig. 3B . 
Two red dots appeared at concentrations as low as 1.14 × 105 cfu mL − 1 of S. typhi . 
At concentrations lower than 1.14 × 105 cfu mL − 1 , only the control dot appeared red on the nitrocellulose membrane . 
Therefore , LOD of this method was found to be 1.14 × 105 cfu mL − 1 of S. typhi , which was evaluated by the naked eye within 15 min . 
Comparison with previous works , antibody array using nitrocellulose membrane was used to detect foodborne pathogens , including Salmonella spp . 
and Escherichia coli ( Karoonuthaisiri et al. , 2009 ) . 
The limit of detection of Salmonella spp . 
in this previous work was 106 -- 107 cfu mL − 1 and the array time was 1 h. Moreover , multiple bacterial pathogens , including Listeria , Staphylococcus , Salmonella , Vibrio , and Escherichia , were detected using light-scattering sensor with label-free by Banada et al. ( 2009 ) . 
The detection time of Salmonella was 18 -- 20 h. Therefore , our method provided the lower limit of detection and less analysis time than this previous works . 
our proposed method for the detection of S. typhi was compared to a dot blot immunoassay . 
The detection of S. typhi by dot blot assay using antibody -- gold nanoparticle conjugate as the label was studied at 6 − 1 1.14 × 9 − 1 dot was apparent at 8.88 × 106 cfu mL − 1 of S. typhi . 
Therefore , the LOD was found to be 8.88 × 106 cfu mL − 1 of S. typhi , which could be visually evaluated by the naked eye within 110 min . 
These results demonstrate that the advantage of the detection of S. typhi using a The ability to detect S. typhi was evaluated at concentrations × 10 cfu mL and 1.14 × 8 cfu mL − 1 which the Furthermore , the analytical performance and analysis time of the concentration of S. typhi between 4.44 × 10 cfu mL and 10 cfu mL with 2-fold serial dilutions ( Fig. 3C ) . 
A weak red strip test over a dot blot immunoassay is rapid , simple , and has a lower LOD . 
Moreover , we studied the lifetime of devices to be useful in the ﬁeld . 
The result showed that the strip test can be kept until 30 days at room temperature for the detection of S. typhi effectively . 
For the speciﬁcity of the strip test , the other species of Salmonella spp . 
was tested with the concentration of 107 cfu mL − 1 , including S. chicago , S. cholerasuis , S. dublin , S. enteridis , S. paratyphi A , S. paratyphi B , S. paratyphi C , S. typhimurium and S. virchow . 
All of 9 species of Salmonella spp . 
displayed negative results which only one red control dot appeared ( see supporting information Fig . 
S3 ) . 
This could explain that the test strip was speciﬁc to S. typhi . 
3.4. The application of the immunochromatographic strip test for the detection of S. typhi in human serum
To evaluate our method , the immunochromatographic strip test was utilized to detect S. typhi in human serum . 
Different concentrations of S. typhi between 1.14 × 105 cfu − 1 mL and 1.14 × 108 cfu mL − 1 were spiked to normal human serum . 
The results showed that two red dots appeared on all nitrocellulose membranes ( data not shown ) . 
The sensitivity of the strip test was evident from the detection of 20 positive human serums ( spiked normal human serum ) and 20 negative human serums ( normal human serum ) ( see supporting information Table S1 ) . 
Among 20 positive human serums samples , 20 samples ( 100 % ) were positively detected , while 20 of 20 negative human serums were conﬁrmed to be negative by the strip test . 
Therefore , the strip test was effective for the detection of S. typhi in serum samples . 
4. Conclusion
An alternative approach for rapid detection of S. typhi with an immunochromatographic strip test was successfully develope in human serum . 
This work ( LOD : 1.14 × 5 − 1 provided a lower LOD and shorter analysis time than a dot blot immunoassay ( LOD : 8.88 × 106 cfu mL − 1 , 110 min ) . 
This proposed method was also successfully applied to the detection of S. typhi in spiked normal human serum within 15 min using only one step and had accuracy and speciﬁcity of 100 % . 
This strip test can be kept until 30 days at room temperature to detect S. typhi effectively . 
Therefore , the immunochromatographic strip test offers an attractive method for the detection of S. typhi in clinical and point-of-care diagnosis .
