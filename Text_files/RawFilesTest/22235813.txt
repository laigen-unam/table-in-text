Introduction
Salmonella is one of the most common and widely distributed bacterial pathogens and the causative agent of salmonellosis . 
It is a major public health problem , and millions of human cases are reported worldwide every year . 
In 2007 , 151,995 human cases of Salmonella infections were reported in the European Union ( EFSA 2009 ) . 
In the Netherlands , one of the predominant serovar causing human salmonellosis is Salmonella enterica subsp . 
enterica serovar Typhimur-ium , associated with approximately 30 % of the cases ( Doorduyn et al. 2006 ) . 
In general , Salmonella infections in humans are foodborne . 
In particular food products of animal origin , such as eggs , poultry and meat , are important sources of infection . 
Salmonella is able to attach to various surfaces where it can form bioﬁlms ( Sinde and Carballo 2000 ; Prouty et al. 2002 ; Stepanovic et al. 2004 ; Ledeboer and Jones 2005 ) . 
A bioﬁlm is an accumulation of bacterial cells immobilized on a surface and embedded in an extracellular matrix ( Costerton 1999 ) . 
Bacteria within a bioﬁlm have a distinct phenotype from planktonic cells and generally show higher resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics ( Kumar and Anand 1998 ; Scher et al. 2005 ) . 
Proposed mechanisms for the increased resistance of bioﬁlms against disinfectants and antibiotics are activation of bioﬁlm speciﬁc defense mechanisms , and changes in the physiology of the bacteria induced by attachment and limited availability of key nutrients . 
Furthermore , the extracellular matrix contributes to the increased resistance of bioﬁlm cells against disinfection treatments ( Solano et al. 2002 ; White et al. 2006 ; Vestby et al. 2009b ) . 
The extracellular matrix limits the diffusion of chemicals to the inside of the bioﬁlm and the outer layer of the bioﬁlm might quench disinfectants or antibiotics ( Gilbert et al. 2002 ) . 
The ability of Salmonella to form bioﬁlms on food processing equipment poses a major problem for the food industry ( Swanenburg et al. 2001 ; Vestby et al. 2009b ) . 
Also in medical settings problems occur due to Salmonella bioﬁlm formation ( Prouty et al. 2002 ) . 
Although the environmental conditions differ between industrial and medical settings , so far , no differences in bioﬁlm forming capacity between S. Typhimurium strains isolated in industrial or in medical settings were found ( Stepanovic et al. 2004 ; Solomon et al. 2005 ; Vestby et al. 2009a ) . 
Several studies have shown that curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose are major components of the extracellular matrix of S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms ( Römling et al. .

1998 ; Jonas et al. 2007 ) . 
These components are widely expressed among species of the Enterobacteriaceae ( Zogaj et al. 2003 ; Bokranz et al. 2005 ; Solomon et al. 2005 ) . 
Curli ﬁmbriae are proteinaceous extracellular ﬁbers that promote surface colonization and cell -- cell interactions ( Barnhart and Chapman 2006 ) . 
Production of curli ﬁmbriae is dependent on the proteins transcribed by the csgBAC and csgDEFG operons . 
CsgBA encodes for the structural proteins , while csgEFG encodes for accessory proteins required for curli assembly ( Barnhart and Chapman 2006 ) . 
These operons are positively regulated by the autoregulator CsgD . 
CsgD is also indirectly involved in cellulose production by activating transcription of adrA . 
AdrA expression is required for the synthesis of cellulose , even though the bcs genes , encoding for proteins essential for biosynthesis of cellulose , are constitutively expressed ( Zogaj et al. 2001 ) . 
The AdrA protein contains a GGDEF domain which has diguanylase cyclase activity . 
Therefore , AdrA can mediate the production of cyclic-di-GMP , an effector molecule involved in the activation of cellulose production ( Zogaj et al. 2001 ; Römling 2005 ) . 
The promoter region of the csgD promoter is a large intergenic region to which several regulatory proteins can bind directly . 
Different environmental conditions activate a different set of regulatory proteins . 
By binding to the intergenic region of the csgD promoter , they affect the expression of csgD ( Römling et al. 1998 ; Gerstel and Römling 2001 ) . 
Thus , environmental conditions can inﬂuence the production of the extracellular matrix components curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose , and the question arises whether differences in bioﬁlm forming behavior could be linked to differences in the activation of these components , and whether this can be linked to the origin of the strain . 
Therefore , the bioﬁlm forming capacity of 51 S. Typhimurium strains from different origins at ambient ( 258C ) and body ( 378C ) temperature in nutrient-rich Tryptone Soya Broth ( TSB ) and nutrient-low ( 1/20TSB ) conditions was analysed . 
These media were chosen since TSB is frequently used in bioﬁlm research and 1/20TSB is used in several other studies to mimic food industry conditions ( Stepanovic et al. 2004 ; Solomon et al. 2005 ; Kroupitski et al. 2009 ) . 
The bioﬁlm forming capacity was investigated with both the crystal violet ( CV ) assay and enumeration of bioﬁlm cells by plate counts . 
Furthermore , bioﬁlms grown under different conditions were examined by LIVE/DEAD staining , and SEM analysis and they were stained with calcoﬂuor to determine the cellulose content . 
In addition , the expression of key regulators of the extracellular matrix components curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose was analysed by the Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( Q-PCR ) . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
A total of 51 Salmonella enterica ssp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium strains of different origin was used in this study to investigate diversity in bioﬁlm forming capacity . 
The strain collection contained strains isolated in industrial environments , clinical isolates , outbreak-associated isolates , and strains isolated from retail products . 
The industrial isolates were all recently obtained in multiple meat processing plants and were isolated from equipment surfaces , food products , raw materials and the processing environment . 
Also the completely sequenced S. Typhimurium strain LT-2 was included . 
Due to a mutation in the rpoS gene , the LT-2 strain has an attenuated RpoS function . 
It has previously been shown that RpoS is a positive regulator of bioﬁlm formation ( Römling et al. 1998 ; Adams and McLean 1999 ; Robbe-Saule et al. 2006 ) . 
Therefore the rpoS deletion mutant of the LT-2 strain from the Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre , was also included ( Table 1 ) . 
Stocks were stored at 7808C in Brain Hearth Infusion broth ( BHI , Becton Dickson ) supplemented with 15 % glycerol ( Sigma ) . 
Single colonies were used to inoculate Luria Bertani broth ( LB , Merck ) and cultures were incubated for 18 h at 378C with agitation ( 200 rpm ) , after which the bacteria were used in the different experiments . 
Bioﬁlm formation
Bioﬁlm formation was analysed in TSB ( Oxoid ) and 20 times diluted TSB ( 1/20TSB ) in ﬂat bottom 96 well polystyrene microtiter plates ( Greiner Bio-one ) , using the crystal violet ( CV ) assay ( Djordjevic et al. 2002 ; Wijman et al. 2007 ) and plate counting . 
Wells were ﬁlled with 200 ml of medium , inoculated with 1.5 % ( vol/vol ) overnight grown cultures , and incubated statically for 24 h at 258C or 378C . 
In the CV assay , the wells were washed twice with 250 ml of water . 
Subsequently , the bioﬁlms were stained for 30 min with 225 ml of 0.1 % ( wt/vol ) CV ( Merck ) and washed three times with 250 ml of water . 
The attached CV was solubilized with 250 ml 96 % ethanol and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm ( SpectraMax , Molecular Devices ) . 
For enumeration by plate counting , the wells were washed four times with 250 ml of peptone physiological salt solution ( pps ) to remove unbound cells . 
Subsequently the wells were swabbed to detach the bioﬁlm cells . 
The swab and the cell suspension were vortexed with glass beads ( 106 mm , Sigma ) in order to remove bioﬁlm cells from the swab and to obtain single cells . 
An appropriate dilution was made in pps and the cells were enumerated by plating on TSA . 
The plates were incubated overnight at 378C and the colonies wer counted . 
Both bioﬁlm formation assays were performed in three biologically independent experiments .

Modeling the relationship between microtiter plate bioﬁlm assay and plate counts
To investigate the relation between the CV assay and the amount of attached bioﬁlm cells , the following model was used to ﬁt the data for each culture condition : where A595 is the absorbance of the solubilized CV after bioﬁlm formation , N is the number of viable attached bioﬁlm cells ( CFU well ) , b the backgroun 71 signal ( three times the standard deviation ( SD ) above the mean A595 of the negative control ) and a is the proportionality constant between CV staining and cell counts . 
The parameters a and b were estimated by ﬁtting Equation 1 to the data points in TableCurve 2D ( Windows v. 2.03 ) . 
The ﬁtted parameters were veriﬁed in Microsoft Excel by using Excel Solver add-in .

Morphotype identiﬁcation on Congo red and Calcoﬂuor agar plates
The ability to produce curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose was analyzed on LB without NaCl agar plates supplemen-ted with 40 mg ml71 of Congo red ( Sigma ) and 20 mg ml of Coomassie brilliant blue ( Merck ) . 
Cellulose 71 production was further characterized on agar plates containing 40 mg ml71 of Calcoﬂuor ( Fluorescent Brightner 28 , Sigma ) ( Römling et al. 2003 ) . 
After incubation for 48 h at 258C or 378C , the colony morphology was examined . 
Evaluation of bioﬁlms with ﬂuorescent microscopy
For this analysis , bioﬁlms were grown on polystyrene coupons ( 18 mm 6 22 mm ) placed in a 12 well plate . 
The wells were half ﬁlled with 3 ml of TSB or 1/20TSB and inoculated with 1.5 % ( vol/vol ) overnight grown cultures . 
To analyse the cellulose content of a bioﬁlm , the media were supplemented with 40 mg ml71 of calcoﬂuor . 
After 24 h incubation at 258C or 378C the coupons were washed four times with peptone buffered saline ( PBS ) and examined with an Olympus BX41 microscope . 
To visualize the calcoﬂuor stain a U-MWU-2 ﬂuorescence ﬁlter ( Olympus ) was used . 
To determine cell viability the coupons were stained with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability staining kit according to manufacturer 's protocol . 
Fluorescence of the LIVE/DEAD probes was observed using U-MNBV ( SYTO9 ) and U-MWIG ( PI ) ﬂuorescence ﬁlters . 
A Dialux 20 microscope ( Leica ) was used to take images at a magniﬁcation of 10006 . 
In total , about 25 images were examined for each sample . 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Bioﬁlms were grown as described above . 
After the incubation coupons were washed four times with PBS , the samples were ﬁxed with 3 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.2 for 1 h at room temperature . 
Subsequently , they were rinsed three times over 45 min with buffer and treated with 1 % OsO4 for 1 h at room temperature . 
Next , the samples were washed with water and dehydrated in an acetone series ( 10 % , 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 90 % , 100 % , each step 15 min ) . 
Then , they were critical point dried ( CPD ) with carbon dioxide ( CPD 030 , 
BalTec , Liechtenstein ) . 
For SEM imaging the samples were attached to a sample holder by carbon adhesive tabs ( EMS Washington USA ) and sputter coated with 5 nm tungsten ( MED 020 , Leica , Vienna , Austria ) . 
Samples were analysed at 2 kV at room temperature in a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope ( Magellan 400 , FEI , Eindhoven , the Netherlands ) . 
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated from planktonic cells , grown statically in tubes containing 10 ml of medium , and from bioﬁlm cells , grown as described above . 
Both planktonic and bioﬁlm cells were cultured in TSB or 1 / 20TSB at 258C or 378C for 24 h. Planktonic cells and bioﬁlms were quenched in RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent ( QIAGEN ) and harvested by centrifugation ( planktonic cells ) or scraping ( bioﬁlm cells ) . 
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) with an on-column DNase treatment according to manufacturer 's protocol . 
For each sample , 300 ng total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturer 's protocol . 
RNA samples were checked for genomic DNA contamination by omitting the Superscript III reverse transcriptase . 
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real time PCR ( Q-PCR ) was performed using the 2x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied 1 Biosystems ) in a ﬁnal volume of 25 ml . 
Forward and reverse primers ( Table 2 ) were designed with an amplicon length of * 100 bp using PRIMER 3 ( free software , http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ ) . 
Primers were added at a concentration of 250 nM . 
Reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System with an initial step of 10 min at 958C , and 40 cycli of 15 s at 958C and 1 min at 598C . 
To check for speciﬁcity of the ampliﬁcation , a melting curve was added . 
Furthermore a standard curve was derived for each primer set to determine the eficiency . 
The relative expression levels of the genes of interest between conditions and strains were compared using the housekeeping gene 16S rRNA for normalization . 
Q-PCR was performed on three biological independent experiments using two replicates each . 
Signiﬁcant differences in expression levels were identiﬁed by using a two-tailed student 's t-test in Excel ( p 5 0.05 , t-test ) . 
Results
Diversity in bioﬁlm forming capacity
The bioﬁlm forming capacity of 51 S. Typhimurium strains was determined under various cultur conditions using the CV assay . 
The bioﬁlm forming capacity was dependent on medium and temperature , but also on the origin of the strain ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . 
All S. Typhimurium strains exhibiting bioﬁlm formation in the CV assay , showed most CV binding to the wells at the liquid-air interface ( data not shown ) . 
Notably , the formation of pellicles was not observed under the tested conditions . 
At 258C , the bioﬁlm forming behaviour of the complete collection of S. Typhimurium strains could be divided into three different groups , group A , B and C ( Figure 1A ) . 
Group A strains produced dense bioﬁlms in both media at 258C , and in TSB also at 378C . 
A dense bioﬁlm was deﬁned at an A595 0.24 , which is three times the background signal . 
The background signal was deﬁned as three times the SD above the mean A595 of the negative control . 
The group B strains only formed dense bioﬁlms in the 1 / 20TSB medium at 258C and the group C strains showed little to no bioﬁlm formation at all tested culture conditions . 
At 378C , the strains generally showed less bioﬁlm formation than at 258C ( Figure 1B ) . 
This was not related with differences in growth capabilities , since higher cell densities were reached after growth in the 96 well plates at 378C ( data not shown ) . 
These data indicate that bioﬁlm formation is inﬂuenced by environmental conditions such as med-ium composition , oxygen and temperature , and that bioﬁlm forming behaviour is associated with strain origin . 
In general , the clinical , outbreak-associated and retail product isolates were group A strains and most industrial isolates belonged to group B strains , with only two of the 16 clinical isolates , strain C15 and C16 , assigned to group B , and two of the 23 industrial isolates , strain I1 and I2 , assigned to group A . 
The group C strains comprise two industrial isolates , strain I22 and I23 , and the reference strain LT-2 ( L1 ) and its rpoS mutant ( L2 ) ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . 
Of the S. Typhimurium strains , three group A , two group B , and two group C strains were selected for further analyses . 
The selected strains are marked by a closed symbol in Figure 1 . 
One of the selected group C strains ( strain L2 ) is a rpoS mutant of the completely sequenced S. Typhimurium LT2 strain ( McClelland et al. 2001 ) . 
It has previously been shown that rpoS is a positive regulator of bioﬁlm formation ( Römling et al. 1998 ; Adams and McLean 1999 ; Robbe-Saule et al. 2006 ) . 
Sequence analysis veriﬁed the presence of an intact rpoS gene for all selected strains , except for strain L2 . 
Furthermore , no mutations in the upstream promoter regions were found ( data not shown ) .

Enumeration and viability of bioﬁlm cells
The CV assay is generally used to analyse bioﬁlm forming capacity of bacteria . 
However , not much is known about the contribution of the number of bioﬁlm cells , and the extracellular matrix to the tota amount of CV binding . 
Therefore , it is important to determine how the results of the CV assay correlate with the number of bioﬁlm cells . 
First the viability of cells within the bioﬁlm was determined using LIVE/DEAD staining . 
In TSB + 90-95 % ( Figure 2B ) and in 1/20TSB + 95 -- 100 % ( Figure 2C ) of the bioﬁlm cells grown at 258C were stained green , indicating that most cells were viable . 
Similar data on viability were obtained with cells from bioﬁlms grown at 378C ( data not shown ) . 
Thus , in all tested culture conditions no noteworthy contribution of dead cells to 24 h old bioﬁlms was observed . 
Next the amount of viable bioﬁlm cells were quantiﬁed by plate counts . 
The bioﬁlms were detached by swabbing after which cell suspensions were vortexed with glass beads to separate the bioﬁlm cells . 
Microscopic evaluation revealed that the method used to obtain single cells was suficient for bioﬁlms grown in TSB or 1/20TSB at 258C and 378C . 
In Figure 2A , the relation between the OD values obtained in the CV assay and the number of bioﬁlm cells for the different culture conditions is shown . 
In TSB , the group A strains yielded * 8.1 log CFU well71 at both 258C and 378C after 24 h , while the group B and C strains showed 57 log CFU well71 under these conditions . 
Interestingly , for the group A strains no signiﬁcant difference in CFU well was detected between 25 71 8C and 378C , even though the CV assay showed a signiﬁcant difference . 
In 1/20TSB , the number of bioﬁlm cells for the group A and B strains was comparable , which is in agreement with the results of the CV assay . 
However , in this medium there are slightly , but signiﬁcantly , more bioﬁlm cells for these strains at 378C ( 7.6 -- 7.8 log CFU well71 ) than at 258C ( 7.3 -- 7.5 log CFU well ) ( p 71 50.05 , t-test ) , even though CV binding was considerably higher at 258C than at 378C . 
To enable a comparison of the data obtained , the data set for each culture condition was ﬁtted with a linear model ( Equation 1 ) . 
This model contains a factor ( a ) that represents a proportional constant between the CV staining and cell counts ( Figure 2A ) . 
Factor a was higher for the ﬁtted model of the results 78 in 1/20TSB at 258C ( a 1/4 2.54 6 10 ) compared with 79 the other culture conditions ( a 1/4 7.22 6 10 for TSB at 258C , a 1/4 5.30 6 1079 for TSB at 378C , and a 1/4 4.11 6 1079 for 1/20TSB at 378C ) . 
These results suggest that in 1/20TSB at 258C , extracellular matrix production is increased compared with the other tested culture conditions . 
Therefore the inﬂuence of environmental conditions on the formation of the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix was further investigated .

Curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose production was analysed on agar plates containing congo red or calcoﬂuor . 
At 258C , both the group A and group B strains expressed the red , dry , and rough ( rdar ) morphotype ( Table 3 ) , which correlates with production of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose ( Römling et al. 2003 ; Jonas et al. 2007 ; Malcova et al. 2008 ) . 
The group C strains expressed the smooth and white ( saw ) morphotype at 258C , which relates to absence of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose production ( Römling et al. 1998 ) . 
At 378C , the group A and B strains also expressed the saw morphotype . 
From group C , strain I23 expressed the saw morphotype , while for strain L2 a smooth and red ( sar ) morphotype was observed , which indicates that congo red was capable of binding to this strain under this culture condition . 
Cellulose production was further characterized on agar plates supplemented with calcoﬂuor ( Table 3 ) . 
At 258C , the group A and B strains showed intense ﬂuorescence , whereas for the group C strains no ﬂuorescence was detected . 
At 378C , no ﬂuorescence was observed for the strains that expressed a sa 
Note : Morphotypes expressed on congo red agar plates : rdar ( red , dry and rough ) , saw ( smooth and white ) , and sar ( smooth and red ) . 
The morphotypes observed are comparable to those found in other studies ( Barnhart and Chapman 2006 ; Römling et al. 1998 ; Jones et al. 2007 ) .

morphotype on the congo red agar plates . 
For strain L2 , which expressed a sar morphotype , some ﬂuorescence was detected . 
This indicates that strain L2 produced cellulose at 378C , although the ﬂuorescence was less compared with the group A and B strains at 258C . 
The results of these plate assays indicate that the group A and B strains have the capacity to produce curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose at 258C . 
Expression of Curli ﬁmbriae
Curli ﬁmbriae are known to be an important component of the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix ( Römling et al. 1998 ; Jonas et al. 2007 ) . 
Therefore , the expression of curli ﬁmbriae was analyzed by Q-PCR in planktonic and bioﬁlm cells , in TSB and 1/20TSB , and at 258C and 378C ( Figure 3 ) . 
The expression of both the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator of the csg operons , csgD , and the gene encoding the major structural subunit of curli ﬁmbriae , csgA , was investigated . 
Both genes showed comparable expression patterns . 
In TSB , no relevant differences in csgD and csgA expression between the different culture conditions or strains were detected ( Figure 3A and C ) . 
However in 1 / 20TSB , signiﬁcant differences in expression were observed ( Figure 3B and D ) . 
In general , both genes were higher expressed in 1/20TSB at 258C . 
Expression of csgD and csgA was signiﬁcantly increased in bioﬁlm cells grown in 1/20TSB at 258C compared with 378C or TSB ( p50 .05 , t-test ) , except for strain L2 . 
In addition , the expression of both genes was considerable higher for group A and B strains than for group C strains at this culture condition ( p50 .05 , t-test ) . 
Furthermore in 1/20TSB at 258C , the expression of csgA in group A and B strains was induced more in bioﬁlm cells compared with planktonic cells ( p50 .05 , t-test ) . 
These results are consistent with the bioﬁlm forming capacity of these strains in 1/20TSB at 258C . 
This suggests that curli ﬁmbriae are important for bioﬁlm formation and that they form an important component of the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix under this culture condition . 
Presumably , they might not be as important for bioﬁlm formation at 378C and/or in a nutrient-rich environment .

Cellulose expression
Besides curli ﬁmbriae , cellulose may also contribute to the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix . 
Therefore the expression of bcsA , which encodes cellulose synthase , and adrA , which encodes a protein proposed to be required for cellulose synthesis ( Zogaj et al. 2001 ) , were analysed in planktonic and bioﬁlm cells grown in TSB and 1/20TSB at 258C and 378C . 
No signiﬁcant differences in bcsA expression between any of the tested culture conditions or between the different strains , was detected ( data not shown ) . 
Thus the expression of bcsA was not affected by environmental conditions . 
However , signiﬁcant differences in adrA expression were observed . 
The expression of this gene was higher in bioﬁlm cells grown in 1/20TSB compared with bioﬁlm cells grown in TSB ( p50 .05 , t-test ) , except for strain L2 ( Figure 4 ) . 
In addition , bioﬁlm cells of group A and B strains show increased expression of adrA in 1/20TSB at 258C compared with planktonic cells ( p50 .05 , t-test ) ( Figure 4B ) . 
These results are consistent with the bioﬁlm forming capacity of these strains and with the induced expression of curli ﬁmbriae in 1/20TSB at this temperature . 
In TSB , no relevant differences in adrA expression between the different culture conditions or the different strain groups were detected ( Figure 4A ) . 
The expression analysis of csgA , csgD and adrA , suggest that both curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose act as matrix components during bioﬁlm formation in 1 / 20TSB at 258C . 
Interestingly , group A strains also showed dense bioﬁlm formation in TSB at 258C and 378C ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , it is possible that other features contribute to bioﬁlm formation in a nutrient-rich medium . 
Microscopic evaluation of S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms
Bioﬁlms grown on coupons of the selected strains were microscopically examined to obtain more information on the morphology of S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms . 
In addition the bioﬁlms were stained with calcoﬂuor to analyse the cellulose content of the bioﬁlms , and to investigate if increased adrA expression is associate with induced cellulose production . 
Representative pictures of group A , B , and C strains grown under different culture conditions are shown in Figure 5 . 
In TSB , the group A strains showed a dense layer of bacteria at 258C and 378C , in which small spots of calcoﬂuor were visible ( Figure 5 ) . 
These results might suggest that cellulose was expressed only by some small clusters of cells . 
For group B and C strains , small cell clusters and single attached cells were observed ( Figure 5 ) . 
In bioﬁlms from the group B strains also a small subpopulation of cells exhibited some cellulose production in TSB . 
On the other hand , in 1/20TSB at 258C , large cell clusters with a high level of calcoﬂuor staining were observed for group A and B strains ( Figure 5 ) , which implies that large amounts of cellulose were present in the extracellular matrix of these bioﬁlms . 
The same strains showed smaller cell clusters stained with calcoﬂuor at 378C , but the ﬂuorescence intensity was substantially lower than at 258C . 
Less bioﬁlm cells were found for the group C strains , but also these bioﬁlms displayed some cellulose production around the microcolonies and single attached cells in 1/20TSB ( Figure 5 ) . 
The Q-PCR data and the calcoﬂuor stained bioﬁlms showed that curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose are speciﬁcally induced during bioﬁlm formation in 1 / 20TSB at 258C , which is also in agreement with the results of CV staining and cell counts , suggesting that increased extracellular matrix production occurs under this culture condition .

All images were taken at a magniﬁcation of 10006 . 
Scanning electron microscopy
With SEM more detailed images of bioﬁlms of group A strains grown in TSB or 1/20TSB at 258C were made ( Figure 6 ) . 
The SEM images conﬁrmed the conclusion that bioﬁlms grown in 1/20TSB produced more extracellular matrix than bioﬁlms grown in TSB . 
In TSB , a dense layer of cells with almost no extracellular matrix was observed . 
In 1/20TSB , clusters of cells were found of which a subpopulation of the cells was completely encapsulated . 
Although the cells are encapsulated , by vortexing with beads single cells could still be obtained . 
Presumably these cells were encapsulated with cellulose , since high levels of calcoﬂuor were found to bind to bioﬁlms grown in 1 / 20TSB at 258C . 
Discussion
In this study , by combining the CV assay with LIVE / DEAD staining and enumeration of the attached bioﬁlm cells , it was demonstrated that the number of attached bioﬁlm cells and the extracellular matrix wer inﬂuenced by environmental conditions , such as temperature and nutrient availability . 
Further analysis of the expression and production of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose , which are major components of the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix , showed that these components particularly contribute to the total amount of bioﬁlm formation in low nutrient conditions ( 1/20TSB ) at ambient temperatures and that these components might not be as important during bioﬁlm formation at 378C or in nutrient-rich conditions such as TSB ( Figure 7 ) . 
By screening the collection of 51 S. Typhimurium strains with the CV assay , it was found that the industrial isolates generally exhibited dense bioﬁlm formation in 1/20TSB at 258C only . 
However , the clinical , outbreak-associated and retail product isolates also showed dense bioﬁlm formation in TSB at 258C and 378C . 
These results are in contradiction with previous studies using a range of clinical , animal , outbreak-associated and retail product isolates , that showed no relation between bioﬁlm forming behavior and strain origin ( Stepanovic et al. 2004 ; Solomon et al. 2005 ) . 
However , in these studies the bioﬁlm forming capacity was tested at relatively high temperatures only , ie at 30 and 358C , and this may have affected the outcome of these studies , since the present results indicate that temperature greatly inﬂuences bioﬁlm formation . 
Furthermore , highest bioﬁlm formation was observed by the group A strains in the nutrient-rich TSB medium , while the group B strains only showed dense bioﬁlm formation in 1/20TSB . 
Thus bioﬁlm forming capacity was also inﬂuenced by the culture medium . 
Eficient bioﬁlm formation by the group B strains in 1 / 20TSB might be associated with limitation of a speciﬁc component or combinations thereof , but alternatively , bioﬁlm formation might be inhibited by one or more components that are present at higher levels in TSB . 
To test the latter hypothesis , a range of amino acids and carbon sources were separately added to 1/20TSB to concentrations comparable to that in TSB , and the effect on bioﬁlm formation was analysed . 
However , none of the tested components showed inhibition of bioﬁlm formation of the group B strains ( data not shown ) . 
Eficient bioﬁlm formation of group A strains in nutrient-rich conditions could be linked to speciﬁc features that are either absent or not induced in the group B and C strains in such conditions . 
The putative factor ( s ) involved remain to be elucidated . 
Analysis of bioﬁlm forming capacity with the widely used CV assay does not supply information on the relative contribution of bioﬁlm cells and the extracellular matrix . 
The present results of the combined CV and enumeration assays , revealed that the lowest boundary for the CV assay is * 6.8 log CFU well71 , which indicates that this assay is not very sensitive and may fail to detect low levels of bioﬁlm formation . 
Furthermore , the contribution of the extracellular matrix was shown to be variable between different environmental conditions . 
Notably , in none of the conditions were signiﬁcant amounts of dead cells were found to contribute to the bioﬁlm , indicating that in particular at 258C in 1/20TSB the extracellular matrix is an important component of the bioﬁlms formed . 
Subsequent , Q-PCR analysis indeed showed that the expression of selected genes with roles in the production of curli ﬁmbriae ( csgD and csgA ) and cellulose ( adrA ) was particularly induced in the bioﬁlm cells of group A and group B strains in 1/20TSB at 258C . 
This suggest that curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose are speciﬁcally involved in bioﬁlm formation in a low nutrient medium at ambient temperatures , and that other factors might be involved in bioﬁlm formation at body temperature and / or in a nutrient-rich environment ( Figure 7 ) . 
Furthermore , correlations in expression patterns between csgD and adrA were observed , ie increased csgD expression is associated with up-regulation of adrA . 
Recently , Zakikhany et al. ( 2010 ) presented evidence that CsgD interacts with DNA directly and activates transcription of adrA . 
In addition , in the present study , no signiﬁcant differences were detected in the expression of bcsA between the different culture conditions or strains , while microscope images of the bioﬁlms showed intense calcoﬂuor stained bioﬁlm cells for the group A and B strains in 1/20TSB at 258C , only . 
These results support the previously postulated hypothesis that AdrA positively affects cellulose production at a posttranscriptional level ( Zogaj et al. 2001 ; Römling 2005 ; Zakikhany et al. 2010 ) . 
However , to conﬁrm this interaction , more research is needed . 
Further microscopic analyses of the calcoﬂuor stained bioﬁlms and SEM analysis revealed heteroge-neity in cellulose production . 
For example , the SEM images show that a subpopulation of bioﬁlm cells in 1 / 20TSB is encapsulated by extracellular matrix , conceivably cellulose . 
Heterogeneity in cellulose production in bioﬁlms has not been described before for Salmonella , but the present observation is in line with observations made by Grantcharova et al. ( 2010 ) . 
They reported single-cell expression analysis which revealed that csgD is expressed in a bistable manner during bioﬁlm development . 
The subpopulation of cells expressing large amounts of csgD is engaged in cellulose production , indicating that bistability at the level of csgD expression leads to a corresponding pattern of task distribution in S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms ( Grantcharova et al. 2010 ) . 
Notably , in earlier studies on Salmonella bioﬁlm formation the analysis of cellulose production included detachment of cellulose from the cell wall , followed by hydrolysis and quantiﬁcation of the sugar monomers by GS-MS ( Bokranz et al. 2005 ) . 
However , in this way it is not possible to analyse the distribution of cellulose in bioﬁlms . 
Moreover , in the current study evidence is provided that environmental conditions affect both the extracellular matrix and bioﬁlm morphology . 
In the rich TSB medium , bioﬁlms of the group A strains showed a dense layer of bacterial cells , while in 1/20TSB group A and group B strains showed cell clusters embedded in cellulose . 
The results indicate that both group A strains , which are mainly clinical , out-break associated and retail product isolates , and group B strains , which are mainly industrial isolates , are able to express curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose . 
However , the expression of these components in both group A and group B strains , was particularly induced in 1/20TSB at 258C , which appeared to be related with the expression of csgD . 
Previously , it was shown that expression of csgD is regulated by a variety of environmental signals ( Gerstel and Römling 2003 ) . 
The present results suggest that CsgD is highly activated under lo nutrient conditions at ambient temperatures , which results in the production of curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose . 
Apparently , under nutrient-rich conditions bioﬁlm formation by the group A strains is dependent on other features that are either absent or not induced in the group B and group C strains under this environmental condition ( Figure 7 ) . 
This suggests that the majority of the clinical , outbreak-associated and retail product isolates ( group A strains ) used in this study have adapted to and/or been selected for their capacity produce dense bioﬁlms under nutrient-rich conditions at ambient and body temperature . 
Whether this has provided a selective advantage for the clinical isolates in colonization of the host remains to be elucidated . 
It is conceivable that bioﬁlms containing large amounts of extracellular matrix might be more dificult to eradicate during disinfection treatments due to the protective effect of the extracellular matrix ( Solano et al. 2002 ; White et al. 2008 ; Vestby et al. 2009a ) . 
On the other hand , bioﬁlm cells that are not embedded in a dense extracellular matrix might disperse more easily from the bioﬁlm , and subsequently contaminate food products more easily . 
More information about in situ bioﬁlm formation and its characteristics is required before these questions can be answered . 
In conclusion , it has been demonstrated that bioﬁlm forming behavior is affected by environmental conditions such as temperature and the culture medium , but also that it is associated with strain origin . 
In addition , it was shown that curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose contribute speciﬁcally to bioﬁlm production under low nutrient conditions at ambient temperatures and that other components are conceivably more important during bioﬁlm formation at 378C and/or in nutrient-rich conditions . 
However , further research is needed to identify these components . 
In addition , the present ﬁndings on extracellular matrix production provide good opportunities for studying the effects of the absence or presence of an extracellular matrix on the survival of S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms during disinfection treatments , and may therefore contribute to the development of more eficient disinfection strategies .
