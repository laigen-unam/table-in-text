Abstract Decreased expression ( twofold ) of a putative yehUTS operon of which yehUT encodes a putative YehU / YehT two-component system in the ompR mutant from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) GIFU10007 under hypotonic growth condition was observed by qRT-PCR . 
Puriﬁed recombinant protein OmpRHis6 of GIFU10007 was shown to bind the upstream region of the yehU gene by the gel-shift assay . 
In addition , the yehT deletion mutant ( DyehT ) displayed differential expression ( twofold or higher ) of 26 genes under the condition by the DNA microarray analysis . 
Altogether , OmpR might regulate the YehUT system in S. Typhi under hypotonic growth condition .

Introduction
The two-component system ( TCS ) is the most prevalent form of signal transduction enabling bacteria to alter cellular behavior in response to environmental cues [ 5 ] . 
TCS is composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase ( HK ) that perceives environmental stimuli and a cognate cytoplasmic response regulator ( RR ) [ 25 ] . 
On the basis of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) MG1655 genome sequence , a total of 30 HK , each containing the conserved selfphosphorylation domain , and a total of 32 RR , each containing the conserved receiver domain , have been predicted [ 17 ] . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) have many putative TCSs similar with that of E. coli through comparing these two gram-negative bacteria genomic sequence . 
To date , there are many studies about these TCSs , such as EnvZ/OmpR , PhoQ/PhoP , PmrB/PmrA and so on in S. Typhi . 
For instances , the ﬁrst discovered EnvZ / OmpR of S. typhimurium is responsible for osmotic regulation of outer membrane protein composition [ 11 ] . 
EnvZ of E. coli is a membrane-bound sensor kinase , although the signal it senses is not known . 
OmpR of E. coli is a cytosolic RR , which binds to the promoter region of the porin genes such as ompF and ompC to affect their expression [ 7 ] . 
Previous study showed that the YehU/YehT encoded by yehUT cluster was a putative TCS in E. coli and YehU may be a sensor and YehT may be a RR [ 12 ] . 
In addition , it has been reported that the regulator gene yehT conferred moderate deoxycholate and crystal violet resistance , and low-level fosfomycin and imipenem resistance in E. coli KAM3 , which is a mutant lacking an acrB gene which encodes an inner membrane component of a major multi-drug efﬂux pump AcrAB-TolC [ 12 , 13 ] . 
The YehU/YehT of S. Typhi is predicted a putative TCS through analyzing sequence of yehUT cluster [ 2 ] . 
To the best of our knowledge , there is no report about this putative YehU/YehT TCS and the relationship between this putative TCS and EnvZ/OmpR TCS in S. Typhi . 
Recently , we found that the expression of gene yehU in the ompR deletion mutant of S. Typhi ( DompR ) under hypotonic growth condition was decreased obviously through analysis of the global gene expression proﬁles by using ORFeome-based S. Typhi whole genome DNA microarrays ( data unpublished ) . 
We hypothesized that the putative YehU/YehT TCS might be regulated by OmpR in

S. Typhi . 
To clarify this hypothesis , the expression of putative operon yehUTS in the DompR under hypotonic growth condition was investigated by qRT-PCR . 
At the same time , OmpR of S. Typhi was prepared and used to perform the gel mobility shift assay experiment with the promoter region of putative operon yehUTS in order to demonstrate the possible relation between these two TCSs . 
In order to study the possible function of the putative YehU/YehT TCS at low osmolarity , we constructed the putative regulator gene yehT deletion mutant of S. Typhi ( DyehT ) , and compared the global transcriptional differences between wild-type strain and DyehT under hypotonic growth condition by using a genomic DNA microarray of S. Typhi . 
This study ﬁrst revealed that OmpR might regulate the putative YehU/YehT TCS in S. Typhi under hypotonic growth condition . 
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids
S. Typhi GIFU10007 , a z66-positive wild-type strain was used in this study [ 27 ] . 
Mutants and plasmids used in this study were listed in Table 1 . 
S. Typhi were cultured in the aerobic condition at 37 C with shaking at 200 rpm in the hypotonic medium ( 1.0 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , 50 mM NaCl , pH = 7.0 ) to simulate low environmental osmolarity . 
Investigation of the Expression of Putative Operon yehUTS in the DompR Under Hypotonic Growth Condition by qRT-PCR
S. Typhi GIFU10007 and the DompR , which were cultured overnight at 37 C in the hypotonic medium , were respectively cooled on ice for 20 min and harvested by centrifugation ( 4,0009 g for 10 min at 4 C ) . 
Total RNA was then extracted with an RNeasy Mini Spin Column ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The quantity and quality of the extracted RNAs were checked with an ND-1000 Spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , USA ) . 
To remove any traces of DNA , the extracted total RNA was treated with 1 U of RNase-free DNase I ( TaKaRa , Japan ) at 37 C for 10 min and then incubated at 85 C for 15 min to inactivate the DNase . 
Three pairs of primers speciﬁc for yehU , yehT and yehS were designed for qRT-PCR and were listed in Table S1 . 
Reverse transcription was primed with random octomer N8 and the SuperScript II kit ( Invitrogen ) was used according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
Each 20 ll reaction contained 2 lg of total RNA and 10 nmol of the random octomer . 
One microliter of reverse transcription product was subjected to a quantitative PCR assay with the above speciﬁc primers as previously described [ 23 , 24 ] . 
Each experiment was performed with four RNA samples obtained from four independent experiments . 
Gene Cloning, Expression and Puriﬁcation of the Protein OmpR From S. Typhi
A primer pair , P-ompR-A and P-ompR-B , speciﬁc to upstream and downstream regions of the gene ompR was designed ( Table S1 ) and used to amplify ompR with pfu DNA polymerase ( Fermentas ) using a PCR System ABI 2700 ( Applied Biosystems 2700 ) and the following temperature program : 94 C for 5 min ; 30 cycles consisting of 94 C for 30 s , 55 C for 30 s and 72 C for 90 s ; and 72 C for 5 min . 
The NdeI site and XhoI site were added to the 50-termini of primers P-ompR-A and P-ompR-B , respectively . 
The amplicon near 600-bp in length was inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pET22b to construct the recombinant plasmid ( pET22bompR ) . 
The correct construction of the vectors was conﬁrmed by sequencing . 
Finally , the recombinant plasmid pET22bompR was transformed into the strain E. coli JM109 strain and veriﬁed by sequencing analysis . 
A single colony of E. coli JM109 carrying the vector pET22bompR was inoculated into 1 ml Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth containing ampicillin at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 lg/ml in a test tube with shaking at 200 rpm at 37 C overnight . 
Subsequently , 50 ml LB broth were inoculated with 500 ll of the culture ( dilution 1:100 ) containing ampicillin to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 lg/ml and incubated with shaking at 200 rpm at 37 C . 
At an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm , expression of OmpR was induced for 3 h by addition of isopropyl-b-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mmol/l . 
The supernatant and cellular fractions were separated by centrifugation at 10,0009 g for 30 min at 4 C. Cell pellets were resuspended with water and ultrasonicated for 30 min at 240 W with a Sonicator ( XL2020 , Misonix Incorporated , USA ) . 
Then the supernatant and precipitate were separated by centrifugation at 4 C . 
The precipitate was resuspended with 50 ll phosphate buffered saline . 
The proteins of above supernatant and precipitate were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . 
Since the C-terminal portion of recombinant protein OmpR carried 6 His tag , a Ni-TED packed column ( MACHEREY -- NAGEL Corporation , Germany ) , in which Ni is the 2 ? 
preferred metal ion for puriﬁcation of His-tagged proteins , was used to purify the fusion protein OmpR according to the manufacturer 's instructions .

Gel Mobility Shift Assay
The DNA fragments for the gel mobility shift assay were ampliﬁed by PCR . 
A primer pair , P-yehU-A and P-yehU-B , speciﬁc to the promoter regions upstream of the putative operon yehUTS was designed and used to amplify the 280 bp DNA fragments containing the promoter of the gene yehU using a PCR System ABI 2700 ( Applied Bio-systems 2700 ) and the following temperature program : 94 C for 5 min ; 30 cycles consisting of 94 C for 30 s , 55 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s ; and 72 C for 5 min . 
Subsequently , the PCR products were detected by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis , and extracted by the DNA gel extraction kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
While , the 180 bp fragments of gene encoding 16 s rRNA of S. Typhi GIFU10007 were ampliﬁed by PCR using the primers ( Table S1 ) and used as control to examine non-speciﬁc binding with OmpRHis6 . 
Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 ll GMS binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris -- HCl , pH 7.5 , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 0.5 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerine ) in the presence of 500 ng PCR products and 0 -- 5 lg OmpR protein . 
Approximately 0.14 lM of each PCR product was incubated with 0 , 1.35 , 2.25 , 4.5 or 9 lM of puriﬁed 
OmpRHis6 for 30 min at room temperature , and then was separated on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.59 TBE buffer ( Tris-borate-EDTA ) at 120 V for 2 h by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . 
The gels were stained with 0.5 lg/ml ethidium bromide at room temperature for 10 min . 
Construction of the DyehT
To generate the DyehT , primer pairs F1A/B and F2A/B were used to amplify the fragments F1 ( 341-bp ) and F2 
( 559-bp ) located upstream and downstream of the gene yehT respectively as previously described [ 22 , 24 , 27 ] . 
Primers used in this study are shown in Table S1 . 
A BamHI site was added to the 50-termini of primers F1A and F2B , and a BglII site was added to the 50-termini of primers F1B and F2A . 
Two fragments F1 and F2 were ampliﬁed from wild-type strain of S. Typhi GIFU10007 and digested with BglII and ligated with DNA Ligation Kit Ver .2 ( TaKaRa ) to form the homologous fragment , in which 420-bp of the gene yehT was absent . 
The fragment was then inserted into the BamHI site of the suicide plasmid pGMB151 , which carried a sucrose-sensitivity gene sacB . 
The wild-type strain GIFU10007 was then transformed with the recombinant suicide plasmid by electroporation . 
The DyehT mutant strain was isolated on the selective plate and veri-ﬁed by PCR and sequencing as described previously [ 15 , 24 ] . 
Transcriptional Proﬁle Assay of the DyehT Under Hypotonic Growth Condition With a Genomic DNA
Microarray
Wild-type S. Typhi GIFU10007 and its mutant strain DyehT were grown with shaking at 37 C in the hypotonic medium to simulate a low osmolarity environment . 
An RNeasy kit ( mini-column , QIAGEN ) was used to extract the total RNA according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ND-1000 Spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , USA ) . 
The extracted RNA was treated with 1 U of RNasefree DNase I ( TaKaRa ) at 37 C for 10 min to remove traces of DNA , and then incubated at 85 C for 15 min to inactivate the DNase . 
cDNA probes were synthesized using 20 lg of RNA . 
We used a genomic DNA microarray containing 4,181 ORFs from the genome of S. Typhi Ty2 . 
Details of this microarray , including primer selection , parameters for primer synthesis , selection of amplicons as well as puriﬁcation and printing of DNA onto slides , were described previously [ 20 ] . 
The ﬂuorescence labeling of cDNA probe , hybridization and microarray scanning were performed as described previously [ 20 ] . 
The data analysis was performed by using GenePix Pro 6.0 software ( Axon Instruments ) [ 4 , 26 ] . 
Results
Investigation of the Expression of Putative Operon yehUTS in the DompR Under Hypotonic Growth Condition by qRT-PCR
Previously , we found that the expression of gene yehU in the DompR at low osmolarity was decreased obviously through analysis of the global gene expression proﬁles by using ORFeome-based S. Typhi whole genome DNA microarrays ( data unpublished ) . 
In this study , the expression of putative operon yehUTS in the DompR at low osmolarity was analyzed by qRT-PCR with speciﬁc prim-ers . 
Compared with the wild-type strain , the expression of gene yehU , yehT and yehS reduced twofold , 2.2-fold and 1.9-fold , respectively in the DompR under hypotonic growth condition ( data not shown ) . 
This result indicates that the expression of putative operon yehUTS at low osmolarity is associated with the positive regulation of OmpR . 
OmpR can Bind the Promoter Fragment of Putative Operon yehUTS in S. Typhi
The gene ompR of S. Typhi GIFU10007 was successfully cloned into the cloning sites NdeI and XhoI of the expression vector pET22b . 
The recombinant plasmid pET22bompR was transformed into the E. coli JM109 strain and veriﬁed by sequencing . 
After induction by IPTG , the protein OmpRHis6 was expressed abundantly and appeared in the supernatant ( Fig. 1a , lane 3 ) as well as in the cell pellet ( Fig. 1a , lane 5 ) . 
The protein OmpRHis6 in the supernatant was puriﬁed by a Ni-TED packed column as shown in Fig. 1a lane 6 . 
DNA fragments containing the upstream region of putative operon yehUTS were ampliﬁed by PCR successfully and used in gel mobility shift assays . 
As shown in Fig. 1b , puriﬁed OmpRHis6 can bind the upstream regions of putative operon yehUTS and can not bind the DNA regions from 16S rRNA of S. Typhi GIFU10007 . 
These results strongly indicate that OmpR may directly regulate the putative operon yehUTS in S. Typhi . 
Transcriptional Proﬁle Assay of the DyehT Under Hypotonic Growth Condition
To study the possible function of yehT at low osmolarity , the global transcriptional differences between wild-type strain and DyehT were assayed by a genomic DNA microarray of S. Typhi . 
The results showed that 26 genes displayed differential expression ( twofold or higher ) between the wild-type strain and DyehT under hypotonic growth condition . 
As shown in Table 2 , the upregulated genes include sprB , sprA , orgA , spaN , spaM , spaI , spaK , invA , invE , invG , invF , aceB , aceA , adiY and sopE , and these genes could be mostly associated with the invasion and virulence of bacteria . 
While argD , astD , astB , narZ , narY , hutH , sucD , sucC , yibK , lctD and acs were downregulated and these genes could be involved in the metabolism of nutrients . 
These results showed that yehT might be involved in the regulation of invasion , virulence and the metabolism of S. Typhi under hypotonic growth condition , and also suggest that YehU/YehT might be a very important putative TCS in S. Typhi .

Discussion
S. Typhi is a gram-negative , enteroinvasive pathogen that causes typhoid fever , and its infection is initiated when Salmonella from contaminated water or food enter the host 's gastrointestinal tract [ 6 , 14 ] . 
Currently , with the development and application of antibiotics , the harm caused by S. Typhi has been greatly reduced . 
However , typhoid fever is still a common disease in tropical and subtropical regions and a lot of drug-resistance strains of S. Typhi have been discovered . 
In recent years , there are still more than sixteen million cases reported annually around the world . 
Even in the United States and other developed countries , typhoid fever still burst occasionally [ 18 ] . 
S. Typhi faces daunting odds during its voyages in the natural environment and through an infected host . 
It must manage stresses such as osmolarity [ 8 ] . 
The osmolarity surrounding Salmonella in food is approximately 50 mM NaCl [ 19 ] . 
Since the iso-osmia is about 150 mM NaCl , the osmolarity in food is a low osmolarity condition for Sal-monella . 
Therefore , the regulation of Salmonella genes in low osmolarity environment is very important for the survival of bacteria . 
Two-component signaling is one of the major modes of signal transduction that bacteria use to sense and respond to the environment . 
The EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system of E. coli has been studied for its involvement in the osmoregulation of porins [ 1 , 10 ] . 
Changes in medium osmolarity profoundly affect OmpF and OmpC expression through OmpR in E. coli : OmpC is preferentially expressed in high osmolarity , whereas OmpF expression is favored in low osmolarity [ 9 ] . 
Our previous study showed that OmpR activates the transcription of ﬂjB : z66 in S. Typhi by promoting ﬂhDC and ﬂiA expression , and indirectly increases the secretion of FljB : z66 by repressing Vi capsular antigen at high osmolarity [ 24 ] . 
In addition , we found that the expression of gene yehU in the DompR was decreased obviously through analysis of the transcription proﬁles by DNA microarrays ( data unpublished ) . 
YehU encoded by yehU is a predicted sensory kinase in the TCS with YehT and there is no report about this putative YehU/YehT TCS of S. Typhi . 
In this study , the results of qRT-PCR analysis showed a decreased expression of putative operon yehUTS in the DompR of S. Typhi at low osmolarity , and suggested that this putative YehU/YehT TCS may be regulated by OmpR and involved in osmoregulation in S. Typhi . 
Gel mobility shift assay is a very useful method to identify the direct relationship between regulatory protein and target nucleic acid . 
In this study , the protein OmpR His6 from S. Typhi was prepared successfully and we carried out gel mobility shift assay experiment to determine whether the putative operon yehUTS is directly activated by OmpR at low osmolarity . 
The results showed that OmpRHis6 could bind the upstream regions of putative operon yehUTS . 
These results ﬁrst indicate that OmpR may directly regulate the putative operon yehUTS in S. Typhi . 
Previous study showed that the osmoregulation was very important for survival , invasion and virulence of S. Typhi [ 21 , 22 ] . 
To investigate the possible function of putative YehU/YehT TCS of S. Typhi at low osmolarity , we con-D structed the yehT and the global transcriptional differences between the mutant and the wild strain were analyzed by the genomic DNA microarray designed for S. Typhi . 
The results showed that some genes possibly involved in the invasion and virulence such as sprBA , orgA , spaNMIK , invAEGF and sopE were upregulated . 
However , some genes probably associated with the metabolism of nutrients , for example , argD , astDB , narZY , hutH , sucDC and acs were downregulated obviously . 
These results suggested that YehT might repress the invasion and virulence , but activate the metabolism of S. Typhi at low osmolarity . 
Transcriptional expression changes of genes associated with the metabolism of substrates are often emerged in bacterial responses to environmental stresses [ 3 , 16 ] . 
Since the low osmolarity environment is a challenge for S. Typhi , survival rather than invasion and virulence is more important for the bacteria in this condition . 
In this study , the results suggested that some genes responsible for metabolism of substrates rather than those involved in pathogenesis in S. Typhi are activated by the putative YehU/YehT TCS at low osmolarity and this conversion provides more energy for the survival of bacteria . 
In summary , this study ﬁrst demonstrated that OmpR might regulate the putative YehU/YehT TCS in S. Typhi under hypotonic growth condition and provided a base for further study on the function of putative YehU/YehT TCS .
