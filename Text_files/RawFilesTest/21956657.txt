Typhoid fever , which is caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphi , is a severe systemic disease that remains a major public health issue in several areas of the world . 
We can model the human disease using mice infected with a related bacterium , Salmonella typhimurium . 
This model recapitulates several clinical aspects of the human disease and allows for the study of the host response to Salmonella typhimurium infection in vivo . 
Previous work in our laboratory has identified three Immunity to typhimurium loci ( Ity , Ity2 and Ity3 ) in the wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice , influencing survival after infection with Salmonella typhimurium . 
The MOLF/Ei alleles at Ity and Ity2 are protective , while the MOLF/Ei allele at Ity3 confers susceptibility . 
In this paper , we have generated a novel cross combination between the highly susceptible strain , MOLF/Ei , and the resistant strain , 129S6 , to better define the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection in MOLF/Ei . 
Using this cross , we have replicated the locus on chr 11 ( Ity2 ) and identified a novel locus on chr 13 ( Ity13 ) . 
Using microarrays and transcriptional profiling , we examined the response of uninfected and infected Ity2 congenic mice . 
These analyses demonstrate a role for both type-1-interferon ( IFN ) and TRP53 signaling in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection .

Introduction
Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria with more than 2500 serovars identified , although only a limited number of serovars are of public health importance . 
In humans , Salmonella enterica are the cause of a broad spectrum of diseases varying from asymptomatic carriage to systemic febrile infection or sepsis . 
The outcome of infection is determined by the serovar causing the infection as well as the genetic predisposition of the infected individual . 
The human-specific serovars Salmonella enterica typhi and paratyphi are the causative agent of typhoid fever , a serious systemic often fatal infection . 
Typhoid fever remains a major public health problem in areas of the world with poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water . 
It is estimated that globally there are 21.5 million cases of typhoid annually resulting in 200 000 deaths .1 In humans , infection with several non-host-specific serovar , including Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis ,

E-mail : danielle.malo@mcgill.ca Received 20 May 2011 ; revised 23 August 2011 ; accepted 29 August 2011 ; published online 29 September 2011 results mainly in a self-limiting acute gastroenteritis ( salmonellosis ) , which is one of the most common and widely distributed food-borne disease .1 Scientific research over the past few decades has proven that both bacterial and host genetic factors influence the outcome of several types of infection .2 Our current understanding of the host immune response to Salmonella infection has been achieved mainly through the use of mouse models mimicking the various stages of infection . 
As Salmonella typhi infects only humans , typhoid fever has been modeled in the mouse using Salmonella typhimurium , a natural pathogen of the mouse . 
Administration of a sublethal dose ( either per os , intraperitoneally or intravenously ) of Salmonella typhi-murium in mice results in a clinical disease that resembles human typhoid fever . 
The infection results in dissemination of the bacteria to the spleen and liver , the main sites of Salmonella replication , resulting in systemic disease and activation of both the innate and adaptive immune system . 
After oral infection , Salmonella typhimurium does not replicate in the intestine of mice , but invades the M cells , which are specialized epithelial cells of the small intestine and colonizes the Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes before spreading into the liver and spleen .3 Several mouse strains ( C57BL/6J , C3H/HeJ , AcB61 and ITY9 ) are unable to control bacterial replication and succumb early during the infection .4 -- 7 Othe strains of mice , such as several 129 substrains , are capable of controlling early bacterial replication and survive the infection .4,8 The wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice are highly susceptible to infection despite the fact that they are capable of controlling bacterial replication in the target organs .9 An initial genome scan in an F2 cross between the two susceptible strains , C57BL/6J and MOLF/Ei , identified three regions linked to the clinical phenotype : Ity and Ity3 on chromosome 1 and Ity2 on chromosome 11 . 
The MOLF/Ei alleles at Ity and Ity3 confer susceptibility to infection , whereas the MOLF/Ei allele at Ity2 confers resistance . 
The molecular basis of Ity was elucidated previously , and the gene conferring resistance to infection in MOLF/Ei is Slc11a1 , initially named Nramp1 .10,11 The existence of Ity2 and Ity3 was confirmed by creating congenic mice carrying each of the locus in isolation .12,13 In the current paper , we have used a novel cross between the highly resistant 129S6 and susceptible MOLF/Ei for linkage analysis . 
In this particular cross , a functional Slc11a1 allele ( Ity ) was present in all F2 progeny . 
Surprisingly , the Ity2 locus was detected despite the resistant background contributed from the 129S6 mice . 
An additional locus named Ity13 was identified on chromosome 13 and MOLF/Ei alleles at this locus result in an increased susceptibility to infection . 
In order to further study the biological contribution of Ity2 to resistance to infection , we used Ity2 congenic mice and a genome-wide microarray analysis to identify important pathways and networks regulated by the Ity2 interval .

Results Identification of a novel locus ( Ity13 ) controlling susceptibility to Salmonella infection in wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice We have previously reported , using a cross between the C57BL/6J and MOLF/Ei mice , the identification of three loci linked to the Salmonella host response in MOLF / Ei mice : Ity on proximal chromosome 1 , Ity2 on chromosome 11 and Ity3 on distal chromosome 1.13 In the current study , we have generated a novel cross using 129S6 mice and wild-derived MOLF/Ei to identify novel susceptibility loci . 
The choice of the strain combination was based on the observation that 129S6 mice are highly resistant to Salmonella infection ( 100 % survival 30 days post-infection ; Figure 1a ) , and also because this parti-cular strain does not carry any known Salmonellasusceptibility genes/loci . 
As observed before , MOLF/Ei were extremely susceptible and developed clinical disease within the first week of infection ( Figure 1a ) . 
Strain 129S6 and wild-derived MOLF/Ei were outcrossed to generate F1 and F2 progeny . 
Both F1 and F2 mice were infected with Salmonella typhimurium and the mice were monitored for a period of 34 days . 
The F1 population showed a survival phenotype identical to the resistant 129S6 parent , while the F2 population showed partial survival with variable time to death ( Figure 1a ) . 
Upon closer examination , the F2 population appears to segregate into distinct groups . 
Mice susceptible to infection did not show a normal distribution of time to death . 
Instead , they could be subclassified into three groups : a group developing clinical disease before day 17 , and two intermediate groups with observed mortality between days 18 -- 22 and days 23 -- 29 . 
A group of mice 
( 22.5 % ) survived towards the end point of the experiment ( Figure 1b ) . 
The F2 distribution is consistent with the results obtained from our previous cross and illustrates the complex nature of the host response to Salmonella infection .13 The F2 frequency distribution suggests that the host response is under the influence of more than one gene . 
There was no effect of sex on the survival of the F2 population , therefore data from males and females were pooled for further analyses . 
A genome scan was done in the F2 population using 121 custom-made single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite markers , spaced approximately at 20 cm interval ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . 
Through a Cox regression model , two loci , one on chromosome 11 and the other on chromosome 13 , were found to be significantly associated with survival time ( Figure 2 ) . 
The most significant peak was seen on chromosome 11 at D11Mit141 ( position 52.9 Mb ; P 1/4 0.0007 ) . 
This region overlaps with the identified proximal region of the Ity2 interval . 
A second locus was identified on chromosome 13 with the peak value at D13Mit19 ( position 43.9 Mb ; P 1/4 0.0046 ) . 
This locus was named Ity13 ( Figure 2 ) . 
Consistent with the previous findings ,13 the mode of inheritance for chromosome 11 is additive , with the

MOLF/Ei allele contributing to resistance ( Figure 3a ) . 
This result confirms the notable effect of the MOLF/Ei allele at Ity2 , as it contributes a resistance allele despite the genetic background contribution from a highly resistant 126S6 strain . 
The Ity13 locus showed an additive mode of inheritance with the MOLF/Ei allele conferring susceptibility ( Figure 3b ) . 
Splenic transcriptional signature in Ity2 congenic mice during Salmonella infection 
We have previously reported that the Ity2 region harbored at least two loci : Ity2A , a proximal region of 22 Mb between D11Mit109 and D11Mit26 , and Ity2B consisting of a 13-Mb distal interval extending from D11Mit5 to D11Mit8 .13 In order to better understand the contribution of the Ity2 locus during Salmonella infection , we examined global gene expression in two congenic mouse strains : B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 mice , which carry the entire Ity2 interval and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice , which harbor only the distal Ity2.B portion of the Ity2 segment . 
These two congenic strains present significantly different survival times following Salmonella infection . 
With the aim of identifying genes differentially regulated upon infection in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD , the relative abundance of transcripts at day 3 post-infection to their levels in the control uninfected tissue was compared . 
Using a combination of statistical filters and hierarchical clustering , the gene list was refined and a total of 361 genes were differentially regulated upon infection in the susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD strain and 173 genes in the more resistant strain , B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 . 
Among those differentially regulated genes during infection , 109 genes were commonly expressed in both the strains ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . 
We examined their gene ontogeny classifications based on PANTHER ( Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships ) to identify biological functions that were regulated during the infection .14 The transcriptional signature common to both the strains consisted of genes known to be involved in the immune response to infection , with a significant number of genes that were regulated by interferon ( IFN ) - g ( Cebpb , Cxcl10 , Gbp1 , Gbp2 , Gbp3 , Gbp4 , Gbp5 , Gbp6 , Gbp10 , Ifit2 , Ifit3 , Ifng , Irf7 and Irg1 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S3 ) . 
Other clusters identified were involved in the early response to infection , including acute-phase proteins ( Saa3 ) , pro-in-flammatory mediators ( Il1b and Il1rn ) and genes implicated in cellular recruitment ( Ccl3 , Ccl4 , Ccl7 , Ccl12 , Ccl24 , Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 ) . 
Some additional genes that were identified have already been shown to have a critical role during the Salmonella infection in vitro and/or in vivo ( Ifng , Cebpb , Gbp5 , Slc11a1 and Usp18 ) .4 In susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD strain , there was an over-representation of genes belonging to additional biological function categories including apoptosis ( Birc5 , Caps4 , and Ppp1r15a ) and cell cycle ( Ccnb1 , Cdc2 , Cdc6 , Cdkn1a , and Cdkn3 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1B and

Several genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism ( Ank1 , Klf1 , Nfe2 , Rhag and Tfrc ) were also upregulated in the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD strain ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . 
All these genes were known to be expressed in the mouse bone marrow and human early erythrocytes expressing the transferring receptor .15 In addition , disruption of several of these genes ( Ank1 , Klf1 , Tfrc and Nfe2 ) has been shown to cause severe anemia .16 -- 21 Another group of genes involved in type 1 IFN signaling ( Ifitm1 , Irf7 , Oas1 , Oas2 , Oasl , Isg15 and Usp18 ) were upregulated in the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD strain . 
A striking difference in the transcriptional response of B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD during infection compared with B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 is the presence of a distinct TRP53 pathway signature ( Figure 4 ) . 
In fact several genes regulated by TRP53 were overexpressed in the susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD . 
The temporal changes of a subset of these genes in the two congenic strains are shown in Figure 4 . 
The level of IFN-related gene expression significantly increased in both mouse strains during infection ( Figure 4a ) . 
Additionally , we noticed that the genes involved in erythropoiesis and those classified within the cell-cycle category and the TRP53 pathway , were predominantly up-regulated within the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD susceptible strain ( Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure S1 ) . 
The transcripts for these genes were unaffected in the resistant strain , while they were significantly more abundant in the susceptible strain during the infection . 
To validate the microarray data , we used quantitative RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) on 13 selected genes including the IFN-regulated genes ( Isg15 , Isg20 , Stat1 , Irf7 , Irf9 and Jmjd3 ) and genes known to be involved in cell cycle , apoptosis and Trp53 regulation ( Cdc2 , E2f2 , Birc5 , Ccng1 , Ppp2a , Pttg1 and Trp53 ) . 
The genes located within the congenic interval on chromosome 11 ( Ccng1 , Ppp2a , Pttg1 , Trp53 and Jmjd3 ) were sequenced in MOLF/Ei to help the design of sequence-specific primers . 
Transcript abundance was evaluated in the spleen of uninfected mice and during infection in both congenic strains ( Figures 5a and b ) . 
The selected genes were detectable at very low levels in uninfected mice although we could observe a tendency for lower mRNA expression for most genes studied in the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD compared with the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 ( Figure 5a ) . 
During infection , the transcription factors , Stat1 and Irf7 , were significantly upregulated in both congenic mice ( P-values o0 .05 ) ) , whereas Irf9 and the IFN-regulated gene , Isg15 , were significantly upregulated only in susceptible congenic mice ( P-value : 0.00013 and 0.00006 , respectively ) . 
The transcription factors STAT1 and IRF9 are part of the transcriptional activator complex ISGF3 , activated by type 1 IFN . 
The increased transcription of Irf7 and Isg15 in the susceptible strain is most likely a reflection of increased translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus and binding to the IFN-stimulated regulatory element present in these two target genes . 
This confirms the involvement of the type 1 IFN signaling pathway in the host response of susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice during infection . 
The qRT-PCR data also confirmed that during Salmo-nella infection in vivo , the Trp53 pathway is dysregulated . 
The expression of Trp53 ( P-value : 0.00301 ) was significantly increased only in the susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice . 
In addition , genes/proteins acting upstream to regulate Trp53 activity , such as E2f2 ( P-value : 0.000 ) , and others acting downstream to mediate Trp53 effects ( Birc5 , P-value : 0.0216 ; Cdc2a , P-value : 0.0315 ) were also significantly upregulated only in the susceptible strain ( Figure 5 ) . 
Expression of genes within the Ity2A region known to regulate Trp53 expression ( Pttg1 , Ccng1 and Ppp2ca ) was also studied . 
Pttg1 ( P-value : 0.00052 ) and Ppp2ca ( P-value : 0.03407 ) were significantly upregulated post-infection in the susceptible strain B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD , while they were mildly downregulated in the resistant strain . 
These analyses confirmed the pattern of up or downregulation observed in the spleen of congenic mice after infection as observed in the microarray analysis ( Figure 5b ) . 
We also studied the expression of the same panel of genes in the liver , which is a major site for Salmonella replication and growth during infection ( Figures 5c and d ) . 
As observed in the spleen , several IFN-regulated genes ( Stat1 , Irf7 , Irf9 and Isg15 ) were significantly upregulated in both B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 following infection . 
A small but significant increase in Trp53 expression was detected in the liver in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD ( P-value : 0.04810 ) , which was not observed in the resistant strain . 
The activity of genes regulated by or regulating TRP53 activity ( E2f2 and Ptgg1 ) was also affected during infection in the liver ( Figure 5c ) . 
Overall , the transcriptional activity in the spleen and in the liver during infection in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD present common signatures .

Figure 4 Box plots showing the expression of a subset of genes from the microarray analysis . 
Genes within the type 1 IFN pathway are shown on the left ( a ) , while genes within the cell-cycle pathway are represented on the right ( b ) . 
All of the genes in panel a are significantly upregulated in the resistant and susceptible strain upon infection ( P-value o0 .05 ) , with the exception of Isg15 and Isg20 which were only significantly upregulated in the resistant strain . 
In contrast to this , all of the genes , except Hist1h2ag and Hist2h2ab in panel b were significantly downregulated during infection in the susceptible stain ( P-value o0 .05 ) , but there was no significant changes seen in the resistant strain . 
Furthermore , there were no significant differences between B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD at day 0 , but all the genes were significantly lower in the susceptible strain as compared with the resistant strain , 3 days post-infection . 
These data illustrate that a subset of genes within the cell-cycle pathway showed differential expression following infection in the susceptible strain B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD as compared with the resistant strain B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 . 
Discussion
Our study reports the identification of loci and pathways involved in the host immune response to Salmonella infection contributed by the wild-derived MOLF/Ei strain background . 
The study design was structured to control for the effect of mutant Slc11a1 that overshadowed minor QTLs ( quantitative trait loci ) identified in the previous crosses using MOLF/Ei .11 We replicated Ity2 , a locus that was identified using an intercross between two strains susceptible to Salmonella infection . 
Consistent with the previous findings , our study showed that the Ity2 MOLF/Ei allele confers resistance to Salmonella infection even in linkage analysis using a cross between MOLF/Ei and the most Salmonella-resistant mouse strain identified to date . 
Additionally , this study identified a locus on chromosome 13 ( Ity13 ) where the MOLF/Ei allele contributes to increased susceptibility to infection in an additive model of transmission . 
A suggestive Salmonella-susceptibility locus was previously reported in this location that explained 3 % of the phenotypic variance and presented a recessive mode of transmission .11 We did not know at that time whether the two loci are identical or not , but it is clear that the impact of chromosome 13 MOLF/Ei alleles on susceptibility to infection is much stronger in the current cross . 
An additional Salmonella-related locus , modifier of Salmonella typhimurium susceptibility 4 , has been mapped to this region and modulates acute inflammatory reactions .22 We chose to further characterize the Ity2 locus because of the availability of congenic and subcongenic mice . 
We showed previously that the two regions within the Ity2 interval ( Ity2A and Ity2B ) were necessary for the resistance of B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 mice to infection on an Slc11a1-corrected C57BL/6J background .13 This led us to hypothesize that gene ( s ) within one segment must regulate the effect of gene ( s ) within the other segment . 
We have used microarray analysis to study the major biological pathways involved in disease progression in Ity2 congenic strains , with the hypothesis that biological knowledge about pathways regulated by Ity2 may help the identification of the underlying genes and mechan-isms involved in Salmonella pathogenesis . 
We focused on major pathways , which showed differential regulation between two Ity2 congenic strains showing resistance ( B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 ) or susceptibility ( B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD ) to infection . 
A dominant transcriptional signature pre-sent in both the congenic strains involved transcripts that mediate inflammation including Il1 and several IFN-g-inducible genes . 
This type of signature appears to be common among different strains of mice during Salmonella typhimurium infection in vivo .4,6,9 The set of genes defined in our analysis was also shown to be induced in several human cell types in response to different pathogens in vitro , and were suggested to belong to a common host response signature .23 In addition , the importance of the interleukin-12 / IFN-g axis in the host response to Salmonella-induced systemic disease in mice24 -- 26 and salmonellosis in humans27 is well known . 
Additional data to support these observations came from recent publications reporting the induction of large proportion of genes induced by IFN-g in the peripheral blood of patients during the acute phase of typhoid fever .28 In the most susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD congenic strain , three clusters of genes showed significant specific profiles . 
They include genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism , type 1 IFN-inducible genes and genes regulated by TRP53 . 
The increased abundance of erythropoiesis-related transcripts in susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice was most likely related to an increase in the reticulocyte population of the spleen in these mice . 
We have previously observed that highly susceptible mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium develop anemia concomitantly with extra-medullary hematopoiesis in the liver and the spleen .6,29 In humans , the presence of anemia during Salmonella typhi infection is well documented and correlates with reduced abundance of genes associated with erythroid differentiation in the peripheral blood .28 The second specific signature observed in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD involved upregulation of type 1 IFN signaling . 
We have shown recently that increased type 1 IFN signaling is detrimental during Salmonella infection in the mouse .4 In addition , a correlation between the increase in blood type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts and disease severity has been recently reported in patients with active tuberculosis supporting an important role for type 1 IFN in the pathogenesis of intracellular bacterial infections in mouse models of human diseases and in humans .30 Finally , the third cluster showing transcriptional dysregulation in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD involves the TRP53 pathway ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . 
Trp53 is a tumor suppressor gene known to balance cell survival and death in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stress signals . 
In response to stress signal , TRP53 protein is activated by post-translational modification leading to either cell-cycle arrest or cellular apoptosis .31,32 Viral infections have also been shown to affect TRP53 activity by inducing type 1 IFN-mediated Trp53 mRNA upregulation .33 -- 35 On the other hand , TRP53 activation enhances IFN signaling .36 During Salmonella infection , we observed both an increase in type 1 IFN expression and enhanced Trp53 transcription . 
It is not possible at the moment to determine if Trp53 upregulation was a direct , or indirect ( through type 1 IFN signaling ) consequence of infection . 
Interestingly , Trp53 is located within the Ity2B region and we observed a difference in the expression of Trp53 between the two congenic strains during the infection , despite the fact that both strains carry the same MOLF/Ei allele at the Trp53 gene , suggesting that gene ( s ) located within the most Ity2 proximal region ( Ity2A ) is ( are ) affecting the expression of Trp53 ( Figure 6 ) . 
There are candidate genes within the Ity2A region that may influence directly or indirectly Trp53 expression and/or activity , including Irf1 , Ccng1 , Ppp2ca and Pttg1 . 
Irf1 has an important role in type 1 IFN signaling and together with Trp53 , it regulates Cdkn1a ( p21 ) gene expression to promote the cell-cycle arrest .37 During Salmonella infection , increased Trp53 expression is paralleled by upregulation of genes within the Ity2A region , including Ccng1 and Pttg1 , two genes known to serve as negative regulators of TRP53 activity . 
CCNG1 interacts with PPP2CA and dephosphorylates MDM2 , resulting in degradation of TRP53 ,38 and PPTG1 binds to Trp53 to inhibit Trp53 transcriptional activity37 and Trp53-mediated cell death .39 Despite increased expression of these two Trp53 negatively regulating genes , levels of Trp53 remain elevated in the Salmonella-susceptible congenic mice . 
Additionally , Trp53 can direct E2f2-mediated growth arrest involving the target gene Gadd45 .40 E2f2 and Gadd45 are two genes that were upregulated in the Salmonella-susceptible B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD congenic strain , which further supports the hypothesis that in B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD , cells are maintained in a cell-cycle arrest state . 
It has been documented that other bacterial pathogens have elaborated sophisticated mechanisms to block cell-cycle progression to favor conditions for colonization and/or dissemination .41 -- 43 We showed here that Trp53 expression is affected by specific Ity2A genomic context , and we speculate that its impact on resistance to Salmonella infection is explained by favoring a cell-cycle arrest state allowing the bacteria to proliferate more successfully . 
Therefore , we conclude that the MOLF/Ei allele at Ity2 maintains the levels of Trp53 expression within a range that allows control of bacterial growth during infection , a situation that is beneficial to the host .

methods
Classical inbred 129S6/SVEvTac ( 129S6 ) and wildderived inbred MOLF/Ei mice were obtained from Taconic ( Germantown , NY , USA ) and the Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) , respectively . 
These parental inbred mouse strains were outcrossed to produce the F1 generation , which were further intercrossed to produce the F2 . 
C57BL/6J mice ( Jackson Laboratories ) were used as susceptible controls for infection . 
Subcongenic mice were previously developed in our laboratory by transferring the entire MOLF/Ei Ity and Ity2 region onto a C57BL/6J background . 
The resulting congenic mice ( B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 ) carry a functional MOLF/Ei allele at the Slc11a1 gene in addition to the MOLF/Ei genomic interval at the Ity2 locus . 
Subcongenic B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD mice were also developed carrying the distal region of Ity2 .13 After infection , the B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 mice were more resistant to infection with a mean survival time of 11.1 ± 1.1 days while B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD had a reduced survival with a mean survival time of 7.9 ± 0.4 days .13 All the mice were housed at the Montreal General Hospital Research Institute Animal Facility in accordance with the conditions specified by the Canadian Council on Animal Care , and the Animal Use Protocol was approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee . 
In-vivo Salmonella infection
Mice aged 6 -- 16 weeks were infected with Salmonella typhimurium strain Keller as described previously .13 Briefly , mice were inoculated with 0.2 ml of physiological saline containing 103 colony-forming units of the bacteria through the caudal vein . 
The infectious dose was verified by serial dilutions on trypticase soy agar . 
Mice that survived until the end point of 34 days were considered resistant . 
Genotyping
DNA was isolated from tail biopsies using overnight digestion in a lysis buffer containing proteinase K ( 10 nM Tris , 2 mM EDTA , 0.5 % SDS , 0.4 M NaCl and 0.2 mg ml 1 proteinase K ) , followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction . 
The concentration of the DNA was measured using the Quant-iT DNA Assay Kit ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Burlington , ON , Canada ) and was adjusted to 30 ng ml 1 . 
Genotyping was done using a custom panel consisting of 60 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 61 microsatellite markers ( Supplementary Table S1 ) , which were identified using publicly available databases .44,45 The single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre using the Sequenom iPlex Gold Technology , while conventional polymerase chain reaction was used for microsatellite amplification in F2 progeny . 
The PCR products were resolved on a 3 - % highresolution agarose gel ( BioShop Canada Inc. , Burlington , ON , Canada ) . 
Genetic analysis
In order to test for the association between survival time after infection and the different chromosomal regions , we used Cox proportional hazards regression at the markers . 
Genome-wide empirical P-values were obtained by bootstrapping using 10 000 resamples . 
A peak region with P-value lower than 0.01 ( which corresponds to a log10 value of 2 ) was considered to be significantly linked to survival . 
Computations were carried out in the software package R. 46 
Materials and Animals used 
Microarray analysis
RNA was extracted from the spleen of uninfected controls , as well as B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2 . 
( Salmonella-resistant ) and B6.MOLF-Ity / Ity2.RecD strains ( Salmonella-susceptible ) 3 days post-infection . 
The RNA extraction was carried out using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen Canada Inc. , Bur-lington , ON , Canada ) . 
Three age-matched mice were used per group . 
The concentration of the RNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) and integ-rity of the RNA was confirmed using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis . 
All hybridization and scanning of mice microarrays were carried out at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre using the Illumina BeadArray technology ( Illumina Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 
The data from the microarray were analyzed using FlexArray .47 They were normalized using a Lumi algorithm ( Illumina ) with Robust Multichip Average background correction . 
The data were further refined by carrying out a Cyber t-test comparing the expression data from the infected samples with the uninfected samples .48 This approach allowed us to generate a profile of the genes differentially regulated in each mouse congenic strain upon infection . 
Several genes located within the chromosome 11 genetic interval were further validated using qRT-PCR because of potential hybridization problems due to the high genetic diversity observed between MOLF/Ei and classical inbred strains . 
These gene lists were further refined using a false discovery rate algorithm ( Benjamini Hochberg ) . 
Genes with an FDR P-value of less than 0.2 and fold change greater than twofold were used to generate final lists of genes for each of the mouse strain .49,50 These list of genes , which represented the genes differentially regulated in each strain upon infection , were further studied using various bioinformatics tools . 
PANTHER ( Protein ANa-lysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships and Ingenuity Pathway analysis ) were used to identify the main pathways involved in both the strains following infection .14,51 The gene lists were also used to generate heat maps using MultiExperiment Viewer .52 
PCR
Based on the microarray results , selected genes were validated using the qRT-PCR . 
Following the spleen and liver RNA extraction , a DNase step was carried out using DNase enzyme supplied by Fermentas ( Burlington , ON , Canada ) . 
Complementary DNA was generated from DNase-treated spleen RNA samples using the Invitrogen complementary DNA synthesis Superscript II RT kit . 
PCR amplification was done using Chromo-4 real-time detector apparatus ( BioRad , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) or the Applied Biosystem StepOnePlus apparatus ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) ; using the SYBR Green based detection kit ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 
All samples were run in duplicate along with two housekeeping genes , Tbp and Hprt . 
All reactions were done at an annealing temperature of 60 1C . 
qRT-PCR data were analyzed using the 2 ( Delta Delta C ( t ) ) method .53 Significance was established using a cutoff of P-value p0 .05 .
