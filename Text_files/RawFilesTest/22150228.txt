Abstract 
Department of Microbiology , Third Military 
TonB-dependent transporters ( TBDTs ) are bacterial outer membrane proteins that are usually involved in the uptake of certain key nutrients , for example iron . 
In the genome of Salmonella enterica ssp . 
enterica serovar Typhi , the yncD gene encodes a putative TBDT and was identiﬁed recently as an in vivo-induced antigen . 
In the present study , a yncD-deleted mutant was constructed to evaluate the role of the yncD gene in virulence . 
Our results showed that the mutant is attenuated in a mouse model by intraperitoneal injection and its virulence is restored by the transformation of a complement plasmid . 
The competition experiments showed that the survival ability of the yncD-deleted mutant decreases signiﬁcantly in vivo . 
To evaluate its vaccine potential , the yncDdeleted mutant was inoculated intranasally in the mouse model . 
The ﬁndings demonstrated a signiﬁcant immunoprotection against the lethal wild-type challenge . 
The regulation analysis showed that yncD gene promoter is upregulated under acidic condition . 
The present study demonstrates that the yncD gene plays an important role in bacterial survival inside the host and is suitable for the construction of attenuated vaccine strains as a candidate target gene .

Introduction
TonB-dependent transporters ( TBDTs ) are transporter proteins located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria . 
They are dependent for their function on contact with the TonB complex , which transduces the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to energize substrate transport through speciﬁc TBDTs across the outer membrane ( Schauer et al. , 2008 ) . 
The TonB system , including the TonB complex and TBDTs for key nutrients such as iron and nickel , is of great medical relevance because the survival of pathogenic bacteria in their hosts depends on their capability to take up these nutrients ( Perkins-Balding et al. , 2004 ; Miethke & Marahiel , 2007 ; Schauer et al. , 2007 , 2008 ) . 
In the genome of Salmonella enterica ssp . 
enterica ser-ovar Typhi Ty2 ( S. Typhi Ty2 ) , six genes encode TBDTs -- fepA , iron , cirA , foxA , btuB and t1497 . 
The homologous gene of t1497 is designated as yncD in Escherichia coli , hence the gene name is used as such throughout this paper . 
The functions of these genes have been determined experimentally except for yncD . 
The products of fepA and iron are receptors of ferric enterobactin and colicins B and D. CirA is a receptor protein for siderophores ( coli-cin IA , IB and V ) and microcins ( E492 , H47 and M ) . 
FoxA is a ferrioxamine B receptor . 
BtuB is a vitamin B12 ( cobalamin ) transporter . 
These ﬁve characterized TBDTs are required for the virulence of Salmonella , with the exception of BtuB ( Sampson & Gotschlich , 1992 ; Kingsley et al. , 1999 ; Rabsch et al. , 2003 ) . 
To date , no direct functional study has been conducted on yncD ; however , it was mentioned in several studies . 
In a previous study , YncD protein was identiﬁed as an in vivo-induced antigen in S. Typhi Ty2 ( Hu et al. , 2009 ) . 
In an assay to screen pH-regulating genes in E. coli , yncD gene expression was showed to be regulated by pH stresses and its highest expression was induced at pH 5.0 ( Maurer et al. , 2005 ) . 
In a DNA microarray analysis of the heat - and cold-shock stimulons in Yersinia pestis , the transcription of the yncD gene was identiﬁed to be enhanced 12.5-fold after heat-shock ( Han et al. , 2005 ) . 
Marchal et al. ( 2004 ) reported a putative PmrA binding sequence upstream of the yncD gene in S. enterica ssp . 
enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) . 
The binding sequence also exists upstream of the S. Typhi yncD gene , which indicates that the expression of the yncD gene may be regulated by the PmrAB system . 
The PmrAB regulatory system responds to acid and ferric iron , and is required for resistance to cationic antibiotic polymyxin B ( Roland et al. , 1993 ) and Fe - mediated killing ( Wösten et al. , 3 + 2000 ) . 
These indirect studies suggest that the yncD gene may be a stress gene subject to regulation by certain conditions , such as acid or heat , and as a putative TBDT , YncD may play a role in bacterial survival in vivo . 
The present study attempts to verify this hypothesis . 
Materials and methods
Strains and growth conditions
The bacterial strains , plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Unless noted , the bacterial strains were maintained in lysogeny broth ( LB ) media . 
A deﬁned a-minimum essential medium ( a-MEM ; Invitrogen ) was used as the basic medium for gene regulation analysis . 
As required , antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : ampicillin 100 lg mL 1 and kanamy-cin 50 lg mL 1 . 
Construction of pYG4 for allelic exchange
A suicide vector for allelic exchange was constructed to facilitate the generation of knockout mutants . 
Two complementary oligonucleotide chains ( M1 and M2 , Table 1 ) , containing multiple clone sites , including EcoRI , XbaI , ApaI , SﬁI , SacI , NotI , SpeI , NdeI , SacII and BglII , were synthesized . 
The two oligonucleotide chains were boiled for 15 min and then annealed . 
After digestion with BglII and EcoRI , the DNA fragment was ligated to a 3599-bp BglII-EcoRI-digested fragment from the pUT-mini-Tn5 plasmid containing ampicillin resistance , a p proteindependent origin , and mob RP4 , resulting in pYG1 . 
A kanamycin resistance cassette from pACYC177 was ampli-ﬁed using primers kana1 and kana2 ( Table 1 ) and then cloned into the ApaI-XbaI site of the pYG1 to generate pYG2 . 
The sacB gene of pYLTAC7 was removed by Eco ¬ 
RI-restriction , generating a 1.7-kb fragment . 
Then , the sacB-containing fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pYG2 resulting in pYG3 . 
Finally , the vector pYG3 was digested by ApalI to remove the ampicillin resistance and was self-ligated to create the ﬁnal plasmid pYG4 . 
Construction of the yncD knockout strain
As described by Link et al. ( 1997 ) , the 2067-bp in-frame deletion of the yncD gene was constructed by cross-over PCR with primers k1 , k2 , k3 and k4 ( Table 1 ) . 
The product was ligated directly to the pMD18-T vector ( Takara Co. , Dalian , China ) and conﬁrmed by sequencing . 
The recombinant plasmid was digested by NdeI and the fragment containing the deletion copy of the yncD gene was ligated to pYG4 . 
The resulting vector was introduced into E. coli S17-1 / kpir by electroporation . 
The hybrid plasmid was transferred into YGC101 ( wild type ) by electroporation to perform mutagenesis . 
Integ-rons were selected from the LB plates containing kanamy-cin and were conﬁrmed through PCR analysis . 
Overnight cultures of the identiﬁed integron grown in the absence of antibiotics were streaked onto LB agar containing 5 % sucrose . 
Selected colonies with normal colony phenotypes were patched onto LB agar with and without kanamycin . 
The colonies that were sensitive to kanamycin were analyzed for the deletion by PCR with the primers O1 and O2 , as well as I1 and I2 ( Table 1 ) . 
The strain carrying the desired deletion was selected and designated as YGC102 . 
Complementation of yncD gene
The gene yncD was PCR-ampliﬁed from the wild-type strain using the primers C1 and C2 ( Table 1 ) , which were designed based on sequences external to the yncD coding region . 
After ampliﬁcation , the DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI and HindIII and ligated to the pBR322 to obtain PYN plasmid . 
The resulting vector was introduced into the mutant strain YGC102 by electroporation to produce the strain YGC103 . 
Virulence in the mouse mucin model
To determine the involvement of yncD in virulence , the median lethal dose ( LD50 ) of YGC101 , YGC102 and YGC103 was determined as described by Wang et al. ( 2001 ) with minor modiﬁcations . 
Female BALB/c mice aged 6 -- 8 weeks ( three mice per group , three groups per strain ) were injected intraperitoneally with various dilutions of the different strains mixed with 7 % ( w/v ) mucin from porcine stomach ( Sigma ) at a ﬁnal volume of 0.5 mL in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
The number of deaths that occurred within 72 h after inoculation was counted . 
The LD50 was calculated as described by Reed & Muench ( 1938 ) .

Bacterial competition test in vivo
To evaluate the effect of yncD gene deletion on the survival capability in vivo , we performed bacterial competition experiments in the mouse model . 
Overnight cultures of YGC101 and YGC102 were harvested , washed twice with PBS , and mixed at an equal density of 
2 9 10 CFU mL with 7 % ( w/v ) porcine gastric 3 1 mucin . 
Three female BALB/c mice were injected intraper-itoneally with the bacterial suspension at a volume of 0.5 mL . 
Twenty-four hours later , the mice were sacriﬁced , injected intraperitoneally with 1 mL of sterile PBS , kept for 1 min with gentle massage over the abdomen and then extracted . 
After serial dilution , the samples were spread on the LB plates and incubated at 37 °C over-night . 
Of the colonies recovered from the same mice , 20 were randomly picked and identiﬁed by PCR with primers O1 and O2 . 
To calculate the competitive indices , the ratio of yncD-deleted mutant to wild type recovered from the abdominal cavity was determined and then normalized by dividing by the ratio of yncD-deleted mutant to wild type in the initial inoculum .

Immunoprotection efﬁcacy
Female BALB/c mice aged 6 -- 8 weeks ( ﬁve groups with three mice per group ) were immunized once intranasally with 10 CFU of YGC102 or PBS ( as control ) . 
Thirty 9 days later , the mice of the control group were challenged with 10 CFU of wild type , whereas the mice of the other 3 four groups were challenged respectively with 10 , 10 , 4 5 10 and 10 CFU of the strain using the porcine gastric 6 7 mucin model as described above . 
The survival of the mice was monitored for 7 days . 
The yncD-deleted mutant is attenuated in the 
mouse mucin model 
Regulation analysis of yncD gene promoter
A promoterless egfp gene from pEGFP-N2 was isolated by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pBR322 plasmid , resulting in the pBGPL plasmid . 
The yncD promoter region was ampliﬁed by PCR using the primers EPR1 and EPR2 ( Table 1 ) . 
The promoter fragment was ligated directly with PMD18-T vector and subcloned as NcoI fragments into the corresponding sites of pBGPL resulting in the pBGP plasmid . 
The generated plasmid was electroporated into the YGC101 strain to generate YGC104 strain . 
The YGC104 strain cells were inoculated into the indicated media ( for the heat-shock experiment , cells were incubated at 45 °C for 10 min ) and grown at 37 °C for 5 h to allow expression of enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) . 
Then , the bacteria were diluted with PBS and analyzed in a ﬂow cytometer ( BD FACSCanto II ) with the gates set to forward and side scatters characteristic of the bacteria . 
The optical detector FL1-H was used for this measurement . 
For each condition assessed , 10 000 bacterial cells were analyzed and the mean ﬂuorescent intensity of the bacteria was obtained . 
Each experiment was performed in triplicate . 
Comparisons of expression values among the groups were performed by t-test .

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from bacterial cells of Ty2 wild type incubated under each condition using the SV Total RNA Isolation System ( Promega ) . 
Additional treatments with RNase-Free DNase I ( Takara ) were performed to eliminate any genomic DNA . 
The quantity and quality of the total RNA was determined with an ND-1000 spectro-photometer ( NanoDrop ) . 
The cDNAs were synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Takara ) . 
Real-time PCR reactions were performed in a Rotor Gene 3000 real-time PCR instrument ( Corbett Research ) using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit ( Takara ) . 
The primers are listed in Table 1 . 
Real-time cycling conditions were as follows : 95 °C for 30 s ; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s , 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in triplicate . 
The transcriptional levels of yncD gene were normalized to the transcripts of a housekeeping gene , rpoD , which served as an internal control . 
Results
The YncD protein of S. Typhi Ty2 is annotated as a TBDT in NCBI , which was conﬁrmed with our bioinformatics analysis ( Supporting Information , Appendix S1 ) . 
To verify whether YncD plays a role in pathogenesis , a yncD deletion mutant was constructed by homologous recombination using a suicide vector pYG4 ( Fig . 
S1 ) . 
The LD50 of S. Typhi Ty2 and its yncD deletion mutant were measured using the mouse mucin model . 
As shown in Table 2 , the DyncD mutant is 1000 times less virulent than the wild-type strain . 
When the pBR322 plasmid carrying the intact yncD gene with its native promoter was transformed into the mutant , the virulence was almost completely restored . 
These data show that the deletion of the yncD gene results in attenuation . 
To understand why yncD knockout leads to reduced virulence , we determined the growth characteristics of the LB media-cultured YGC101 , YGC102 and YGC103 . 
Fig . 
S2 shows that the yncD-deleted mutant grows in the LB media as well as the wild-type and the complemented strain . 
The bacterial growth curves showed no signiﬁcant deviation among the three strains . 
However , the competitive indices of the yncD-deleted mutant in the bacterial competition tests is 0.149 ± 0.093 , which indicates a decreased survival capability of the mutant in vivo compared with that of the wild type .

Immunoprotective efﬁcacy of the yncD 
deletion mutant 
As the yncD deletion mutant was attenuated in the mouse mucin model , we examined its vaccine potential . 
Among the mice immunized with the yncD deletion mutant , a protection rate of 100 % was produced in the groups challenged with 10 and 10 CFU of the wild-type strain , 4 5 and a protection rate of 33 % was produced in the group challenged with 10 CFU . 
As all control mice died 2 days 6 after they were challenged with 10 CFU of the wild-type 3 strain , the yncD deletion mutant showed a signiﬁcant immunoprotective effect ( Table 3 ) . 
The yncD gene was supposedly a target of the PmrAB system by an early in silico analysis ( Marchal et al. , 2004 ) . 
The PmrAB regulatory system is required for resistance to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B and Fe - mediated 3 + killing . 
Therefore , the responses of the yncD mutant and the wild-type strain to polymyxin B and Fe - mediated 3 + killing were assessed . 
The results showed that no difference exists between the two strains ( data not shown ) . 
To investigate the regulation pattern of the yncD gene , the yncD promoter region was cloned and inserted into a site before a promoterless egfp gene , which was carried into the pBR322 plasmid . 
The expression of the EGFP reporter fusion was determined by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the wild-type strain under different conditions . 
We also conducted quantitative real-time RTPCR to analyze the transcriptional level of the yncD gene in the wild-type cells under different conditions . 
As shown in Fig. 1a and b , the yncD gene expression showed an acid induction feature . 
However , other conditions such as supplementation with 10 mM FeCl3 , an inducing factor for PmrAB two-component regulatory system in S. Typhimurium ( Marchal et al. , 2004 ) , or heat shock , shown to induce yncD gene expression in Y. pestis ( Han et al. , 2005 ) , have no signiﬁcant effect on yncD gene expression in our experiments . 
The disparity is believed the YGC104 strain were inoculated into the indicated media and grown at 37 °C for 5 h to allow EGFP expression . 
Expression analysis of the EGFP reporter was carried out using ﬂow cytometry .

Bacterial cells were inoculated into the indicated media and grown at 37 °C for 3 h ( for the heat-shock experiment , cells were incubated at 45 °C for 10 min ) . 
Total RNAs were isolated immediately and reverse transcribed to cDNA . 
Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed .

Millimolar magnesium represses the two-component regulatory system PhoPQ , which indirectly represses the PmrAB by reducing the expression of PmrD , which regulates PmrA activity at a post-transcriptional level ( Garcia-Ve ́scovi et al. , 1996 ; Kox et al. , 2000 ; Kato & Groisman , 2004 ) . 
However , as a common activation signal of both the PmrAB and PhoPQ systems , acidic pH had been shown to activate PmrAB in spite of the presence of magnesium ( Perez & Groisman , 2007 ) .

Discussion
Blanvillain et al. ( 2007 ) performed a survey of TBDTs in 226 completely sequenced eubacterial genomes revealing a broad variation in TBDT number in the surveyed bacteria . 
Interestingly , except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , no important human pathogen was found among the bacteria with TBDT-overrepresentation . 
However , many human pathogens , e.g. Borrelia , Chlamydia , Coxiella , Francisella and Legionella , were found among bacteria without TBDT . 
Most of them were human or animal obligate parasites . 
Thus , the number of TBDTs in a bacterial strain seems to depend on the ecological niche diversity of the strain and is inversely related to a close relationship with human or animal , as in parasitism . 
As proteins located on the surface of bacterial cells , TBDTs are undoubtedly antigenic candidates . 
If a pathogen enters a host body , these antigens can induce speciﬁc antibodies that may inhibit the growth , propagation and pathogenesis of the pathogen . 
A large number of TBDTs are seemingly not optimal choices for pathogens if other selections are available . 
However , in some human patho-gens such as S. Typhi , notwithstanding the long process of evolution , six TBDTs are still reserved , indicating their essential role in habitat survival , e.g. in the human body . 
In the present study , we found that deleting the yncD gene of S. Typhi leads to signiﬁcant attenuation in the porcine gastric mucin model . 
The model has been used to evaluate the degree of attenuation of some S. Typhi vaccine strains , CVD 906 , CVD 908 , CVD 908-htrA and CVD 915 ( Hone et al. , 1991 ; Wang et al. , 2001 ) . 
Although the model does not closely mimic the pathogenesis of human typhoid infection , it reﬂects the survival capability of pathogen in vivo . 
When cultured in the LB media , the yncD-deleted mutant showed normal growth , which indicated that the function of YncD is related to 
As an IVI antigen identiﬁed in a previous study using IVIAT method , the regulation of YncD expression usually can be induced in certain conditions encountered in vivo . 
In the genome of S. Typhi , the yncD gene is adjacent to the yncE gene but it has the opposite transcriptional orientation . 
The yncE gene is induced under iron restriction through the action of the global iron regulator Fur in E. coli ; however , the regulator and the iron restriction did not affect the transcription of the yncD gene ( McHugh et al. , 2003 ) . 
Upstream of the yncD gene , a possible PmrAB-box sequence , cattttcttaacttaat , was found , which indicated that the expression of the yncD gene may be regulated by the PmrAB system ( Marchal et al. , 2004 ) . 
In agreement with this anticipation , acidic pH , a main activation signal of the PmrAB system , was proved to induce the expression of yncD gene in the present study . 
The acid condition is an ecological niche that pathogens usually encounter in vivo . 
Enteric pathogens share an oral route of infection ( Gorden & Small , 1993 ; Maurer et al. , 2005 ) . 
During the initial infection , enteric bacteria encounter low pH stresses in the human digestive tract ( Drasar et al. , 1969 ) . 
Successful colonization requires survival through the stomach at pH 1 -- 2 or the intestinal tract at pH 2 -- 7 ( Dressman et al. , 1990 ) . 
The bacteria respond to low pH stresses by regulating gene expression , which maintains internal pH homeostasis ( Gorden & Small , 1993 ) . 
Moreover , low pH is an important inducing factor of virulence genes as well . 
Low pH enhances the expression of numerous virulence factors , such as the ToxRToxT virulence regulon in Vibrio cholerae ( Behari et al. , 2001 ) and the phoP-phoQ regulon of Salmonella enterica ( Bearson et al. , 1998 ) . 
It also enhances expression of genes for ﬂagellar motility and catabolism ( Maurer et al. , 2005 ) . 
Due to lack of information , the exact function of YncD remains unclear . 
However , our study showed that YncD plays a role in the in vivo survival of S. Typhi . 
As the yncD gene knockout signiﬁcantly reduces bacterial virulence and the attenuated strain shows an effective immu-noprotection , the yncD gene is undoubtedly a good candidate gene for the construction of attenuated vaccine strains .
