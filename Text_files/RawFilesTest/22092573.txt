Abstract 
This study was designed to evaluate gene expression patterns of the planktonic and bioﬁlm cells of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella Typhimurium in try-pticase soy broth adjusted to pH 5.5 and pH 7.3 . 
The planktonic and bioﬁlm cells of multiple antibiotic-resistant S. aureus ( S. aureus ) and S. Typhimurium R ( S. Typhimurium ) were more resistant to b-lactams than those of antibiotic-R susceptible S. aureus ( S. aureus ) and S. Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) at S S pH 5.5 and pH 7.3 . 
The relative gene expression levels of norB , norC , and mdeA genes were increased by 7.0 - , 4.7 - , and 4.6-fold , respectively , in the bio-ﬁlm cells of S. aureus grown at pH 7.3 , while norB , norC , mdeA , sec , seg , sei , S sel , sem , sen , and seo genes were stable in the bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus .

Over the last decades , the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections has been rapidly increased because of the repeated and prolonged use of antibiotics , leading to a serious health problem worldwide ( Wegener , 2003 ; Gootz , 2010 ) . 
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become of great concern for public health , which widely appears as frequent outbreaks in recent years ( Boonmar et al. , 1998 ; Van et al. , 2007 ) . 
Therefore , prevention strategies for antibiotic resistance are essential to control the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens . 
However , the discovery and development of novel antibiotics has lagged behind the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens because of the lengthy and expensive processes , requiring phases of clinical investigation trials to obtain approval , and the lack of information on the antibiotic resistance mechanisms ( Yineyama & Katsumata , 2006 ) . 
Therefore , rmation for understanding gene expression patterns ﬁlm cells of antibiotic-resistance pathogens exposed understanding the molecular properties of strains that are antibiotic-resistant is vital for the treatment of diseases associated with antibiotic-resistant pathogens . 
In the natural environments , most bacteria can form bioﬁlms , embedded within a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix consisting mainly of polysaccharide groups ( Flemming & Wingender , 2010 ) . 
The bioﬁlm formation as a bacterial survival strategy leads to increased resistance to heat , acid , preservatives , and antibiotics ( Stewart & William Costerton , 2001 ; Chmielewski &

Bacterial infections can mainly occur after consumption of contaminated foods . 
The ingested bacteria are exposed to acidic stress and bile salt under oxygen-limited conditions during transit through the stomach , the small intestine , and the colon . 
These stress conditions can inﬂuence anti-biotic resistance patterns , bioﬁlm-forming abilities , and virulence properties ( Riesenberg-Wilmes et al. , 1996 ; 
Introduction
Gahan & Hill , 1999 ; Schobert & Tielen , 2010 ) . 
Moreover , antibiotic-resistant bacteria can possibly reside in bioﬁlms and lead to enhanced tolerance to adverse environmental conditions , causing serious infectious diseases ( Gustafson et al. , 2001 ; Langsrud et al. , 2004 ; Ngwai et al. , 2006 ; Kim & Wei , 2007 ) . 
However , there is a lack of information on the bioﬁlm-associated infections involved in altered virulence properties of antibiotic-resistant bacteria . 
Therefore , the objective of this study was to evaluate the gene expression patterns of bioﬁlm and planktonic cells of antibiotic - resistant foodborne pathogens , Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus , when exposed to acidic stress under anaerobic condition . 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Strains of S. aureus KACC13236 and S. Typhimurium KCCM 40253 were obtained from the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection ( KACC , Suwon , Korea ) and the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms ( KCCM , Seoul , Korea ) , respectively . 
Strains of S. aureus CCARM 3080 and S. Typhimurium CCARM 8009 were purchased from the Culture Collection of Antibiotic Resistant Microbes ( CCARM , Seoul , Korea ) . 
All strains were cultured in trypticase soy broth ( TSB ; BD , Becton , Dickinson and Co. , Sparks , MD ) at 37 °C for 20 h . 
The cultured cells were collected by centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min at 4 °C , washed twice with 0.1 % sterile buffered peptone water ( BPW ) , and then used to prepare bioﬁlm cells for assays . 
Bioﬁlm formation assay
The bioﬁlm formation was evaluated based on the ability of strains to adhere to the surface of polystyrene Petri dishes . 
The strains of S. aureus KACC13236 , S. Typhimurium KCCM 40253 , S. aureus CCARM 3080 , and S. Typhimu-rium CCARM 8009 were inoculated at approximately 10 CFU mL in TSB adjusted to a sub-lethal pH of 5.5 6 1 using 1 M HCl and TSB at pH 7.3 as the control . 
The inoculated strains were anaerobically cultured without mechanical agitation at 37 °C for 48 h in a GasPak anaerobic system ( BBL , Cockeysville , MD ) with AnaeroGen ( Oxoid 
Ltd, Hampshire, UK).
Antibiotic susceptible assay
The antibiotic susceptibility of planktonic and bioﬁlm cells was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) procedure ( CLSI , 2009 ) . 
The antibiotic stock solutions were prepared by dissolving them in sterile distilled water at concentrations of 
256 lg mL 1 ( ampicillin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , cefoxi-tin , ceftazidime , cephalothin , oxacillin , and piperacillin ) and serial dilution ( 1 : 2 ) with TSB ( pH 7.3 ) . 
The strains of S. aureus KACC13236 , S. aureus CCARM 3080 , S. Typhimurium KCCM 40253 , and S. Typhimurium CCARM 8009 were anaerobically cultured in TSB at pH 5.5 and 7.3 to obtain planktonic and bioﬁlm cells . 
In accordance with the CLSI procedure , the planktonic and bioﬁlm cells grown in TSB at pH 5.5 and 7.3 were incubated in the diluted antibiotic solutions for 18 h at 37 °C to evaluate the susceptibility of cells to antibiotics . 
Minimum inhibi-tory concentrations ( MICs ) were determined at concentrations at which there was no visible growth . 
The susceptible ( S ) , intermediate ( I ) , and resistant ( R ) strains were deﬁned based on MIC values of < 4 lg mL 1 , between 4 and 8 lg mL 1 , and more than 16 lg mL 1 , respectively ( Hamilton-Miller & Shah , 1996 ) . 
Microbiological analysis
The numbers of planktonic and bioﬁlm cells were estimated using the plate count method . 
For planktonic cell counts , the cell suspensions were collected and the remaining non-adherent cells were rinsed by ﬂooding the plate surface with 10 mL of 0.1 % sterile BPW . 
For bio-ﬁlm cell counts , the attached cells were collected with a cell scraper ( Thermo Scientiﬁc Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and suspended by sonication at 20 kHz for 10 min in 20 mL of 0.1 % sterile BPW . 
The collected cells were serially diluted ( 1 : 10 ) with 0.1 % sterile BPW and the proper dilutions were plated on trypticase soy agar ( TSA ) . 
The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h for enumeration of planktonic and bioﬁlm cells . 
RNA extraction
Each planktonic or bioﬁlm culture ( 0.5 mL ) was mixed with 1 mL of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min . 
The collected cells were used for RNA extraction according to the RNeasy Mini Handbook ( Qiagen ) . 
The ® collected cells were disrupted in a buffer containing gua-nidine isothiocyanate and lysozyme , mixed with ethanol to adjust proper binding conditions , and then loaded into an RNeasy mini column for RNA isolation . 
RT-PCR ampliﬁcation
The cDNA was synthesized as described previously ( Xu et al. , 2010 ) , according to the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription protocol ( Qiagen ) . 
In brief , the RNA sample was mixed with a master mixture containing Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase , Quantiscript RT Buffer , RT Primer 
Mix and RNase-free water , incubated at 42 °C for 15 min , and then immediately incubated at 95 °C for 3 min to inactivate the Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase . 
The cus-tom-synthesized oligonucleotide primers using IDT ( Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. , Coralville , IA ) were used in this study ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . 
The PCR mixture ( 20 lL ) containing 29 QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master ( 10 lL ) , 60 pmol primer ( 0.6 lL ) , cDNA ( 2 lL ) , and RNase-free water ( 6.8 lL ) was ampliﬁed using an iCycler iQ ™ System ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hemel Hempstead , UK ) and denatured initially for 15 min at 95 °C , followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s , 59 °C for 20 s , and 72 °C for 15 s . 
The melt-curve analysis was performed immediately after the ampliﬁcation protocol with 0.4 °C increments per 10 s for 85 cycles from 65 to 97 °C . 
The PCR products were visualized and analyzed using the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system ( Bio-Rad Laboratories ) . 
The comparative Ct method ( Livak & Schmittgen , 2001 ; Xu et al. , 2010 ) was used to analyze the relative expression of targeted genes . 
The untreated cells were cultured anaerobically in TSB ( pH 7.3 ) at 37 °C for 20 h.

The highest bioﬁlm cell numbers 1 were 8.26 and 8.32 log CFU mL for S. aureus CCARM 1 3080 in TBS at pH 5.5 and pH 7.3 after 48-h cultivation , respectively , while the fewest bioﬁlms were formed by S. Typhimurium KCCM 40253 in TSB at pH 5.5 . 
The MICs of the antibiotics ampicillin , aztreonam , cefotax-ime , cefoxitin , ceftazidime , cephalothin , oxacillin , and piperacillin against S. aureus KACC13236 , S. aureus CCARM 3080 , S. Typhimurium KCCM 40253 , and S. Typhimurium CCARM 8009 were determined as shown in Tables 4 and 5 . 
As shown in Table 4 , the planktonic and bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus CCARM 3080 were more resistant to most antibiotics than those of S. aureus KACC13236 . 
Compare to S. aureus planktonic cells , the bioﬁlm cells were highly resistant to most antibiotics . 
The MIC values for ampicillin , cefotaxime , cefoxitin , ceftazidime , oxacillin , and piperacillin were 256 lg mL 1 against the bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus CCARM grown in TSB at pH 5.5 and 7.3 . 
The planktonic and bioﬁlm cells grown in TSB at pH 5.5 were more susceptible to antibiotics than those grown in TSB at pH 7.3 . 
The differences in antibiotic susceptibility between pH 5.5 and 7.3 were especially noticeable for the bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus KACC13236 . 
However , the antibiotic resistance patterns of S. aureus CCARM 3080 were not signiﬁcantly different between the bioﬁlm cells at pH 5.5 and 7.3 , showing MIC values of 128 lg mL 1 to more than 256 lg mL 1 .

Discussion
This study describes the gene expression dynamics of planktonic and bioﬁlm-associated foodborne pathogens with multiple antibiotic resistance proﬁles when grown at different acidic pH ranges under anaerobic conditions . 
As antibiotic resistance is one of the major public health problems worldwide , this study sheds light on new approaches to the understanding of virulence properties of antibiotic-resistant pathogens exposed to stress conditions .

The antibiotic-resistant strains S. aureus and S. Ty-R phimurium grew well in TSB at pH 5.5 compared to the R antibiotic-susceptible strains ( Table 3 ) , suggesting that the antibiotic-resistant strains can adapt better to acidic conditions than the antibiotic-susceptible strains can . 
The acid-adapted cells provide cross-protection against heat , pH , osmolarity , and antibiotics ( Leyer & Johnson , 1993 ; Lee et al. , 1994 ; Greenacre & Brocklehurst , 2006 ) . 
The bio-ﬁlm formation by antibiotic-susceptible strains ( S. aureus S and S. Typhimurium ) was signiﬁcantly inhibited by pH S 5.5 compared to the antibiotic-resistant strains ( S. aur-eus and S. Typhimurium ) ( Table 3 ) . 
The results imply R R that acidic pH can negatively inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation ( Salsali et al. , 2006 ) . 
However , acid-adapted antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be more resistant to other environmental stresses ( Leyer & Johnson , 1993 ; Lee et al. , 1994 ; 
Greenacre & Brocklehurst , 2006 ; McKinney et al. , 2009 ) . 
The MIC values of bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus KACC13236 grown in TSB at pH 5.5 and 7.3 were relatively greater for all antibiotics than the values for planktonic cells ( Table 4 ) , indicating that bioﬁlm cells were signiﬁcantly more resistant to antibiotics compared with the planktonic cells . 
The results are in good agreement with previous reports that bioﬁlm formation was directly associated with the signiﬁcant increase in antibiotic resistance of bacteria ( Donlan & Costerton , 2002 ; Kim & Wei , 2007 ; 
Cho et al. , 2008 ; Kwon et al. , 2008 ) . 
The antibiotic resistance of bioﬁlm cells might be attributed to their structural and physiological properties , leading to the changes in membrane permeability and metabolic activity ( Costerton et al. , 1999 ; Donlan & Costerton , 2002 ; Stewart , 2002 ) . 
Compared to pH 7.3 , the planktonic and bioﬁlm cells grown in TSB at pH 5.5 were highly susceptible to the antibiotics used in this study ( Table 5 ) . 
Acid stress can cause the changes in cellular membrane permeability , leading to increased susceptibility to antibiotics ( Alakomi et al. , 2000 ; Delcour , 2009 ) . 
The norB and mdeA genes were stable in S. aureus and S S. aureus planktonic cells cultured at pH 5.5 ( Fig. 1a ) . 
R The enhanced resistance to multiple antibiotics is mediated by the relative gene expression associated with norB , norC , and mdeA genes in S. aureus ( Huang et al. ,

The gene expression stability of norB , norC , and mdeA in S. aureus planktonic cells may play an important role in antibiotic resistance under anaerobic conditions , resulting in an increased virulence in S. aureus exposed to the gastrointestinal tract . 
Staphylococcal enterotoxins , a family of pyrogenic toxin superantigen-carrying staphylococcal pathogenicity island , are the major causative agents of staphylococcal food poisoning ( Lowry , 1998 ; Becker et al. , 2003 ; Derzelle et al. , 2009 ) . 
The relative expression levels of norB , norC , mdeA , sec , seg , sei , sel , sem , sen , and seo genes were increased 23.9 - , 7.7 - , 2.8 - , 3.4 - , 4.5 - , 6.6 - , 16.4 - , 36.4 - , 6.3 - , and 8.2-fold , respectively , in the bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus grown in TSB at pH 7.3 ( Fig. 1d ) . 
The R efﬂux pump and virulence-related gene expression may be changed during the bioﬁlm formation by S. aureus . 
R 
This conﬁrms a previous report that the antibiotic resistance of bioﬁlm cells contributed to the enhanced virulence ( Rajesh & Vandana , 2009 ; Hoiby et al. , 2010 ) . 
The hilA and lpfE genes were overexpressed in S. Typhimurium and S. Typhimurium planktonic cells cultured in S R TSB at pH 5.5 ( Fig. 2a ) . 
This suggests that the adhesion and invasion ability of S. Typhimurium can be enhanced under acid stress conditions ( Chowdhury et al. , 1996 ) . 
The acrB and tolC genes were stable in S. Typhimurium R grown in TSB at pH 5.5 ( Fig. 2a ) . 
The AcrAB-TolC system is responsible for the increased antibiotic resistance , invasion ability , and virulence ( Piddock , 2006 ; Nikaido et al. , 2008 ; Pages & Amaral , 2009 ) . 
Therefore , the obserR vations imply that S. Typhimurium can effectively extrude antibiotics under acidic stress conditions . 
The AcrAB-TolC pump system can lead directly to multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria ( Piddock , 2006 ) . 
Salmo-nella Typhimurium cells causing foodborne salmonellosis can invade the small intestine , which plays a role in bacterial pathogenicity ( Pfeifer et al. , 1999 ) . 
The stn gene in S. Typhimurium is responsible for the production of enterotoxin ( Chopra et al. , 1994 , 1999 ) . 
In conclusion , this study highlights the differential gene expression of the planktonic and bioﬁlm cells of S. aureus ( S. aureus and S. aureus ) and S. Typhimurium ( S. Ty-S R phimurium and S. Typhimurium ) exposed to acidic S R stress under anaerobic conditions . 
The most signiﬁcant ﬁndings in this study were that ( 1 ) the bioﬁlm cells of multiple antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and S. Typhimurium R R were more resistant to acidic stress compared with the planktonic cells ; ( 2 ) the bioﬁlm-forming ability was increased in S. aureus and S. Typhimurium grown in R R TSB at pH 5.5 and 7.3 ; and ( 3 ) the relative expression of toxin - , virulence - , efﬂux pump-related genes in the bioﬁlm of S. aureus and S. Typhimurium strains was distinct R R from that in the planktonic cells . 
The multiple antibiotic-resistant pathogens ( S. aureus and S. Typhimurium ) R R were more likely to form the bioﬁlm , possibly leading to cross-protection against environmental stresses and enhanced pathogenesis . 
Further study is needed taking molecular approaches to elucidate the relationship between bioﬁlm formation ability and the virulence potential of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens exposed to various environmental stress conditions .
