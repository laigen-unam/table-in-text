Background . 
Invasive nontyphoid Salmonella ( iNTS ) disease is common and severe in adults with human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) infection in Africa . 
We previously observed that ex vivo macrophages from HIV-infected subjects challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium exhibit dysregulated proinﬂammatory cytokine responses . 
Methods . 
We studied the transcriptional response in whole blood from HIV-positive patients during acute and convalescent iNTS disease compared to other invasive bacterial diseases , and to HIV-positive and - negative controls . 
Results . 
During iNTS disease , there was a remarkable lack of a coordinated inﬂammatory or innate immune signaling response . 
Few interferon c ( IFNc ) -- induced genes or Toll-like receptor/transcription factor nuclear factor jB ( TLR/NFjB ) gene pathways were upregulated in expression . 
Ex vivo lipopolysacharide ( LPS ) or ﬂagellin stimulation of whole blood , however , showed that convalescent iNTS subjects and controls were competent to mount prominent TLR/NFjB-associated patterns of mRNA expression . 
In contrast , HIV-positive patients with other invasive bacterial infections ( Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae ) displayed a pronounced proinﬂammatory innate immune transcriptional response . 
There was also upregulated mRNA expression in cell cycle , DNA replication , translation and repair , and viral replication pathways during iNTS . 
These patterns persisted for up to 2 months into convalescence . 
Conclusions . 
Attenuation of NFjB-mediated inﬂammation and dysregulation of cell cycle and DNA-function gene pathway expression are key features of the interplay between iNTS and HIV . 
Invasive nontyphoid Salmonella ( iNTS ) disease is one of the commonest causes of bloodstream infection in adults 
and children across sub -- Saharan Africa where human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) infection is prevalent [ 1 ] .

ment [ 2 -- 4 ] . 
A varied clinical presentation makes iNTS diagnostically challenging [ 3 ] , and a rapid diagnostic 
biomarker test would be valuable . 
There is a paucity of human data to explain the pathogenesis and severity 
of this infection [ 5 ] . 
In the context of HIV in adults , there is a signiﬁcant intracellular stage during the pathogenesis of iNTS [ 6 ] . 
We have previously observed dysregulated proinﬂammatory cytokine responses from ex vivo macrophages from HIV-infected adults challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium , with responses declining in late HIV disease [ 7 ] . 
We hypothesized that the peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) response during acute disease would provide further useful insights into pathogenesis by comparison with other infections . 
This study reports the ﬁrst attempt to proﬁle the global host responses to iNTS in vivo in a large HIV patient group , with the key aim of providing novel insights clarifying the nature of iNTS disease . 
We utilized microarray technology and advanced systems biology analyses [ 8 ] to dissect the transcriptional host responses during acute and convalescent iNTS in the context of HIV , and compared this to other acute invasive bacterial infections in HIV-positive patients and to baseline asymptomatic HIV-positive controls . 
In addition , we used an ex vivo whole-blood stimulation assay based on lipopolysacharide ( LPS ) and ﬂagellin to provide further insight into host responsiveness . 
We discuss the results of these novel in vivo and ex vivo studies of iNTS infection in comparison with previous transcriptional studies in tissue models , 
animal models , and human Salmonella disease [ 9 -- 13 ] . 
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS
Blood Collection and Sample Processing
Venous blood was taken from consecutive consenting febrile 
( .37.5 C axilla ) adults ( .14 years of age ) who were admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital ( QECH ) in Malawi for routine aerobic blood culture ( 5 mL , BacT/Alert , BioMerieux ) [ 4 ] and whole blood RNA stabilization . 
Patients were recruited before antibiotic treatment . 
Subjects whose blood culture was positive for growth of nontyphoid Salmonella ( NTS ) were treated with ci-proﬂoxacin ( 500 mg twice a day [ bd ] ) for 10 -- 14 days , and invited to return for convalescent venesection 4 -- 6 weeks later . 
Consenting asymptomatic , afebrile HIV-positive antiretroviral-naive controls , without other chronic or active disease and who were matched for 
CD4 cell count , were recruited at the QECH antiretroviral clinic . 
Consenting healthy HIV-negative adult controls were recruited among hospital staff and unrelated hospital visitors . 
Blood ( 2.5 mL ) was taken into PAXgene RNA tubes ( PreAnalytiX , Qiagen / 
BD ) and left at room temperature for 2 hours before being stored at 280 C. Full blood count ( FBC ; Beckman Coulter ) , thick-ﬁlm microscopy for malaria parasites , HIV testing ( Unigold , Trinity Biotech ; and Determine , Inverness Medical ) , and CD4 cell 1 counts ( Trucount , Becton Dickinson ) were performed . 
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , United Kingdom ( ref 07.14 ) and by the Malawi College of Medicine Research 
Ethics Committee ( ref P. 03/07/501 ) . 
All participating subjects gave written informed consent . 
For ex vivo stimulation assays , 3 mL fresh blood from afebrile convalescent NTS cases and from controls was collected into sodium heparin ( Vacutainer , Becton Dickinson ) . 
Blood was stimulated with either S. Typhimurium LPS ( 1 lg/mL , Sigma ) or S. Typhimurium ﬂagellin ( 1 lg/mL , Autogen Bioclear ) , or mock-stimulated with PBS for 4 hours at 37 C on a roller , then put in PAXgene RNA tubes , left at room temperature for 2 hours and stored at 280 C. 
Microarrays and Determination of Differentially Expressed Genes
RNA was extracted ( PaxGene Blood RNA Extraction kit , PreAnalytiX , BD/Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
After quality checks , RNA was hybridized on the 
Illumina Human WG-6_V3 array ( 48,803 probes ) . 
Data were normalized ( quantile algorithm for between-array normalization , and median of all samples baseline within-array correction ) , and analyzed using GeneSpring software ( Agilent 
Technologies ) . 
Adjusted P values were calculated using the Benjamini and Hochberg ( BH ) method [ 14 ] . 
For each comparison , differentially expressed ( DE ) genes were deﬁned as having a fold change in gene expression .62 and a false discovery rate ( FDR ) -- corrected P value of ,0.05 . 
Microarray data were deposited at ArrayExpress , EMBL-EBI ( accession number 
E-TABM-856).
Pathway and Gene Ontology Analysis
Illumina probe sequence ID numbers were mapped to NCBI 
RefSeq IDs , and uploaded to InnateDB ( www.innatedb.com ) [ 15 ] with their associated expression data . 
InnateDB is a publicly available , manually curated molecular interaction and pathway database and computational analysis platform for all known human and mouse genes , designed to enable systems biology approaches to investigate all cellular signaling responses , including innate immunity . 
For each comparison , InnateDB pathway and gene ontology ( GO ) analyses were undertaken to determine which pathways or GO terms were statistically signiﬁcantly associated with DE genes using the hypergeometric test . 
The BH FDR correction was applied to correct for multiple testing . 
Molecular Interaction Network Analysis
InnateDB contains a uniquely comprehensive , manually annotated database of experimentally supported molecular interactions , allowing complex interaction networks to be constructed [ 8 , 15 ] . 
Using the list of DE genes uploaded to InnateDB , different molecular interaction networks were constructed , consisting of only the interactions between DE genes ﬁrst , followed by inclusion of all non-DE interacting partners of the DE genes . 
Networks were then submitted to Hub Objects Analyser ( http://hub.iis.sinica.edu.tw/Hubba/ ) [ 16 ] to identify hub proteins ( network nodes that are the most highly connected to other DE genes ) , bottleneck proteins ( network nodes that are key connector proteins in a network , thus being the `` shortest path '' ) , and differentially expressed subnetworks . 
RESULTS
Subjects and Controls
From 112 febrile acute adult admissions , we diagnosed 25 HIV-infected Malawian adults with acute iNTS disease ( median age 30 years , 15 males ) , and 6 HIV-infected adults with `` other '' acute bacterial bloodstream infections ( 3 E. coli , 3 S. pneumoniae , median age 41 years , 2 males ) . 
Fourteen matched HIV-infected controls ( median age 39 years , 5 males ) and 18 healthy HIV-negative controls ( median age 40 years , 9 males ) were recruited . 
Five patients with iNTS died during hospital admission . 
Another 13 were followed up and studied in convalescence 
( median 42 days , range 7 -- 154 days ) . 
None of the follow-up cases had a recrudescence of iNTS . 
No subjects or controls had started antiretroviral treatment . 
Clinical data for subjects are summarized in Table 1 .

Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering of All Acute and Convalescent Events and Controls . 
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all acute and convalescent iNTS and other infection samples , HIV-positive controls , and HIV-negative controls were conducted to produce a dendrogram based on similarities in gene expression proﬁles across all groups , and is shown in Figure 1 . 
This analysis revealed strong groupings of iNTS-infected patients , other bacterially infected patients , HIV-positive controls , and HIV-negative controls . 
The 13 iNTS convalescent cases were distributed among the bacterial infection and control clusters according to length of follow up ; the

Acute iNTS mRNA Proﬁles Lacked Evidence of a
Coordinated Inﬂammatory or Immune Proﬁle . 
InnateDB analysis was used to examine the functional attributes of DE genes among patient groups [ 8 , 15 ] . 
This included analysis of GO terms , signaling and metabolic pathways , and network attributes that were statistically signiﬁcantly overrepresented among DE genes associated with the different patient condifferential gene expression that was attributable to invasive bacterial disease states on a preexisting background of HIV disease . 
There were 1511 DE genes attributable to acute iNTS and 1535 DE genes attributable to other acute bacterial invasive disease , but only 24 % overlap ( 372 genes ) between these groups . 
ditions . 
Figure 2 summarizes the analysis pipeline used to describe the 
Thus , although the responses were of similar magnitude in terms of the number of DE genes , they differed markedly in the type of 
gene that was differentially regulated . 
The DE genes attributable to iNTS disease, examined using
InnateDB , exhibited surprisingly little evidence of a common substantive or coordinated innate immune or inﬂammatory response ( Table 2 ) . 
Although some individual genes relating to inﬂammatory processes were upregulated in their expression , classical GO and pathway analysis revealed few annotated biological processes or pathways related to immunity or inﬂammation as being signiﬁcantly overrepresented . 
Although IFNc mRNA was modestly upregulated , few downstream IFNc-inducible genes showed upregulation . 
Thus , we were unable to identify during iNTS any coordinated host immune response beyond what is already expressed during underlying HIV infection . 
The only statistically signiﬁcantly downregulated GO term in this comparison was `` chemotaxis '' ( involving genes BDKRB1 , CCR3 , CMTM3 , CXCL5 , GPR44 , GPR68 , HRAS , 
IL8RB, and TTC7B).
Acute iNTS Cases Showed Transcriptional Upregulation of
Cell Cycle and DNA Function Genes . 
The term `` cell cycle '' was signiﬁcantly overrepresented in the dataset of genes upre-gulated in acute iNTS in both GO and pathway analyses ( Table 2 ) . 
Other statistically overrepresented GO terms included `` DNA replication , '' `` DNA translation , '' and `` DNA repair . '' 
Pathway analysis similarly identiﬁed viral mRNA translation ( 14 ribosomal proteins ) , and DNA replication as signiﬁcantly upregulated pathways . 
This proﬁle of gene expression may be indicative of cell cycle dysregulation and possibly increased HIV viral replication in iNTS patients . 
Indeed , there are known direct interactions between HIV viral proteins ( Vpr , Tat , and Vif ) and 4 of the cell cycle proteins that were upregulated at the gene expression level ( CCNB1 , CDC25C , YWHAG , and MDM2 ) [ 17 -- 19 ] . 
gene that was differentially regulated . 
( Figure 2 ; Table 2 ) . 
Late convalescent patients , at 3 -- 5 months , had gene expression patterns that were nearly identical to those 
Other Genes With Altered Transcription During Acute iNTS Disease . 
Although the GO and pathway analyses did not identify speciﬁc immune-related pathways as being statistically signiﬁcantly overrepresented in iNTS , there were several individual immune-relevant genes of interest that were signiﬁcantly upregulated during iNTS cases . 
Notably , while REL ( c-Rel ) , an alternative component of the NFjB complex , and TIRAP , an adaptor protein involved in TLR4-NFjB signaling [ 20 ] were upregulated , so were several important regulators or inhibitors of NFjB and inﬂammatory pathways , including NFKBIB ( IjBb , 3-fold ) , STAP2 ( 2.7-fold ) [ 21 , 22 ] , TRAIP ( 2.4-fold ) [ 23 ] , inhibitory regulators of cytokine signaling 
SOCS4 and SOCS7 , and PI3K ( phosphatidyl-3 -- phosphate kinase ) , suggesting mechanisms for the downregulation of in ¬ 
A small number of individual immune-relevant genes were
also signiﬁcantly downregulated in their expression , including SIGIRR ( a regulator of the TLR and IL-1R pathways ) , CSF1 ( MCSF , a key IFNc-inducible cytokine for macrophage activation and differentiation ) , IFNA13 ( IFNa , a key cytokine for the control of HIV viral replication during acute infection [ 24 , 25 ] ) , and TNFRSF10B and TNFRSF6B ( TNF-superfamily receptors ) . 
Overall however , although some individual immune-related genes were differentially expressed in iNTS , there was a notable lack of a coordinate immune/in ﬂammatory response that would be commonly observed in other infections [ 26 ] 
Molecular Interaction Network Analysis in Acute iNTS Cases . 
Pathway and GO analyses rely on known biological pathways and processes to identify coordinated transcriptional proﬁles . 
Network analysis , however , uses known direct molecular interactions to model how differentially expressed genes and their encoded products may interact with each other ; for example , through protein -- protein interactions . 
Network analysis identiﬁes key nodes ( genes/proteins/RNAs ) that are highly interconnected with other nodes and thus may be substantially responsible for driving the observed patterns of gene expression . 
Molecular interaction network analysis of DE genes during iNTS infection , using InnateDB [ 15 ] and Hubba [ 16 ] , identiﬁed NFKBIB ( IjBb ) , a key NFjB inhibitor and negative regulator of inﬂammatory signaling [ 27 ] , as a highly ranked hub protein in the network ( 3-fold upregulated ) , further supporting the suggestion that suppression of NFjB-mediated transcriptional responses may explain the lack of a coordinated inﬂammatory / immune response observed during iNTS disease . 
YWHAG , a 14-3-3c protein that has potential interactions with HIV Vpr protein [ 18 ] , was also a highly ranked hub ( 3-fold upregulated ) . 
Other hubs related to the cell cycle , in agreement with the pathway and GO analyses . 
A Signature mRNA Proﬁle Can Persist for up to 2 Months After iNTS . 
The distribution and pattern of DE genes during early and late convalescence suggested that near-complete resolution eventually occurred , but took up to 3 months to achieve seen in matched HIV-infected controls . 
This provides a reassuring internal control to conﬁrm that iNTS cases and HIV-infected controls were well matched for the biological effects of underlying HIV , and that any changes observed during acute iNTS were truly attributable to iNTS and not to poor matching of controls . 
Patients in the ﬁrst 2 months of convalescence , however ( Table 2 ) , still had 418 DE genes differentially regulated compared with HIV-infected controls , and the pattern of expression revealed by GO and pathway analyses was very similar to that seen in acute disease , suggesting a slow return to baseline despite antibiotic treatment and clinical resolution of their presenting febrile illness .

Comparison to matched HIV-positive control patients was used to dissect the differential gene expression attributable to different bacterial infections on a background of HIV infection . 
This is displayed as a Venn diagram in the lower panel . 
Only the '' late '' convalescent group is shown here ( see Table 2 and text for further description ) . 
The analysis of the different groups of DE genes , using InnateDB analysis , is shown in Table 2 and described in the text . 
( Figure 2 ; Table 2 ) . 
Late convalescent patients , at 3 -- 5 months , had gene expression patterns that were nearly identical to those 
Transcriptional Response Attributable to `` Other '' Invasive Bacterial Infections . 
In this study , we also proﬁled the host response in 6 cases of `` other '' bacterial infections in febrile HIV-infected patients ( 3 E. coli , 3 S. pneumoniae ) who presented consecutively alongside iNTS cases . 
The global expression pro-ﬁles of these patients , based on similarities across all groups , showed that iNTS and other bacterial infections clustered together , to the exclusion of controls , and that `` other '' infections formed a subcluster ( Figure 1 ) ; InnateDB GO and pathway analyses of DE genes in these other bacterial infections , compared with HIV-positive controls , revealed a transcriptional proﬁle that was indicative of a pronounced inﬂammatory / immune response , in sharp contrast to observations described above for iNTS patients . 
GO terms that were statistically signiﬁcantly overrepresented among upregulated DE genes in `` other '' bacterial infections included `` immune response '' ( 51 genes ) and `` inﬂammatory response '' ( 24 genes ) . 
Pathway analysis demonstrated that the 
IL-1 and IL-4 pathways were overrepresented , with IL1R1 , IL1R2 , and IL1RN upregulated 5 - , 10 - and 3-fold , respectively . 
Complement and coagulation , and the atypical NFjB pathway were also statistically overrepresented ( Table 2 ) . 
Network analysis identiﬁed that the top hub nodes were all different from those seen during iNTS disease , and included SRC ( a tyrosine kinase ) , AKT1 ( a protein kinase ) , and HSP90AA1 
( a heat shock protein ) , all of which are involved in regulation of inﬂammatory responses . 
These `` other '' acute bacterial infections during HIV therefore caused a marked stereotypical and well-coordinated immune and inﬂammatory transcriptional pattern that was lacking during iNTS infection . 
The contrast of the host response in iNTS compared with `` other '' infections is supported by proinﬂammatory cytokine protein levels measured from consecutive patients with iNTS and invasive S pneumoniae disease ( Figure 3 ) , recruited using the same protocols as for this study as described [ 6 ] . 
Transcriptional Response Attributable to Underlying HIV Infection . 
HIV-positive controls were also compared with 
HIV-negative controls to conﬁrm that the expression proﬁles in HIV-positive controls were representative of known gene expression proﬁles [ 28 ] . 
There were 374 DE genes attributable to underlying HIV disease , and the GO terms `` response to virus '' , 
`` immune response , '' `` innate immune response , '' and `` inﬂammatory response '' were signiﬁcant among upregulated DE genes . 
Forty-three percent of upregulated genes were IFN-inducible . 
The `` RIG-I -- like receptor signaling pathway '' and 
`` cytosolic DNA sensing pathway '' were upregulated , both of which are involved in the detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids . 
Network analysis of DE genes and their interacting partners identiﬁed a signiﬁcant subnetwork involving the STAT1 and IRF7 transcription factors and many of the IFN-inducible genes , conﬁrming the known central importance of IFN responses during HIV infection . 
These same underlying

The Transcriptional mRNA Response During Ex Vivo Stimulation of Whole Blood
Whole blood from 3 subject groups , HIV-infected convalescent iNTS cases ( n 5 6 ) , HIV-positive controls ( n 5 9 ) , and HIV-negative controls ( n 5 11 ) , were stimulated with either LPS or ﬂagellin , or mock stimulated with PBS , to assess whether iNTS convalescent cases were capable of mounting a TLR-driven transcriptional response . 
On hierarchical clustering analysis , samples grouped strongly into stimulated and mock-stimulated clusters ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . 
For both stimuli , the majority of DE genes were in common between at least 2 subject groups , suggesting a common response for all subject groups ( Figure 4 ) . 
There was a greater magnitude of overall response , as measured by numbers of DE genes , for LPS compared with ﬂagellin stimulation of blood cells . 
GO and pathway analysis 
( Supplementary Table 1 ) conﬁrmed that ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with either LPS or ﬂagellin elicited a strong common inﬂammatory response pattern . 
Immune-related pathways such as the IKK-NFjB cascade , IL-1 pathway and the inﬂammasome , TNF pathway , apoptosis and TLR signaling were statistically overrepresented in all 3 subject groups for both stimuli compared with mock stimulation with PBS . 
Molecular interaction network analysis showed that for both stimulants , and in all subject groups , the 10 top hub ( highly connected ) nodes were the samedIKBKE , NFKB1 , NFKB2 , 
RELA , SRC , TRAF1 , TRAF2 , NFKBAI , MAPK1 , and SMAD3dall of which are involved in signal transduction during immune responses , particularly through the NFjB pathway . 
This conﬁrms that PBMC from convalescent iNTS cases were capable of mounting a highly stereotypical NFjB-mediated response , in keeping with the transcriptional responses reported in published studies [ 9 -- 11 ] . 
This is in sharp contrast to our observation that the same patients did not mount such responses during iNTS disease , indicating that other factors , perhaps endotoxin tolerance-like responses [ 29 ] , caused suppression or

attenuation of typical immune responses . 
DISCUSSION
In the present study , we used microarray analysis to describe the differential transcription of mRNA expression associated with iNTS in adults with HIV infection . 
It is remarkable that in the context of this life-threatening bloodstream infection , there was no evidence of a coordinated immune and proinﬂammatory response over and above the background transcriptional perturbations associated with underlying HIV . 
Speciﬁcally , there was an underrepresentation of the TLR-signaling and NFjB pathways that are prominent in previously reported studies of transcription during Salmonella infection , including the interactions of Salmonella with epithelial cells and macrophages in vitro [ 9 , 10 ] , in an infection model exploiting zebraﬁsh [ 11 ] , and in human invasive typhoid fever caused by S. Typhi in HIV-uninfected patients [ 12 ] . 
In addition , while network hub proteins following ex vivo stimulation were dominated by multiple components of the NFjB pathway , during iNTS disease itself , the NFjB inhibitor IjBb was an upregulated hub protein , and several other negative regulators of innate immunity were also upregulated . 
Although IFNc mRNA was modestly upregulated during iNTS , there was a notable lack of measurable downstream effects on IFNc-inducible genes . 
This is consistent with our previous observations during intracellular NTS infection of ex vivo primary macrophages from HIV-infected subjects , in which we found that the marked decline of cytokine responses in late HIV was not corrected by ex vivo priming with IFNc [ 7 ] . 
An intrinsic host defect associated with HIV infection is , however , unlikely to fully explain these differences . 
In contrast to patients with iNTS , other bacterial bloodstream infections in HIV-infected adults caused a prototypical proinﬂammatory transcriptional response , which showed only 24 % overlap with iNTS among differentially expressed genes . 
In addition , j convalescent iNTS cases were able to mount NF B responses comparable in magnitude and pattern to control groups following ex vivo stimulation with LPS or ﬂagellin , suggesting that their capacity to respond to inﬂammatory stimuli was not simply `` exhausted '' by underlying HIV disease . 
HIV infection is thought to dysregulate the NFjB pathway , which may be `` hijacked '' to activate HIV transcription [ 30 ] . 
Noursadeghi et al. [ 31 ] have demonstrated that HIV infection of macrophages may selectively attenuate elements of the NFjB cascade without compromising overall immune or inﬂammatory responses . 
Endotoxin tolerance responses have also been associated with many clinical syndromes , including sepsis [ 29 ] . 
We hypothesize that the effects of late HIV and iNTS coinfection may speciﬁcally interact to result in a more profound attenuation and unique lack of coordinated gene expression in NFjB-related proinﬂammatory and immune pathways . 
We also found that iNTS infection in HIV-infected individuals enhanced the transcription of genes related to the cell cycle , including some known to speciﬁcally interact with HIV proteins [ 17 -- 19 ] . 
Other upregulated pathways were associated with viral replication and cellular repair . 
This contrasts with our previous observations that cell cycle regulator genes are downregulated during in vitro Salmonella infection of macrophages in the absence of HIV [ 10 ] . 
Cell cycle dysregulation , with unbalanced proliferation and apoptosis of T cells during HIV infection , is a recognized contributor to 
HIV immunopathology [ 17 ] , and antagonism of MDM2 has been explored as a therapeutic tool in HIV [ 27 , 32 ] . 
Intracellular S. Typhimurium have been shown to reactivate latent HIV infection in chronically infected cells [ 33 , 34 ] . 
We therefore postulate that the interaction between iNTS and HIV contributes to worsened HIV-related cell cycle dysfunction and possibly to heightened HIV viral replication . 
The persistence of this signature into convalescence may therefore compromise effective immune reconstitution once antiretroviral drugs are commenced after an episode of iNTS . 
The use of whole blood is important because of its accessibility and potential for future diagnostics , but it is not possible to comment on the relative contribution of different cell types or tissues to the observed transcriptional proﬁle . 
The characteristic transcriptional patterns we observed may provide useful bio-markers for diagnosis . 
The apparent unique interaction between 
HIV and NTS , both intracellular pathogens , therefore merits further clinical study to determine the impact of iNTS on the course of HIV disease , and further ex vivo study to understand the cellular basis and molecular mechanisms of these observations and to identify potential therapeutic targets for this neglected human disease .
