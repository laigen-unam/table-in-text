Abstract 
Background : The Ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) is a transcriptional regulator that controls iron homeostasis in bacteria . 
Although the regulatory role of Fur in Escherichia coli is well characterized , most of the studies were conducted under routine culture conditions , i.e. , in ambient oxygen concentration . 
To reveal potentially novel aspects of the Fur regulon in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium under oxygen conditions similar to that encountered in the host , we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type strain ( ATCC 14028s ) and its isogenic Δfur strain under anaerobic conditions . 
Results : Microarray analysis of anaerobically grown Δfur S. Typhimurium identified 298 differentially expressed genes . 
Expression of several genes controlled by Fnr and NsrR appeared to be also dependent on Fur . 
Furthermore , Fur was required for the activity of the cytoplasmic superoxide disumutases ( MnSOD and FeSOD ) . 
The regulation of FeSOD gene , sodB , occurred via small RNAs ( i.e. , the ryhB homologs , rfrA and rfrB ) with the aid of the RNA chaperone Hfq . 
The transcription of sodA was increased in Δfur ; however , the enzyme was inactive due to the incorporation of iron instead of manganese in SodA . 
Additionally , in Δfur , the expression of the gene coding for the ferritin-like protein ( ftnB ) was down-regulated , while the transcription of the gene coding for the nitric oxide ( NO · ) detoxifying flavohemoglobin ( hmpA ) was up-regulated . 
The promoters of ftnB and hmpA do not contain recognized Fur binding motifs , which indicated their probable indirect regulation by Fur . 
However , Fur activation of ftnB was independent of Fnr . 
In addition , the expression of the gene coding for the histone-like protein , H-NS ( hns ) was increased in Δfur . 
This may explain the observed down-regulation of the tdc operon , responsible for the anaerobic degradation of threonine , and ftnB in Δfur . 
Conclusions : This study determined that Fur is a positive factor in ftnB regulation , while serving to repress the expression of hmpA . 
Furthermore , Fur is required for the proper expression and activation of the antioxidant enzymes , FeSOD and MnSOD . 
Finally , this work identified twenty-six new targets of Fur regulation , and demonstrates that H-NS repressed genes are down-regulated in Δfur . 
Background
The Ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) is a metal-dependent regulator of transcription and post-transcription in bacteria , which senses metal concentration and/or the redox state of the cells ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . 
The classical model of the regulatory role of Fur depicts transcriptional repression through ferrous iron that results in Fur-Fe2 + binding to the operator site of a target gene 
[ 2,3 ] . 
Fur-Fe2 + binding to DNA are presumed to be homodimeric ; however , multimeric complexes have been reported [ 4,5 ] . 
In addition , the metal cofactor pre-sent in vivo is controversial , due to the ability of the Fur protein to bind different divalent cations , in vitro [ 6 ] . 
For example , Fur represses aerobactin biosynthesis using ferrous iron , cobalt , or manganese [ 2 ] . 
Moreover , most researchers studying Fur binding to promoter sequences , in vitro , employ manganese instead of ferrous iron due to the reactivity of ferrous iron with oxygen . 
However , evidence exists that Fur regulates specific genes differently in the presence of ferrous iron or manganese [ 7 ] .

Fur also contains zinc for protein stability [ 8,9 ] . 
This indicates that the availability of the metal cofactor to pathogens residing in the host dictates the activity of Fur . 
The regulatory role of Fur has been demonstrated in numerous pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms growing in the presence of ambient oxygen [ 10-19 ] . 
However , research has shown that the oxygen concentration in the host is low . 
For example , the oxygen sensitive [ 20 ] , Fnr ( Fumarate nitrate reduction ) was shown to be essential for virulence in Salmonella enterica sero-var Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) [ 21 ] , Shigella flexnari [ 22 ] , Neisseria meningitidis [ 23 ] , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 24 ] . 
In addition , the expression of the dimeric Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase ( SodCI ) , one of the virulence determinants in S. Typhimurium , within the J774 .1 cell line was shown to be Fnr-dependent [ 25 ] . 
Fnr is a transcriptional regulator that is active as a homodimer and contains an oxygen labile iron sulfur cluster ( 4Fe-4S ) [ 26 ] . 
Fnr can serve either as an activator or as a repressor of transcription , depending on the target gene . 
For instance , under anaerobic conditions , Fnr represses the cytochrome c oxidase ( cyoABCDE ) and the cytochrome bd complex ( cydAB ) , while activating genes important for utilizing alternative electron acceptors such as fumarate [ 21 ] . 
Therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that O2 concentration within the host is low enough to activate Fnr in S. Typhimurium residing within cells of the innate immune system . 
This in vivo low oxygen concentration appears to be sufficient to cause a shift in the redox state of iron from ferric to ferrous . 
Indeed , when S. Typhimurium is within macro-phages , repression of the Fur regulated iroBCDE promoter occurs regardless of the presence of the host metal transporter Nramp1 [ 27,28 ] . 
This demonstrates that during intracellular growth of S. Typhimurium , the state of oxygen tension and iron valence are adequate for the activation of both Fnr and Fur , respectively . 
Recently , we demonstrated the role of Fur in HilA expression and virulence in S. Typhimurium , which is mediated by the negative regulation of H-NS by Fur under anaerobic conditions [ 29 ] . 
H-NS is a DNA binding protein that is associated with the nucleoid of Gram-negative enteric bacteria ( reviewed in [ 30 ] ) . 
Deletion of hns is considered lethal unless an additional mutation occurs in either the alternative sigma factor , rpoS , or the transcription factor , phoP [ 31 ] . 
H-NS binding can alter the topology of DNA and influence gene regulation [ 32 ] . 
Typically , H-NS exhibits a repressive role in gene regulation , especially of genetic loci associated with virulence [ 31,33-35 ] . 
H-NS preferentially binds to AT rich segments of DNA , which are characteristic of horizontally acquired Salmonella patho-genicity islands ( SPIs ) [ 36 ] . 
Interestingly , H-NS also represses genes associated with anaerobic metabolism including those responsible for the degradation of L-threonine , encoded by the tdc operon , and are induced under anaerobic conditions [ 37 ] . 
H-NS binds the tdc locus and represses its transcription [ 31 ] , thereby linking amino acid catabolism with H-NS regulation . 
In addition , Fur is known to activate SPI1 via the activation of the positive regulators of SPI1 ( i.e. , HilA and HilD ) [ 38,39 ] . 
This activation is , in part , indirect where Fur represses the expression of hns , which represses the expression of hilA and hilD [ 29 ] . 
Thus , Fur indirectly activates SPI1 via its repression of hns , demonstrating that iron metabolism can influence genes regulated by H-NS . 
Our goal here was to compare the transcriptome of wild-type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium to an isogenic strain lacking the fur gene ( Δfur ) in cells growing under anae-robic conditions ( i.e. , conditions resembling that encountered by the pathogen during infection [ 40 ] ) . 
To accomplish that goal , we used DNA microarray analysis and operon reporter fusions . 
We found that Fur directly or indirectly regulates 298 genes ( ~ 6.5 % of the genome ) ; of these , 49 contained a putative Fur binding site . 
Interestingly , Fnr controls 15 of these 49 genes [ 21 ] and 12 of the 15 genes contain putative binding sites for both Fur and Fnr . 
This suggests a regulatory link between oxygen and iron availability through the action of these two global regulators , Fur and Fnr . 
Furthermore , Fur was required for the activity of both cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases ( MnSOD and FeSOD ) . 
We also found that the anaerobic expression of ftnB ( encoding a ferri-tin-like protein ) and hmpA ( encoding the NO · detoxifying flavohemoglobin ) was dependent on both Fur and Fnr . 
However , the promoters of ftnB and hmpA do not contain recognizable Fur binding motifs indicating their indirect regulation by Fur . 
Increased expression of H-NS , a known repressor of ftnB , tdc operon , and other genes , in Δfur may account for their activation by Fur . 
Finally , we have also identified twenty-six genes as new targets of Fur regulation in S. Typhimurium . 
Methods
Bacterial strains , plasmids , growth conditions , and reagents S. Typhimurium ( ATCC 14028s ) was used throughout this study , and for the constructing gene knockouts . 
Bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1 . 
Primers used were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) and are listed ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . 
All knockouts were constructed using l Red mediated methodologies in the host strain carrying pKD46 . 
The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium to an optical density ( OD600 ) of 0.3 at which point 50 m arabinose was added for 90 min [ 41 ] . 
The culture was centrifuged , electroporated with 1 μg of purified PCR product of the gene of interest , recovered in SOC media ( 20 g tryptone , 5 g yeast extract , 0.5 g NaCl , per liter plus 20 mM glucose ) for 3 h , plated on LB agar with the appropriate antibiotic , and incubated at 37 °C . 
Transformants were verified by PCR followed by DNA sequencing . 
P22 phage transduction was used to move the mutations into the specified genetic backgrounds of S. Typhimurium 14028s . 
Colony PCR was used to confirm the genotype ( s ) . 
Transductants were purified on Evans-Blue-Uranine ( EBU ) agar plates . 
The medium used throughout this study was a buf-fered ( pH = 7.4 ) LB containing 100 mM MOPS and 20 mM xylose ( LB-MOPS-X ) [ 21,29,42,43 ] ; where indicated , kanamycin and ampicillin were used at 55 μg ml-1 and 100 μg ml-1 , respectively . 
Anaerobic conditions were maintained in a Coy anaerobic chamber ( Coy Laboratory Products , Grass Lake , MI ) filled with anaerobic gas mixture ( 10 % H2 , 5 % CO2 , and 85 % N2 ) . 
Media were equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber for at least 48 h prior to use . 
Aerobic conditions were maintained by shaking at 200 RPM at 37 °C in a New Brunswick gyratory water bath . 
Growth was determined by measuring changes in OD600 over time . 
The ferrous iron chelator , 2 , 2 ' dipyridyl ( dip ) , was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( St. Louis , MO ) and used at 200 μM . 
PCR reagents were from Promega ( Madison , WI ) . 
RNA isolation
For the microarray experiments , independent anaerobic cultures of 14028s and Δfur ( KLM001 ) were used to inoculate three independent flasks ( 150 ml of anoxic LB-MOPS-X ) for each strain . 
The three independent cultures of 14028s and Δfur were grown to an OD600 of 0.30 to 0.35 ( ~ four generations ) and treated with RNA-later ( Qiagen ) to fix the cells and preserve the quality of the RNA as described previously [ 21,43 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted and its quality was assured before aliquots of the RNA samples were stored at -80 °C for use in the microarray as previously described [ 21,43 ] . 
Microarray studies
Serovar Typhimurium microarray slides were prepared and used as previously described [ 21,43,44 ] . 
The SuperScript Indirect cDNA labeling system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was used to synthesize the cDNA for the hybridizations . 
Each experiment consisted of two hybri-dizations , on two slides carried-out at 42 °C overnight . 
Dye swapping was performed to avoid dye-associated effects on cDNA synthesis . 
The slides were washed at increasing stringencies and the microarrays were scanned for the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent signals with a ScanArray 4000 microarray scanner from GSI Lumonics ( Watertown , MA ) . 
The intensity of each spot was expressed as the sum of the intensities of the pixels included in a circle positioned over the spot . 
Th background was the sum of the intensities of an identical number of pixels surrounding the circled spot .

Data analysis
Values of Cy3 and Cy5 for each spot were normalized over the total intensity for each dye to account for differences in total intensity between the scanned images . 
The data from the microarray analysis were evaluated by two methods as previously described [ 21,43 ] . 
Briefly , the data were evaluated by a pair-wise comparison , calculated with a two-tailed Student 's t test and analyzed by the MEAN and TTEST procedures of SAS-STAT statistical software ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) the degrees of freedom for the t test were calculated as described previously [ 21,43 ] . 
The t statistic was performed using the , two-tailed , heteroscedastic TTEST function of Excel software ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA ) . 
The signal intensity at each spot from Δfur and the WT was analyzed and used to calculate median expression ratios and standard deviations for ORFs showing at least 2.5-fold change and p < 0.05 [ 21,43 ] . 
Microarray data
The microarray data are accessible via GEO accession number GSE18441 at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ query/acc.cgi ? 
acc = GSE18441 . 
Logo graph and promoter analysis
The information matrix for the generation of the Fur logo was produced using the alignment of the Escheri-chia coli Fur binding sequences , available at http://arep . 
med.harvard.edu/ecoli_matrices/ . 
To account for slight variation in nucleotide usage between E. coli and Salmo-nella , a second alignment for S. Typhimurium was built using the 5 ' regions of the homologous genes used to build the E. coli information matrix . 
The new alignment was used to generate an information matrix specific for S. Typhimurium . 
A graphical representation of the matrix through a logo graph was obtained with Weblogo software ( version 2.8.1 , 18 October 2004 ) , available at http://weblogo.berkeley.edu . 
The information matrix was used to scan the 5 ' region ( from the position -400 to +50 ) of the genes with significant variations of transcripts using the Patser software ( version 3d ) , available at http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/ . 
If a sequence corresponding to a Fur binding motif was identified , then this sequence was given a weighted score [ 45 ] . 
Construction of transcriptional lacZ fusions
Single-copy genomic transcriptional lacZ fusions were constructed as described previously [ 46 ] . 
Briefly , 300 ng of pCP20 was transformed into mutant strains ; cultures were transferred twice at 30 °C , and checked for loss of the antibiotic marker . 
Plasmids with a single FRT site upstream of promoterless lacZY were transformed into mutant strains carrying pCP20 and incubated at 37 °C on an LB-agar plate with kanamycin . 
Transformants were transferred three times at 40 °C , verified by PCR , and transduced into appropriate background ( s ) . 
b-galactosidase assay and `` Differential Plot '' presentation of the data The b-galactosidase assay was used to assess expression of transcriptional fusions in cultures growing at steady state . 
This was accomplished by 50-fold dilution of anaerobically grown overnight ( ~ 17 hr ) cultures into fresh medium and once a steady state of growth was established , the cells were re-inoculated into fresh LB-MOPS-X medium to an OD600 ~ 0.02 . 
b-galactosidase assays were conducted during growth and the activity ( U/ml ) [ 47 ] was plotted against changes in OD600 in the form of a differential plot [ 48,49 ] ; which are usually recommended for determining the rate of synthesis of an mRNA or a protein relative to the total rate of synth-esis in the cell . 
The slope of the linear regression of this type of plot represents the differential rate of synthesis ( i.e. , Specific Activity , Units/OD600 ) during the steady state of growth . 
The intrinsic advantages of using this method ( i.e. , differential rate ) over the commonly used method ( i.e. , one-time point assays ) are well documen-ted [ 50-53 ] . 
Data shown were from three independent cultures with standard deviation . 
Preparation of cell-free extracts and SOD activity gels Cultures were grown anaerobically overnight , diluted to ~ 0.02 OD600 in LB-MOPS-X , and cells were harvested at OD600 ~ 0.25 . 
Further cell growth and de novo protein synthesis were minimized by adding chloramphenicol ( 50 μg ml-1 ) and ice to the cultures . 
In addition , 50 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol was included at each step of sample preparation and handling . 
The cultures were sealed anaerobically and the cells collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g at 4 °C . 
Cells were washed with phosphate buffer ( pH 7.8 , 50 mM potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mM EDTA , KPi ) , centrifuged again , and resuspended in the same buffer . 
Cells were sonicated on ice for 15 sec on and 30 sec off for 15 min of total sonication time . 
Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C , and the supernatant was dialyzed against KPi in dialysis membranes with an 8,000 molecular weight cut-off . 
Dialyzed cell-free extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 ° C , and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use . 
Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method [ 54 ] . 
Superoxide dismutase activity gels were performed using native 10 % acrylamide gels as described previously [ 55 ] 
Fumarate reductase activity ( FRD ) was assayed from cell-free extracts as described previously [ 56 ] . 
Briefly , cells were grown , cell-free extracts were prepared as described above , and the fumarate dependent oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen was determined . 
Specific activity of FRD is expressed as μmole of reduced benzyl viologen oxidized per minute per milligram of total protein . 
Measurements of total [Mn]
Independent anaerobic cultures were diluted to OD600 ~ 0.02 and grown until OD600 0.35 in a Coy anaerobic chamber . 
Chloramphenicol was added at 50 μg ml-1 , samples were sealed anaerobically , and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C . 
Samples were washed with KPi as above , centrifuged , and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer . 
Samples were dried and treated with 3 M nitric acid overnight at room temperature then quickly boiled . 
Total manganese content was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectro-metry ( ICP-OES ) at North Carolina State University Analytical Service Laboratory . 
Total manganese and iron was measured in LB medium as above using a 5X concentration of medium . 
Results
Growth of Δfur under anaerobic and aerobic conditions Iron is an essential element for redox reactions in biology . 
However , it is an important factor in oxygen toxicity due to its involvement in hydroxyl radicals ( HO · ) formation via Fenton chemistry [ 57 ] . 
Therefore , we compared the effects of a deletion of fur on growth kinetics under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions . 
Data in Figure 1 demonstrate that Δfur was not compromised in its growth kinetics under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions . 
Effect of Fur on the anaerobic transcriptome of S. Typhimurium Under anaerobic conditions , the absence of fur resulted in the differential expression of 298 genes ( Additional File 2 : Table S2 ) . 
These genes were organized by Cluster of Orthologous Groups ( COGs ) and the numbers of genes within each COG are shown in Table 2 . 
The absence of fur resulted in increased expression ( i.e. , Fur acted as a repressor ) of 226 genes . 
However , the absence of Fur resulted in decreased expression ( i.e. , Fur acted as an activator ) of 72 genes , most likely via an indirect mechanism . 
A Fur information matrix , specific for S. Typhimurium , was generated ( Figure 2 ) , and used to scan the upstream regions of the 298 genes identified as differentially expressed in response to deletion of fur . 
We identified 49 genes that contain a putative Fur binding site ( Table 3 - columns 1 & 2 and Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
a. Fur as a repressor Genes associated with metal homeostasis were up-regu-lated in Δfur . 
These included the well characterized genes/operons involved in iron homeostasis ( i.e. , entA-BEC , iroBCDE , iroN , fes , tonB , fepA , bfr , bfd ) , Mn2 + transport genes ( i.e. , sitABC ) , and copper resistance ( i.e. , cutC ) [ 58-65 ] ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Expressions of genes involved in xylose metabolism ( xylBR ) were increased 3.7 and 2.9-fold , respectively , in Δfur relative to the WT ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
In addition , the glycolytic genes pfkA and gpmA were 3.3-and 5.6-fold higher in Δfur , respectively ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Two genes , STM1586 ( coding for a putative periplasmic protein ) and sitA were up-regulated 76.1 and 53.8-fold , respectively , in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
These two genes exhibited the highest differential expression in Δfur . 
Intriguingly , the microarray data showed that the gene for adenloysuccinate synthe-tase ( purA ) , which is required for adenosine 5 ' mono-phosphate synthesis , was up-regulated 3.5-fold in Δfur . 
Incidentally , purA mutants are known to be highly atte-nuated and have been used in developing in vivo expression technology ( IVET ) to detect promoters activated during S. Typhimurium infection [ 66,67 ] . 
Transcription of the cytochrome-o ubiquinol oxidase operon ( cyoABCDE ) and the high affinity cytochrome-d terminal oxidase genes ( cydAB ) was repressed by Fur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Interestingly , aerobic expression of cydAB is repressed by H-NS , which is relieved by the response regulator ArcA [ 68 ] . 
In addition , we detected increased expression of hns in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) , and earlier work detected in vivo binding of Fur to the upstream region of hns [ 29 ] ; this strongly indicates that Fur directly represses hns under anaerobic conditions . 
How or if H-NS may interact in the anaerobic regulation of cydAB under ou

Categorized According to Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs) a Genes with increased expression in the absence of fur b Genes with decreased expression in the absence of fur
conditions is unknown , since the repression of cydAB by H-NS does not appear to occur under anaerobic conditions [ 68 ] . 
Genes associated with DNA repair and purine meta-bolism ( nrdAB , nth , recA , and nei ) were repressed by Fur under anaerobic conditions ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) , thus implicating Fur as a regulator of DNA repair and de novo synthesis . 
Fur was found to repress ydiE ( STM1346 ) and a putative Fur binding site was found upstream of the start codon , where the expression of the gene was 7.4-fold higher in the mutant than in the wild-type ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
In Yersinia enter-ocolitica , YdiE has a conserved HemP ( COG4256 ) domain , and is encoded within the hemin uptake operon [ 69 ] . 
Although S. Typhimurium is not known to utilize host 's heme , previous work has established a Fur binding site upstream of ydiE and hemP in S. Typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica , respectively [ 16,69 ] . 
This indicates that our bioinformatic analyses indeed agree with experimentally identified Fur binding sites . 
b. Fur as an activator Anaerobic transcription of the fumarate reductase ( frdABD ) operon and the aspartase gene ( aspA ) was significantly lower in Δfur ( i.e. , Fur is serving as an activator ) ; however , the genes coding for the alpha and beta subunits of succinyl-CoA synthetase ( sucCD ) were upregulated 4.1 and 2.7-fold , respectively ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
These genes ( i.e. , frdABD , aspA , sucCD ) and fumAB ( fumarate hydratase ) are members of th reductive branch of the TCA cycle . 
We assayed for fumarate reductase ( FRD ) in cell-free extracts from anaerobic cultures and found that Fur is required for the anaerobic transcription and activity of FRD in S. Typhimurium ( Additional file 3 : Table S3 ) . 
In E. coli , the transport of C4-dicarboxylates occurs via two see-mingly redundant genes encoded by dcuA and dcuB [ 70 ] . 
In the present study , the dcuB-fumB operon was unaffected by Fur , while the aspA-dcuA operon was significantly down regulated in Δfur and both genes contained a putative Fur box 5 ' of the start codon ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Genes involved in anaerobic respiration ( dmsABC ) and ethanolamine utilization ( eutSPQTDMEJGHABCLK ) were activated by Fur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
The mechanism for reduced expression of dmsABC is unclear . 
Ethanolamine is a significant source of carbon and nitrogen during Salmonella infection [ 71 ] . 
One metabolic pathway that appears impacted by Fur is that required for glycerol metabolism . 
The genes for glycerol metabolism are located throughout the genome . 
Figure 2 Logo graph of the information matrix from the 
alignment of Fur-regulated genes in S. Typhimurium . 
The height of each column of characters represents information , measured in bits , for that specific position and the height of each individual character represents the frequency of each nucleotide . 
For instance , glpQT and glpABC are divergently transcribed in two predicted operons . 
All of these genes were significantly down regulated in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Furthermore , glpD , and glpKF were all down regulated in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
The down-regulation of these genes suggests that the Δfur strain may be unable to utilize glycerol or transport glycerol - 3 phosphate . 
The mechanism of this regulation is unclear , but the absence of Fur binding sites in the promoters of any of these genes suggests an indirect mode of regulation . 
The contribution of glycerol meta-bolism to infection is unknown . 
Another metabolic pathway , the tdc operon ( required for the anaerobic transport and metabolism of L-threo-nine and L-serine [ 72,73 ] ) was activated by Fur . 
The genes in this operon ( tdcBCDEG ) are activated by tdcA [ 74 ] . 
TdcA is a member of the LysR family of transcriptional activators [ 75 ] . 
Our data showed that the expression of all genes in this operon , tdcABCDEG , was significantly down-regulated in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
However , a Fur binding site was no identified in the promoters of any of the genes in the tdc operon , suggesting its indirect regulation by Fur . 
Importantly , H-NS is known to directly bind and repress this operon [ 31,76 ] . 
Therefore , the increased expression of hns in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) , may account for the observed effect of Fur on the tdc operon . 
Mutations in the tdc operon have been shown to reduce invasion and virulence in S. Typhimurium [ 77,78 ] . 
In addition to the reduced expression of the eut operon , the reduced expression of the tdc operon and hilA may contribute to the observed attenuation of the Δfur strain of S. Typhimurium [ 29,79 ] .

Role of Fur in regulation of antioxidant genes Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( ROS and RNS , respectively ) are important host defense responses during bacterial infection . 
Our array data ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) revealed differential regulation of some important antioxidant genes whose products are essential for protecting the cells against ROS and RNS ( i.e. , superoxide dismutases , ferritin-like protein , and flavohemoglo-bin ) . 
Therefore , we decided to study the expression of these genes in greater detail . 
a. Regulation of sodA and sodB There is plethora of information about the regulation of sodA and sodB in E. coli [ 80-85 ] , but there is little knowledge about the regulation of these genes in S. Typhimurium [ 86 ] . 
In the present study , the microarray data showed that the anaerobic expression of sodA and sodB in Δfur was > 9-fold higher and > 3-fold lower , respectively , than in the parent WT strain ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
SodA ( MnSOD ) and SodB ( FeSOD ) are the cytosolic superoxide dismutases of S. Typhimurium and they require the cofactors manganese and iron , respectively . 
These SODs are homodimers , and are fully functional when metalated with the appropriate metals 
( i.e. , manganese for SodA and iron for SodB ) . 
However , a heterodimer consisting of SodA ( Mn ) / SodB ( Fe ) can still exhibit SOD activity , albeit at a reduced level compared to the homodimer [ 87 ] . 
Thus , in order to see an active hybrid SOD , both SodA and SodB must be expressed . 
Data in Figure 3A demonstrated that , as in anaerobic E. coli , the WT strain ( Lane 1 ) lacked the activity of both Mn - and Hybrid-SODs , but possessed an active FeSOD . 
However , Δfur ( Figure 3A - Lane 2 ) was devoid of all three SOD-isozymes . 
The lack of FeSOD in Δfur was of no surprise , as previous studies in E. coli [ 83,84 ] have established that Fur is indirectly required for the translation of sodB via its repression of the small RNA , ryhB , which works in conjunction with the RNA chaperon protein , Hfq [ 88,89 ] . 
Indeed , a strain harboring deletions in both Fur and Hfq ( ΔfurΔhfq ) resulted in restoration of SodB activity ( Figure 3A-Lane 4 ) . 
Furthermore , the high degree of sequence identity in the promoter and the gene sequence of ryhB of E. coli with the two ryhB-like small RNAs , rfrA and rfr of S. Typhimurium [ 39 ] , suggested that the regulation of sodB in S. Typhimurium is similar to that reported in E. coli [ 88,89 ] . 
Interestingly , expression of the hybrid SOD appears up-regulated in Δhfq and ΔfurΔhfq ( Figure 3A-Lane 3 and 4 ) . 
The reason for this is unclear , but may be due to the activation of the Hfq-binding small RNA ( fnrS ) by Fnr , which subsequently represses the expression of sodA [ 90,91 ] . 
The WT strain of S. Typhimurium possessed neither an active SodA ( MnSOD ) nor the hybrid enzyme ( SodA/SodB ) , which is not surprising since this is normally the case in WT E. coli [ 92 ] . 
What was surprising is the lack of MnSOD activity in the anaerobic cell-free extracts from Δfur ( Figure 3A - Lane 2 ) in spite of the > 9-fold increase in the transcription of sodA ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Therefore , we reasoned that the increased intracellular concentration of free iron in Δfur [ 93 ] could result in competition of iron with manganese for the active site of SodA . 
This would lead to the formation of a non-active form of the enzyme , i.e. , SodA-Fe instead of the active SodA-Mn ( MnSOD ) . 
Analysis of total iron and manganese concentrations in our media showed that it contained ~ 40-fold more iron than manganese ( i.e. , ~ 7.5 μM iron vs. ~ 0.2 μM manganese ) . 
Additionally , the manganese content of anaerobic cultures of the parent strain and of the Δfur strain were low , 0.09 ± 0.01 and 0.08 ± 0.04 μmoles manganese per gram of dry weight , respectively . 
Therefore , we supplemented the growth media with 1 mM MnCl2 and determined the SOD activities ( Figure 3B ) . 
If our reasoning was correct , we expected that excess Mn2 + added to the growth media would reveal increased MnSOD activity in Δfur . 
Indeed , this was the case , as a dramatic increase in MnSOD was observed in Δfur , but not in the parent strain ( Figure 3B - lanes 1 vs. 4 ) . 
Also , cultures grown in presence of 1 mM MnCl2 contained 47.2 ± 2.7 and 48.8 ± 2.0 μmoles of manganese per gram of dry weight for the parent strain and for Δfur , respectively . 
Altered MnSOD activity in Δfur was due entirely to the lack of a functional fur gene since the introduction of a plasmid carrying the fur gene ( i.e. , pfur-ha ) diminished MnSOD activity to that of the parent strain ( Figure 3B - Lane 1 and 6 ) . 
In addition , the plasmid pfur-ha restored FeSOD activity ( Figure 3A - lane 5 ) as well as the phenotypic appearance of the WT strain observed on a Tris buffered chrome azurol agar plates ( CAS plates ) [ 94 ] containing 0.3 % xylose [ 29 ] . 
These results indicated that increased transcription of sodA in Δfur did not result in a corresponding increased MnSOD activity due to the excess intracellular free iron and that the addition of Mn2 + negated this effect . 
On the other hand , the inclusion of excess Mn2 + in the growth medium of the parent strain did not increase MnSOD activity , which indicated that Mn2 + was not a signal for sodA induction . 
Furthermore , these findings demonstrated an important aspect of metalloenzyme regulation , i.e. , the availability of the correct cofactor has a profound impact on enzyme activity . 
b. Regulation of ftnB Microarray data ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) revealed a 7-fold reduction in the expression of ftnB in Δfur as compared to the parent strain . 
The expression of ftnB was shown to be activated by Fnr [ 21 ] . 
Therefore , we used a chromosomal ftnB-lacZ transcriptional fusion in Δfur and in Δfnr genetic backgrounds to determine the contribution of each regulator in the expression of ftnB . 
The deletion of fur reduced the aerobic rate of synthesis of the reporter gene by > 2-fold compared to the parent strain ( Figure 4A ) . 
2 , 2 ' dipyridyl ( dip ) reduced the rate of synthesis of the reporter gene in aerobic conditions ( Figure 4A ) . 
Although induction of the reporter fusion occurred earlier in the growth phase with dip treated cultures , the rate of synthesis was reduced compared to untreated parent strain . 
This indicates inhibition by dip

5 shows that the WT exhibited very little expression of hmpA-lacZ under anaerobic conditions ( Figure 5A ) ; suggesting regulation may be oxygen dependent . 
Indeed , expression was ~ 14-fold higher under aerobic conditions than anaerobic conditions ( B. Troxell and H.M. Hassan , unpublished data ) . 
However , the addition of the iron chelator , dip , resulted in an increased rate of synthesis ~ 81-fold ( Figure 5A ) . 
The increased expression of hmpA-lacZ by the addition of dip could have been due to inactivation of Fnr , Fur , and/or NsrR . 
We narrowed our focus to the roles of Fur and Fnr in regulation of this gene . 
In Δfur , the reporter activity was up-regulated > 9-fold ( Figure 5A ) , which confirmed the microarray data . 
The addition of dip increased the rate of synthesis by 25-fold in Δfur . 
One known repressor of hmpA is Fnr [ 21,95-97 ] . 
Therefore , we combined the fur and the fnr deletions ( ΔfurΔfnr ) in the hmpA-lacZ background to determine the role of Fur and Fnr in the regulation of hmpA . 
Deletion of fnr increased the rate of hmpA-lacZ synthesis by 216-fold as compared to the parent strain ( Figure 5B ) . 
The synthesis of hmpA-lacZ in the Δfnr mutant background was similar to that seen in the Δfur treated with dip ( i.e. , 1253 ± 107 and 1403 ± 280-U/OD600 ) . 
The lack of an obvious Fur binding motif upstream of hmpA indicates that reporter activity seen in Δfur was likely indirect . 
The combined deletion of fur and fnr in the hmpA-lacZ strain increased the rate of synthesis 746-fold as compared to the WT strain ( i.e. , 4328 ± 90 vs. 5.8 ± 2.4 - U/OD600 ) ( Figure 5 ) . 
Thus , the rate of synthesis of hmpA-lacZ in ΔfurΔfnr was ~ 3.5-fold higher than the rate of synthesis in Δfnr ( i.e. , 4328 ± 90 vs. 1253 ± 107 - U/OD600 ) . 
Since we did not identify a discernable Fur binding site in hmpA , the fact that there is no published report showing Fur binding to the regulatory region of hmpA , and that the expression of hmpA-lacZ in ΔfurΔfnr was ~ 3.5-fold higher than in Δfnr demonstrates that under anaerobic conditions , Fur is indirectly regulating hmpA-lacZ independent of Fnr . 
localized to the bacterial membrane . 
The importance of these genes during infection is unknown . 
Several putative genes appear to be under direct control of Fur . 
Genes that exhibited reduced expression in Δfur were the putative universal stress protein encoded by ynaF , the putative glutamate synthase ( STM2186 ) , the putative sugar kinase ( STM3600 ) , and the putative lipoprotein ( STM3690 ) . 
The putative Fur binding site for ynaF and STM3600 is located on the reverse strand for these genes . 
The mechanism of Fur activation of these putative genes is unknown . 
In addition , several putative genes exhibited up-regulation in Δfur . 
A putative glutamic dehydrogenase ( STM1795 ) , a putative glu-taredoxin ( yffB ) , and a putative protein ( yggU ) , were all up-regulated in Δfur . 
Interestingly , yffB is predicted to be a glutathione-dependent thiol reductase . 
The contribution of these genes to infection is unknown . 
The TonB siderophore receptor gene , iroN , was upregulated 9.1-fold in Δfur . 
Despite the widespread study of siderophores ( salmochelins ) in Salmonella virulence , we were unable to find any published report that Fur represses iroN . 
Although Fur repression of the iroBCDE loci is known [ 59 ] , iroN is encoded downstream of this operon and is transcribed in the opposite orientation . 
Our results confirm the prediction by Baumler et al that iroN is regulated by Fur [ 58 ] . 
( Figure 4A ) . 
As expected , the oxygen sensitive regulator Fnr did not impact regulation of ftnB in aerobic conditions ( Figure 4A ) . 
This indicated that Fur is required for ftnB expression , independent of Fnr . 
Data in Figure 4B show that the absence of fur resulted in a 2-fold reduction in the rate of synthesis ( U/OD600 ) of ftnB-lacZ under anaerobic conditions . 
Furthermore , the ferrous iron chelator , dip , reduced the rate of anaerobic synth-esis of ftnB-lacZ in the WT strain by > 2-fold ( Figure 4B ) . 
In Δfur , the rate of synthesis was further reduced ( > 10-fold ) when compared to the WT parent strain treated with dip ( Figure 4B ) . 
In addition , the rate of synthesis in the parent strain was greatest under anaerobic conditions due to the active roles of both Fnr and Fur ( Figure 4 ) . 
Collectively , full expression of ftnB is dependent on Fur in aerobic and anaerobic conditions , whereas Fnr is a strong activator in the absence of O2 . 
c. Regulation of hmpA The gene coding for the flavohemoglobin ( hmpA ) , a NO · detoxifying protein [ 95-98 ] , was differentially expressed in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Expression of hmpA is repressed by Fnr and another DNA binding protein that contains an iron sulfur cluster , NsrR [ 21,95-97 ,99 ] . 
Repression of hmpA by two regulators that are sensitive to RNS allows derepression of this gene under conditions of increased RNS . 
Indeed , regulation of hmpA-lacZ was induced ~ 80-fold by the nitro-sating agent sodium nitroprusside in aerobic conditions ( B. Troxell and H.M. Hassan , unpublished data ) . 
Under anaerobic conditions , hmpA was up-regulated 4-fold in Δfur . 
Thus , we examined its anaerobic regulation with a chromosomal hmpA-lacZ transcriptional fusion . 
Figure

For ( A ) and ( B ) representative data are shown with the differential rate of synthesis ( U/OD600 ) ± standard deviations from three independent experiments listed 
Identification of new Fur targets 
Table 3 shows genes differentially regulated in Δfur that contain a putative Fur binding site located within -400 to +50 nucleotides relative to the translational start site . 
The putative translocase subunit , yajC , was up-regulated 3.2-fold in Δfur . 
This gene is predicted to be in the Sec-dependent pathway of protein export . 
At least one other gene of the Sec-dependent pathway of protein export was up-regulated in Δfur , secY . 
This gene , secY , is a direct target of Fur regulation in Neisseria meningitides [ 100,101 ] . 
Indeed , we detected a putative Fur binding site upstream of secY ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
The role of yajC during infection is unknown , but our results suggest Fur controls Sec-dependent protein secretion . 
NrdR is a global transcriptional regulator that controls expression of oxygen-dependent and independent ribo-nucleotide reductases [ 102-104 ] . 
Expression of nrdR was up-regulated in Δfur and a putative Fur binding site was identified . 
Although , deletion of fur results in up-regula-tion of nrdHIEF [ 105 ] , a class Ib ribonucleotide reductase , we did not detect increased expression of this operon in our conditions . 
However , we did detect upregulation of the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase , nrdAB , in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
The class III oxygen sensitive ribonucleotide reductase , encoded by nrdDG , is encoded in an operon . 
Expression of nrdD , the first gene of this operon , was down-regulated in Δfur 2.5-fold . 
( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Our data indicate that Fur controls the class Ib and III ribonucleotide reductases , either directly or indirectly , under anaerobic conditions . 
A putative dehydrogenase ( STM1133 ) was down-regu-lated 4.2-fold in the Δfur ( Table 3 ) . 
This gene contains a putative Fur binding site on the reverse DNA strand . 
STM1133 is the final gene in an apparent four gene operon of unknown function ( STM1130-1133 ) . 
The first gene of this operon , STM1130 , was also down-regulated 7.9-fold in Δfur ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) ; however , a Fur binding site was not identified upstream of STM1130 . 
Interestingly , this operon is composed of the putative N-acetylneuraminic acid mutarotase ( STM1130 ) , a putative outer membrane protein ( STM1131 ) , a putative sialic acid transporter ( STM1132 ) , and a putative NAD ( P ) binding dehydrogenase ( STM1133 ) . 
Thus , our results suggest Fur controls at least a portion of this operon that may be 
Discussion
Iron is essential in most pathogenic bacteria , which compete rigorously with the host for this element . 
S. Typhimurium is no exception . 
The 17-kDa transcriptional regulator , Fur , plays an important role in bacterial iron homeostasis . 
Although publications of Fur regulation in E. coli and other bacteria are numerous , this is the first report on the global role of Fur in anaerobically grown S. Typhimurium . 
Indeed , anaerobic metabolism has been shown to be important for pathogens and pathogenesis [ 21-24 ,29 ] . 
In this study , we found that , under anaerobic conditions , Fur directly or indirectly affected the expression of 298 genes ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
A putative Fur binding motif was identified in 49 genes ( Table 4 . 
column # 1 ) . 
Also , Table 4 shows evidence of published data demonstrating the role of Fur in their regulation ( column # 3 ) and published experimental evidence for Fur binding to the regulatory region of these genes ( column # 4 ) . 
The role of other co-regulators is also shown ( Table 4 , column # 5 ) . 
Interestingly , twelve of the 49 genes contained the binding motifs for both Fnr and Fur ( Additional file 4 : Table S4 ) . 
The appropriate metal cofactor was shown to be essential for detection of MnSOD activity , in spite of the 9-fold increase in sodA transcript for Δfur . 
Therefore , genetic backgrounds that alter the steady-state [ Mn2 + or its competitor [ Fe2 + ] may have dramatic effects on MnSOD activity . 
Indeed , we were only able to discern the role of Fur in sodA and MnSOD expression with the addition of excess MnCl2 to the growth media . 
These data are summarized in Figure 6 , which depicts the transcriptional , translational , and post-translational role of Fur in sodA and sodB . 
This implies that disruption of iron homeostasis is likely to have a two-pronged effect , increase in Fenton chemistry and a decrease in MnSOD activity due to iron overload . 
It appears that the inhibition of MnSOD by iron is evolutionarily conserved . 
Thus , the mitochondrial Mn2 + - cofactored SOD2 has been shown to be inactivated in a similar manner when iron homeostasis was disrupted in yeast [ 106 ] . 
In addition , supplementation of the medium with Mn2 + reduced oxidative stress in a murine model of hemo-chromatosis [ 107 ] . 
It is unknown if this is due to enhanced MnSOD or if Mn2 + supplementation reduces oxidative stress in other pathological states of altered iron homeostasis . 
Our decision to further study ftnB and hmpA was due to our previous findings , where we found that ftnB and hmpA were activated and repressed by Fnr , respectively [ 21 ] . 
The Fnr-dependent expression of ftnB was apparent from the reduced activity in Δfnr under anaerobic conditions , and the reduced activity in the WT strain in presence of oxygen . 
In addition , iron chelation and the deletion of fur reduced ftnB expression regardless of the oxygen tension . 
These results indicated that Fur controlled regulation of ftnB is independent of Fnr . 
Our results are in agreement with earlier work that demonstrated dependence of ftnB expression on Fur [ 15 ] . 
However , they are contrary to a previous report , which determined that Fur exhibited a repressive role on ftnB expression [ 79 ] . 
The reason for this discrepancy is unclear . 
It is evident from work reported herein and in a previous study in E. coli that ftnB exhibits a strong dependence on low O2 conditions [ 108 ] . 
Furthermore , the earlier study [ 108 ] determined that Fnr bound the promoter of ftnB in E. coli and that the Fnr binding site was further upstream than in known Fnr regulated genes . 
The same investigators [ 108 ] , postulated that Fnr was unable to induce ftnB and that other regulators were required . 
However , we have determined that Fnr alone contributes to the activation of ftnB and that Fur is required for full induction of the gene , with Fnr exhi-biting a more pronounced role . 
The lack of a predicted Fur binding site in ftnB indicated that Fur regulation was indirect . 
The following scenario is proposed to explain these findings and to suggest that the observed regulation of ftnB by Fur is mediated by the histone-like protein H-NS . 
First , the microarray data showed that Fur negatively regulates the expression of hns and has a predicted Fur binding site ( Table 3 ) . 
Second , we recently demonstrated that Fur binds upstream of hns in a metal dependent fashion [ 29 ] . 
Third , whole genome ChIP ana-lysis demonstrated that H-NS binds to ftnB and the expression of ftnB is up-regulated in the absence of hns [ 31 ] . 
Fourth , the tdc operon is a known target for H-NS repression [ 31,76 ] and was significantly reduced in the absence of fur . 
Therefore , we propose that the positive regulation ftnB by Fur is mediated by the negative regulation of hns by Fur . 
Thus removal of Fur ( i.e. , as in Δfur ) results in repression of ftnB by H-NS ( see Figure

Figure 6 Role of Fur in the transcriptional , translational and post-translational regulation of sodA and sodB . 
( A ) Repression of sodA by Fur is depicted in addition to the role of Fur in iron homeostasis . 
Iron is known to bind to the active site of MnSODs that leads to inactivation of the enzyme [ 106,124 ] . 
Increased expression of MnSOD was detected only when excess Mn2 + was added to the media in order to out compete the Fe2 + . 
Deletion of fur under iron replete conditions results in increase transcription of sodA , but incorportation of Fe2 + into the active site of SodA resulting in SodA-Fe and an inactive enzyme . 
Addition of excess Mn2 + to the culture media can out compete Fe2 + for the active site of SodA resulting in SodA-Mn and an active enzyme . 
( B ) Indirect regulation of SodB by Fur in S. Typhimurium . 
The small RNAs rfrA and rfrB of S. Typhimurium are likely to function as their homolog ryhB in E. coli in regards to SodB regulation [ 88 ] . 
Our data confirms the Hfq-dependent function of reduced FeSOD activity in Δfur . 
Previous work confirmed the role of Hfq and Fur in SodB expression [ 39 ] . 
Deletion of fur results in increased transcription of the sRNAs ( rfrA and rfrB ) that can pair with mRNA of sodB in an Hfq-dependent fashion and result in the degradation of sodB mRNA . 
However , a combined deletion of hfq in Δfur results in loss of rfrAB-mediated degradation of sodB , and results in the synthesis of SodB protein that gets activated to FeSOD in the presence of Fe2 + 
7 ) . 
A second possibility is reduced Fnr function ( or an additional activator ) in Δfur since several Fnr regulated genes were differentially expressed in Δfur . 
However , our data rule-out this possibility in ftnB regulation by showing the involvement of Fur in the regulation of ftnB under aerobic conditions , where Fnr is inactive . 
H-NS controls diverse functions within the cell and forms complex structures when binding DNA that indicates a central role in DNA topology [ 109-113 ] . 
Similar to Fur , H-NS is a repressor of transcription [ 31,34,35,114 ] . 
This implies that genes controlled by H-NS are regulated by iron through Fur . 
This interaction also demonstrates interaction between two regulators ( Fur and H-NS ) functioning in highly conserved physiological events , regulating a potentially toxic , but needed metal and regulating foreign DNA in a concerted manner . 
Thus , our results provided additional insight into iron-dependent regulation of H-NS . 
Another gene regulated by Fnr or Fur was the NO · detoxifying flavohemoglobin protein encoded by the hmpA . 
This gene ( hmpA ) is repressed by Fnr and contained a putative Fnr binding site , but did not contain a predicted Fur binding site [ 21,95,96 ] . 
Previous work determined that Fur was a repressor of hmpA [ 115 ] . 
However , it was later revealed that the reporter fusion was to the Fur repressed iroC and not to the hmpA [ 116 ] . 
Additionally , a previous report did not reveal a role for Fur in regulation of hmpA [ 97 ] , while two other studies found a modest effect of Fur on hmpA expression [ 98,117 ] . 
NsrR is another repressor of hmpA [ 97 ] . 
Thus , hmpA is repressed by two regulators that contain an iron-sulfur cluster . 
Despite contradictory reports , increased hmpA expression was detected in Δfur . 
Our initial hypothesis was that this was due to reduced Fnr function in Δfur . 
To support this hypothesis , we expected reporter activity to be similar in Δfnr and 
Figure 7 Representation depicting the role of Fur and H-NS in the regulation of ftnB and the tdc operon . 
H-NS confirmed binding sites and transcriptional repression [ 31 ] were compared with our microarray data and Fur repression of hns [ 29 ] . 
Collectively , the data indicate that Fur-dependent activation of ftnB and the tdc operon may be due to the increased expression of H-NS in Δfur , which represses ftnB and the tdc operon . 
Thus , under Fur active conditions ( left panel ) , hns is repressed by Fur thereby blocking H-NS repression of ftnB and the tdc operon ( signified by the circle with an `` X '' ) . 
While under Fur inactive conditions ( right panel ) , the overexpression of H-NS results in the repression of ftnB and the tdc operon under anaerobic conditions 
ΔfurΔfnr backgrounds . 
However , our results did not support this initial hypothesis since ΔfurΔfnr exhibited ~ 3.5-fold increased expression compared to Δfnr ; indicating that Fur regulation was Fnr-independent . 
A striking finding was the shared regulation of several genes by Fur and Fnr . 
Microarray and bioinformatic stu-dies indicated that 12 of the 298 Fur-dependent genes contained a predicted binding site for both Fur and Fnr . 
Thus , these two global regulators may be directly involved in regulation of these 12 genes ( Additional file 4 : Table S4 ) . 
The expression data indicated that Fur and Fnr cooperate in the regulation of these 12 genes . 
For instance , each gene was regulated in the same manner in Δfur or Δfnr ; a gene activated by Fur was also activated by Fnr . 
Lastly , our investigations indicate that Fur indirectly regulates genes that are under control of Fnr or additional regulators with an iron sulfur cluster ( i.e. , ftnB and hmpA ) . 
Furthermore , the observed reduced expression of the ethanolamine operon , frdABD , and dmsABC in Δfur , suggest altered regulation of operons induced under anaerobiosis ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . 
Thus , Fur is an activator of genes that are typically induced under anaerobic conditions . 
Ethanolamine utili-zation within the host is important for S. Typhimurium and the Gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes [ 118,119 ] . 
In addition , Fnr is an activator of the frd and dms operons , which are responsible for anaerobic utili-zation of fumarate and dimethyl sulfide as alternative electron acceptors , respectively [ 120-123 ] . 
Our study of the anaerobic expression of hmpA suggests that it is regulated by Fur , independent of Fnr . 
Clearly , these results suggest Fnr is functional in Δfur and that Fur is regulating genes of anaerobic metabolism ( eut , frd , and dms operons ) through an unknown mechanism .

Conclusions
We demonstrated that Fur is an activator of ftnB in S. Typhimurium , which is likely due to the de-repression of hns in Δfur . 
The strong dependence of ftnB expression on O2 indicates that Fnr is crucial in its regulation . 
Additionally , we presented evidence that Fur indirectly controls hmpA , independent of Fnr . 
We determined that Fur represses sodA transcription , but is required for the maturation of SodA into an active enzyme , MnSOD . 
Finally , we identified new target genes regulated by Fur in S. Typhimurium , and our data support the increasing evidence of enhanced H-NS expression in Δfur .
