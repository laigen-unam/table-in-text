In the current study , four novel avian - defensins ( AvBDs ) ( AvBD2 , 5 , 9 , and 10 ) were identiﬁed in tissues from the Chinese goose ( Anser cygnoides ) . 
The antibacterial activity of the AvBDs showed that all of these AvBDs exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated ( P < 0.01 ) . 
In addition , antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida decreased signiﬁcantly or was completely abolished at 150 mM NaCl ( P < 0.01 ) . 
None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity . 
AvBD2 and AvBD10 were expressed widely , whereas AvBD5 and AvBD9 mRNAs were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues . 
AvBD9 was signiﬁcantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after Salmonella enteritidis infection .

Introduction 
acid residues [ 1 ] . 
In addition to their direct antimicrobial activities , immunomodulatory properties have also been demonstrated . 
Defensins can promote adaptive immunity by the selective recruitment by chemotaxis of monocytes [ 2 ] , T lymphocytes [ 3 ] , immature dendritic cells [ 4 ] and mast cells [ 5 ] to sites of inﬂammation . 
In vertebrates , three different defensin subfamilies ( , and ) exist , which differ in the disulﬁde bridge [ 6 ] . 
In poultry , only the-defensins , which have bonds between C1 C5 , C2 C4 , and C3 C6 , have been reported to exist [ 7 ] . 
Avian - defensins ( AvBDs ) have been studied extensively in birds , and so far over 30 AvBDs have been identiﬁed in several avian species [ 7 -- 11 ] . 
AvBDs attack a wide range of microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria , fungi and yeasts [ 12 ] . 
However , to date , there is no report of the characterization of AvBDs from geese . 
The present study describes the functional characterization of four novel AvBDs derived from the Chinese goose ( Anser cygnoides ) . 
These molecules exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negativ as key mediators of the innate immune response in many animal species , and they provide the ﬁrst line of defense against potential pathogens . 
These peptides are capable of killing a wide variety of bacterial and viral pathogens directly . 
Despite broad divergence in sequence and taxonomy , most AMPs share a common mechanism of action that involves permeabilization of the pathogen cell membrane [ 1 ] . 
One major subclass of AMPs is the group of defensins . 
Defensins are cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides that vary in length from 18 to approximately 100 amino acids and are enriched in hydrophobic and cationic amino Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) have been recognized

2.3. Sequence analysis of anser AvBDs
Basic searches were conducted with a local alignment search tool ( BLAST ) using the four entire AvBDs from the geese . 
Sequences of the other known AvBDs , and some mammalian - defensins were selected for sequence comparison with the four novel anser AvBDs . 
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Clustal V routine of the MegAlign program provided in the DNAStar package ( Windows 4.05 , DNAStar , Madison , WI , USA ) [ 13 ] . 
The signal peptides of the four novel anser AvBDs were analyzed using the SignalP 3.0 server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/Services/signalP ) . 
2.4. Protein expression and puriﬁcation
The DNA fragments , which encoded these anser AvBDs were ampliﬁed by PCR from the plasmids described above using the primers for protein expression shown in Table 1 . 
The PCR products were inserted into the pGEX-6p-1 vector ( Amersham ) , transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells , and then induced with isopropyl - - d-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . 
The proteins were puriﬁed using a puriﬁcation and refolding kit ( no. 70123-3 ; Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The fusion proteins were resolved by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate -- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS -- PAGE ) at 80 V , using the Mini-protean III system ( Bio-Rad , Beijing , China ) and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 [ 14 ] .

essentially as described [ 15 ] . 
Brieﬂy , fresh goose blood was collected , washed twice with PBS , and diluted to 0.5 % in PBS with and without the addition of 10 % PBS , followed by dispensing 90 l into 96-well plates . 
Different concentrations of peptides ( 10 l ) dissolved in 0.01 % acetic acid were added in duplicate to the cells ◦ for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min , the supernatants were transferred to new 96-well plates and monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm for released hemoglobin . 
Controls for 0 and 100 % hemolysis consisted of cells suspended in PBS only and in 1 % Triton X-100 , respectively . 
The hemolytic activities of defensins were determined and incubated at 37 C 
2.9. Bacterial challenge and expression analysis in geese
above were used to study the tissue distribution of these The thirty-ﬁve 15-day-old healthy geese mentioned 
AvBD mRNAs in healthy geese and in geese after bacterial challenge . 
At the beginning of the study , ﬁve geese were euthanized by intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbitone to study the constitutive expression of the defensin mRNAs in geese . 
Twenty-three tissues , namely the skin , tongue , esophagus , larynx , glandular stomach , muscular stomach , trachea , lung , heart , liver , kidney , breast muscle , spleen , bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , Harderian glands , thymus , cecal tonsil , small intestine , cecum , rectum , large intestine , and pancreas , were rinsed , dissected immediately , and squeezed between Whatman ﬁlter papers to remove excess blood . 
They were then rinsed in cold sterile saline , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 70 ◦ C until further use . 
S. enteritidis ( ATCC 3021 ) were grown to log phase and collected . 
The remaining 30 geese were allotted randomly to two groups ( n = 15 per group ) . 
Geese in one of the groups were gavaged orally with 0.5 ml per bird of inoculum containing approximately 6 5 × 10 organisms of S. enteritidis . 
The control group ( n = 15 per group ) were housed in similar environmental conditions , and 0.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) was introduced by gavage to each bird . 
The in vivo bacterial challenge of the experimental animals was in concordance with the accepted welfare guidelines of the institution . 
Five birds in each group were sacriﬁced at 24 , 48 , and 72 h , respectively after infection and the bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , Harderian glands , thymus , cecal tonsil , spleen , and small intestine of each bird were collected , rinsed in cold sterile saline , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 70 ◦ C until further use . 
The presence of Salmonella in the infected birds was con-ﬁrmed using Salmonella/Shigella ( SS ) agar ( Fluka ) . 
The small intestine of each infected bird was tested for Salmonella by plating different dilutions of the small intestinal contents , resuspended in PBS , on SS selective agar plates . 
Using this medium , growth of the S. enteritidis species is uninhibited and it appears as a colorless colony with a black center ( data not shown ) . 
2.10. Real-time RT-PCR
The levels of AvBD mRNA in tissues from geese were measured with the real-time RT-PCR method using SYBR Premix EX TaqTM ( Takara Biotechnology , Dalian , China ) . 
Equal amounts of tissues ( 1 g ) were used to process the tissue ﬂuid . 
The total cellular RNAs were extracted and RT was performed as described above . 
Real-time PCR was performed with the LightCycler ® 480IIReal-Time PCR system ( Roche , Switzerland ) according to previous studies [ 16,17 ] . 
Furthermore , the speciﬁcity of the reaction was checked by cloning and sequencing three independent PCR products along with the melting curve analysis . 
2.11. Statistics
Data are expressed as the mean ± SD . 
Statistical analyses , where appropriate , were performed using one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using the GLM procedure of SAS software [ 18 ] . 
A difference with P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant

3. Results
3.1. Identiﬁcation of four novel goose defensins
To identify potential defensins in the goose , four sets of primers were designed on the basis of the coding sequences of AvBD2s , AvBD5 , AvBD9s and AvBD10s from either chicken or duck , respectively . 
Four novel anser AvBDs were identiﬁed in the bone marrow , spleen , and kidney using these four sets of primers . 
The complete nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs contained 195 bp , 201 bp , 204 bp , and 207 bp open reading frames ( ORFs ) , and encoded 64 , 66 , 67 and 68 amino acids , respectively ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The predicted amino acid sequence of all of these peptides had the six cysteine residues and the GXC motif that are conserved across all - defensins ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The full-length sequence of the ﬁrst peptide ( 64 amino acids ) showed a high percentage of amino acid homology ( 81.2 % , 93.8 % , 77.8 % and 82.8 % ) with AvBD2s from chicken , duck , ostrich and turkey , respectively . 
The full-length sequence of the second peptide ( 66 amino acids ) showed the highest percentage of amino acid homology ( 84.8 % ) with chicken AvBD5 . 
The full-length sequence of the third peptide ( 67 amino acids ) showed a high percentage of amino acid homology ( 86.6 % , 86.6 % , and 85.1 % ) with AvBD9 from chicken , duck , and quail , respectively . 
Finally , the full-length sequence of the last peptide ( 68 amino acids ) showed a high percentage of amino acid homology ( 82.4 % , 92.7 % , and 77.9 % ) with AvBD10 from chicken , duck , and quail , respectively . 
Based on these analyses , these four novel defensins were identiﬁed conclusively as - defensin orthologs in the goose and were named anser AvBD2 , AvBD5 , AvBD9 , and AvBD10 , respectively . 
Phylogenetic analysis was done on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the reported avian and some mammalian - defensins . 
The data indicated that the anser AvBD2 , AvBD5 , AvBD9 , and AvBD10 peptides grouped together in a single sub-cluster with AvBD2 , AvBD5 , AvBD9 , and AvBD10 from other avian species ( Fig. 2 ) . 
3.2. Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant anser AvBDs
High levels of expression of all of these anser AvBDs were noted in E. coli after induction with 0.6 mM IPTG ( Fig. 3 ) . 
All of the recombinant AvBDs-pGEX ( molecular weight , 30 kDa ) were produced as inclusion bodies ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These peptides were puriﬁed and visualized as a pronounced band on SDS-PAGE gels ( Fig. 3 ) . 
3.3. Antibacterial properties of anser AvBDs
The survival of 12 bacterial strains treated with GST , anser rAvBD , and sAvBD peptides was determined using colony counting . 
The data are depicted in Fig. 4 and show that GST showed no bactericidal activity against any of the bacterial strains investigated . 
In contrast , all of the anser AvBDs showed high and similar antibacterial activity against S. aureus , B. cereus , B. bronchiseptica , and P. aeruginosa ( P < 0.01 ) . 
However , low bactericidal activity was found for rAvBD2 against M. tetragenus , Lactobacillus , P. multocida , S. enteritidis , S. pullorum , E. coli , and S. choleraesuis , when compared with the other AvBDs ( P < 0.05 ) . 
In addition , rAvBD2 showed no signiﬁcant bactericidal activity against P. mirabilis ( P > 0.05 ) . 
Anser rAvBD9 and 10 showed higher bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial strains investigated than the other proteins ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Moreover , the antimicrobial activities of sAvBD2 against M. tetragenus , P. mirabilis , S. pullorum , E. coli , and S. choleraesui

However , low bactericidal activities were observed for sAvBD5 , 9 , and 10 against Lactobacillus , sAvBD5 and 10 against P. multocida and S. enteritidis , and sAvBD10 against S. choleraesuis when compared to the rAvBDs ( P < 0.05 ) . 
3.4. Effect of ionic strength on antibacterial activity of anser AvBDs
aureus and P. multocida were determined in the presence of 0 , 20 , 50 , 136 , and 150 mM NaCl . 
It was shown that all of the anser AvBDs maintained their bactericidal activities The antibacterial activities of anser AvBDs against S. up to 136 mM NaCl ( Fig. 5 ) . 
However , at 150 mM NaCl , the antibacterial activity of all of the anser AvBDs against S. aureus decreased signiﬁcantly ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Furthermore , the antibacterial activity of all of the anser AvBDs against P. multocida was completely abolished at 150 mM NaCl . 
3.5. Cytotoxicity of anser AvBDs
To evaluate the hemolytic activity of anser AvBDs against red blood cells , freshly isolated goose erythrocytes were incubated with these rAvBDs and sAvBDs , together with Triton X-100 as a positive reference . 
Hemolysis was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm fo released hemoglobin , as described above . 
The hemolytic activities of all of the anser AvBDs were similar , and little hemolysis of goose erythrocytes was observed at any concentration of AvBDs ( P > 0.05 ) ( Fig. 6 ) .

3.6. Tissue distribution
Constitutive expression of these four novel AvBDs was detected by real time RT-PCR in various tissues from ﬁve healthy geese ( Fig. 7 ) . 
Expression analysis data revealed that AvBD2 was expressed widely in all the tissues examined except the rectum . 
The highest level of expression was detected in the spleen . 
A moderate level of expression was observed in the tongue , glandular stomach , trachea , lung , heart , kidney , breast muscle , bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , and pancreas . 
Lower levels of expression , were detected in the other tissues investigated . 
In contrast to the pattern of expression of AvBD2 , the AvBD5 mRNA was expressed only moderately in 10 tissues , namely skin , tongue , spleen , bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , Harderian glands , thymus , cecal tonsil , small intestine , and cecum . 
Similarly , AvBD9 was expressed at a low level in only six tissues : skin , larynx , heart , liver , Harderian glands , and rectum . 
In contrast to the pattern of expression of both AvBD5 and AvBD9 , AvBD10 was expressed widely in all tissues of the geese except the skin , tongue , glandular stomach , kidney , breast muscle , and cecum , with a moderate level of expression in the esophagus , muscular stomach , trachea , lung , heart , bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , spleen , Harderian glands , and pancreas , and a low level of expression in the other tissues . 
3.7. Effects of infection on defensin mRNA expression
In order to investigate whether the expression of AvBD mRNAs in tissues from geese was constitutive or inducible in response to S. enteritidis infection , geese were infected orally with S. enteritidis . 
The results showed that highly signiﬁcant upregulation of the level of expression of AvBD2 in both bone marrow ( P < 0.01 at 72 h ) and small intestine ( P < 0.01 at 48 h and 72 h ) was observed when the geese were infected with S. enteritidis . 
Similarly , the level of expression of AvBD5 in both spleen and small intestine of geese was increased signiﬁcantly 72 h after infection ( P < 0.01 ) ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Furthermore , signiﬁcant induction was observed for AvBD9 expression in the bone marrow ( at 24 h , 48 h and 72 h ) , bursa of Fabricius ( at 24 h and 72 h ) , thymus ( at 24 h ) , cecal tonsil ( at 24 h , 48 h and 72 h ) , and spleen ( at 48 h ) from infected geese . 
Similar to the expression patterns of both AvBD2 and AvBD5 , highly signiﬁcant upregulation of AvBD10 expression in bone marrow ( P < 0.01 at 48 h ) , bursa of Fabricius ( P < 0.01 at 72 h ) , and small intestine ( P < 0.01 at and 72 h ) was observed in geese after infection ( Fig. 8 ) . 
4. Discussion
Among avian species over 30 AvBDs have been identiﬁed , from chicken and other avian species . 
To date , however , no defensins have been reported in the goose . 
The discovery of four homologues , AvBD2 , 5 , 9 , and 10 in the goose is important , because it shows that geese possess multiple - defensins , as is known to occur in other animals . 
Multiple sequence alignment of all the AvBD sequences revealed eight absolutely conserved amino acids , the six cysteines typical of all defensin molecules , and two GXC motifs that are conserved across all - defensins . 
Similar to the other known AvBDs , all the four anser AvBD molecules had a clear N-terminal signal peptide , which suggests that they are secreted , and a positive charge typical of C-terminal mature antimicrobial peptides , the latter containing discrete groups of cationic and hydrophobic amino acids . 
This structural conformation appears to be key to the antimicrobial activity of AvBDs , because a common mechanism by which AMPs kill bacteria appears to be mediated through physical interactions with negatively charged microbial membrane phospholipids , followed by membrane disruption [ 19 ] . 
As a result of this physical mechanism , these peptide antibiotics are equally effectiv in killing both drug-resistant and susceptible strains with little possibility of inducing resistance [ 19 ] . 
of - defensins revealed that the avian and mammalian defensins were distributed uniformly in these clusters . 
The novel anser AvBD2 , 5 , 9 , and 10 grouped together in different sub-clusters with AvBDs from the other avian species , pointing to a very close evolutionary relationship and a Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences common ancestry of these avian defensins . 
However , these novel anser AvBDs shared low amino acid homology with the respective peptides from mammals ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The four novel anser AvBDs identiﬁed in the current study , in both recombinant and synthetic forms , also demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated . 
In general , the observed antibacterial activity of these anser AvBDs was comparable to the activity range of other known AvBDs [ 1,8 -- 10 ] , although these experiments were done under different settings . 
The present results implied that these AvBDs represent potential candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in geese . 
As has been described for most defensins [ 20 ] , sodium chloride ( at a concentration of 150 mM ) inhibited the antibacterial activity of the anser AvBDs . 
Tomita et al. [ 21 ] reported similar effects of other salts , with a higher inhibitory activity of divalent ions , which indicates that the ionic strength and not the speciﬁc ions are the cause of the inhibition . 
Disruption of the initial interaction between the negatively charged membrane of bacteria and the positively charged peptide is thought to be the cause of this dependency of inhibition of activity on ionic strength [ 20 ] . 
Furthermore , in agreement with previous studies on other defensins [ 20,22 ] , none of the novel anser AvBDs showed hemolytic activity . 
These results suggest that defensins ar non-toxic to animal cells at concentrations that are bactericidal . 
previous studies of the other known AvBDs [ 1,8 -- 10 ] , that both AvBD2 and AvBD10 were expressed in several The present results showed , in partial agreement with epithelial tissues from geese . 
This suggests that both AvBDs are expressed as part of the epithelial innate defense system and function to prevent potentially pathogenic microbes from interacting with epithelial surfaces and invading the tissues . 
Interestingly , constitutive expression of AvBD2 , 5 , and 10 was observed in tissues of immunological importance , such as the bone marrow , thymus , cecal tonsil , bursa of Fabricius , Harderian gland , and spleen of geese . 
The results imply that , apart from direct antimicrobial activity , these molecules may play a role in recruiting immune cells to the sites of pathogen entry , thereby facilitating the development of the adaptive immune response . 
In contradiction to the previous studies for AvBD9 from other avian species [ 1,8,10 ] , a trace amount of AvBD9 was found only in six tissues of geese . 
The difference could be caused by variability in the expression of - defensins between individual animals , of the choice of breed , animal age , and experimental procedures . 
AvBD9 was found to be only expressed in the tongue , esophagus , trachea , brain and bone marrow of 14-day-old chicken [ 15 ] , but widely expressed in the tissues of both 50-old-week layer hens and 49-day-old broilers [ 10 ] . 
Developmental expression study of duck AvBD9 mRNA using 7 - , 14 - , 21 - , and 28-day-old animals showed that AvBD9 was not widely expressed in tissues of ducks until ages of 21-day-old [ 9 ] . 
These results suggested that the age of birds is one of the major impact factor of AvBD9 expression in tissues . 
Furthermore , the present results suggested that goose does not develop completely on 15-day-old . 
- Defensins from both mammals and chickens have been shown to be induced or upregulated in tissues by bacteria including Salmonella [ 1 ] . 
In chickens , AvBD3 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in the tracheal tissues of animals challenged with Haemophilus paragallinarum , but not in other tissues [ 23 ] . 
Similarly , AvBD4 , 5 , 7 , 11 , and 12 were up-regulated signiﬁcantly in the ovaries of chickens infected with S. enteritidis [ 24 ] . 
Consistent with these reports , the present study revealed a signiﬁcant up-regulation of AvBD2 in both bone marrow and small intestine , of AvBD5 in both spleen and small intestine and of AvBD10 in bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , and small intestine of geese infected with S. enteritidis . 
Furthermore , AvBD9 was highly induced in the bone marrow , bursa of Fabricius , thymus , cecal tonsil , and spleen from geese infected with S. enteritidis . 
However , these AvBDs were not signiﬁcantly up-regulated or induced after S. enteritidis infection in the other tissues investigated . 
Challenge of geese with S. enteritidis resulted in up-regulation or induction of these AvBDs in the small intestine and most of the immune organs investigated . 
These data provide evidence that these AvBDs are induced in response to both local and systemic stimuli . 
Although we have no proof of increased peptide synthesis , the results suggest that these AvBDs are inducible peptides , and may have functions in addition to antimicrobial activity . 
In summary , we have isolated four novel AvBDs from geese , and these peptides possess antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria .

They were expressed widely , especially in immune tissues of geese . 
Furthermore , they were up-regulated or induced in some immune tissues and in the small intestine of geese in response to S. enteritidis infection and may form an integral part of the innate host defense system of the goose .
