In order to construct a conditional lethal Salmonella mutant , an arabinose-regulated recombinant genetic system was used . 
The Salmonella aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( asd ) gene was localized under the control of araC ParaBAD in a plasmid to create the araC ParaBAD : : asd cassette . 
The cassette was cloned into a plasmid carrying a p15A replication origin to create the recombinant plasmid pMMP55 . 
The growth of Salmonella MMP10 harboring pMMP55 was dependent on the presence of arabinose . 
In the presence of arabinose , the Asd deﬁciency due to chromosomal deletion of asd in the Salmonella host was complemented by the asd gene transcribed and translated under the ParaBAD promoter and araBAD Shine -- Dalgarno ( SD ) sequence in pMMP55 . 
Growth inhibition of the strain was demonstrated by arabinose depletion in M9 minimal medium , indicating that the strain were unable to grow in an arabinose-limited environment . 
In addition , the analysis of a 50 % lethal dose ( LD50 ) using mice revealed that the strain MMP10 exhibited attenuation by approximately 100-fold relative to that of the unmodiﬁed strain . 
In conclusion , these data suggest that the araC ParaBAD : : asd system developed in this study can be used to construct conditional lethal Salmonella mutants for application as safe , live-attenuated Salmonella vaccines .

1. Introduction
abstract
Salmonella enterica infects human beings and domestic animals and can cause severe diseases such as enteritis ( Barrow et al. , 2004 ; Wigley et al. , 2002 ) . 
When Salmonella infection is not properly treated , it causes systemic infection or even death ( reviewed by Stevens et al. , 2009 ) . 
Live-attenuated Salmonella vaccines have been developed by constructing mutant strains with deletions of genes involved in virulence . 
These live vaccine strains efﬁciently elicit mucosal and humoral immune responses and provide effective protection efﬁcacy against diseases ( Sirard et al. , 1999 ; Spreng et al. , 2006 ) . 
Additionally , the delivery system carrying foreign antigens using live-attenuated Salmonella is considered an effective tool for triggering the mucosal and humoral immune responses against the

target antigens of other pathogens ( Kang et al. , 2002 ; Zhao et al. , 2008 ) . 
However , concerns on safety still remain for these strains due to the possibility of reversion to virulent type and environmental contamination due to survival ex vivo . 
The live strain can spread in the natural environment after oral administration due to release through stool ( Pusterla et al. , 2009 ) . 
In this respect , it is necessary to generate a safe genetically modiﬁed organism ( GMO ) whose ex vivo growth can be effectively inhibited . 
In this study , we developed a conditional lethal Salmonella mutant construct for application as a safe live Salmonella vaccine . 
The recombinant vectors were prepared via fusion at the translational level between araC ParaBAD and the asd gene for construction of strains unable to survive ex vivo . 
Free arabinose is rarely present in the natural environment ( Munster , 1993 ) ; because the syntheses of some essential cell components are regulated by arabinose , the strains harboring araC ParaBAD : : asd are expected to undergo sequential cell death under arabinose-depleted conditions ( Kong et al. , 2008 ) . 
The strains harboring the recombinant vectors were examined for growth inhibition in an arabinose-rich medium and in the absence of arabinose . 
In addition , property of virulence attenuation for the conditional lethal mutant was evaluated through the analysis of LD50 using BALB/c mice

The bacterial strains , plasmids , and oligonucleotides used for this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . 
S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli were grown at 37 °C in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) or M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1.5 % agar ( Bertani , 1951 ) . 
Antibiotics were added to the culture media at the following concentrations : ampicillin , 100 μg / ml ; streptomycin , 50 μg / ml . 
When required , L-arabinose was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2 % in the medium . 
2.2. General DNA manipulations
DNA manipulations were conducted as described by Sambrook et al. ( 1989 ) . 
Plasmids were introduced into E. coli competent cells via heatshock with RbCl2 treatment ( Hanahan , 1983 ) and into Salmonella competent cells via electroporation . 
2.3 . 
Construction of recombinant plasmids carrying araC ParaBAD : : asd fusion 
Using the primer set araB-F-NcoI and araC-R-BglII ( Table 2 ) , a 1.6-kb araC ParaBAD DNA segment was PCR-ampliﬁed from the S. typhimurium | 3339 chromosome as a template . 
The ampliﬁed DNA fragment was cloned into a T-vector ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) , resulting in the recombinant plasmid pMMP44 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The 1.6-kb NcoI-PstI araC ParaBAD DNA fragment of pMMP44 was ligated to pYA3332 DNA after digestion by both NcoI and PstI and was designated as pMMP51 . 
PCR ampliﬁcation of the asd gene was performed with the S. typhimurium | 3339 chromosome as a template using the primer set asd-F-BspHI and asd-R-XbaI ( Table 2 ) . 
The ampliﬁed 1.3-kb DNA fragment was cloned into a T-vector , resulting in pMMP45 . 
For the in-frame fusion between the araC ParaBAD and asd gene , the 1.3-kb BspHI-XbaI asd DNA fragment of pMMP45 was cloned into the 3.0-kb NcoI-XbaI DNA of pMMP51 , in which the asd gene segment was not present , to create pMMP55 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The pMMP55 plasmid carried a p15A-based replication origin . 
To construct an araC ParaBAD-controlled asd system in a plasmid carrying the pBR ori , a 3.3-kb HindIII-XbaI DNA fragment of pMMP55 was ligated to a 1.5-kb HindIII-XbaI DNA segment containing the pBR ori region of pYA3342 . 
This plasmid was designated pMMP69 . 
2.4. DNA concentration of plasmids
The E. coli | 6212 harboring plasmids were incubated for overnight , diluted 1:100 in pre-warmed fresh medium , and grown to midexponential phase . 
The optical densities at 600 nm were adjusted to 0.5 to quantify the copy numbers . 
Equal aliquots of each culture were collected by centrifugation and the plasmids were prepared using a Plasmid Mini-Prep Kit ( Solgent , South Korea ) . 
The isolated plasmids were separated on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide ( 0.5 µg / ml ) . 
The covalently closed monomer plasmids were quantiﬁed using Gel Doc 2000 ( Bio-Rad ) . 
2.5. Conditions for growth assays
To examine bacterial growth , each strain was cultivated on LB or M9 agar with or without arabinose for 12 -- 16 h at 37 °C . 
LB culture inoculated with 0.01 % ( v/v ) pre-culture was examined at OD600 0.8 or 2.0 for the exponential or stationary phases , respectively . 
The bacterial cells were harvested via centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 rpm , and the cell pellet was washed three times with PBS buffer ( pH 7.2 ) to eliminate cell-associated residual arabinose or diaminopimelic acid ( DAP ) , an intermediate for cell wall biosynthesis ; the Asd protein is involved in DAP biosynthesis . 
The washed cells were serially diluted , and 5 µl were spotted onto LB agar plates supplemented with or without arabinose . 
The plates were incubated for 12 -- 16 h at 37 °C . 
Cultures from M9 minimal media supplemented with arabinose were examined at OD600 0.8 .

The animal experiments adapted in this study were conducted under approval from the Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Korean Council on Animal Care ( AEC-20100730-0002 ) . 
3. Results and discussion
3.1 . 
Construction of the genetic system for conditional bacterial growth 
Although live-attenuated vaccines can more effectively induce host immunity than can dead-cell vaccines , there are always concerns regarding safety due to the possibility of live microbes derived from pathogenic bacteria reverting to wild-type and the fact that live-attenuated vaccines made from gene-modiﬁed pathogenic bacteria can be exposed to ex vivo . 
In order to secure non-reversion of the attenuated strains , construction of strains with multiple virulence gene deletions has been attempted ( Kim et al. , 2009 ) . 
Ex vivo exposure of the live GMO strains after immunization through various routes may result in unexpected environmental contamination ( Pusterla et al. , 2009 ) . 
In this study , we constructed a genetic system that allowed none or very limited bacterial survival in ex vivo conditions . 
Aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( Asd ) is required for the biosynthesis of both lysine and of cell wall components in bacteria ( Black and Wright , 1955 ) . 
It has been demonstrated that S. typhimurium , in the absence of asd , is incapable of survival ex vivo ( Kong et al. , 2008 ) and , as such , can not disseminate its resistance genes among bacteria via genetic transformation ( reviewed by Rossolini et al. , 2010 ) . 
The asd-deleted mutant requires supplemental DAP , an essential component for biosynthesis of cell walls ( Galan et al. , 1990 ; Kim et al. , 2007 ; Nakayama et al. , 1988 ) for survival . 
In this study , to construct a system for conditional expression of the asd gene , the asd gene was fused to the araBAD gene at translational level . 
Thus , the asd gene was operated via the araC ParaBAD transcriptional system and the araBAD SD translational system . 
The araC ParaBAD system is known to stringently regulate the expressions of genes downstrea from the promoter ParaBAD ( Lee , 1980 ; Lee et al. , 1987 ) . 
Thus , the expression of the asd gene fused to the ParaBAD promoter may be regulated by the presence or absence of arabinose . 
An overall strategy for asd fusion construction is shown in Fig. 1 . 
The recombinant plasmid pMMP55 carries the recombinant araC ParaBAD : : asd DNA and a p15A replication origin ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The recombinant plasmid pMMP69 carries the recombinant araC ParaBAD : : asd DNA and a pBR origin ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Generally , plasmids carrying p15A and pBR origins maintain 10 -- 12 and 15 -- 20 or more copy numbers/cell , respectively ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
As shown in Fig. 3 , pMMP69 exhibited higher DNA concentration at approximately 7.3 folds than that of pMMP55 . 
In a previous study ( Kong et al. , 2008 ) , asd gene was fused with ParaBAD at the transcriptional level , which carries the asd SD sequence . 
However , the conditional lethal system in this study was under the direct control of transcriptional as well as translational levels of the ara system owing to the translational level fusion with araBAD operon . 
In addition , our system replaced the replication origin with the middle copy plasmid , p15A ori . 
The use of p15A origin-based plasmid pYA3332 resulted in a critically important factor to tightly regulate the ara operator . 
Furthermore , ATG for the translational start codon for asd was replaced with GTG . 
The GTG codon caused a lower expression level of asd ( Kong et al. , 2008 ) . 
However , the use of normal ATG start codon in this study resulted in tight and successful control of asd gene by the ara system . 
3.2. Analysis of arabinose-dependent bacterial growth
S. typhimurium MMP9 , harboring the pYA3332 control plasmid , and S. typhimurium MMP11 , harboring the pYA3342 control plasmid , grew well on LB agar without DAP ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Since the asd genes contained in pYA3332 and pYA3342 were expressed by the existing promoter , the cells containing the plasmids grew in the absence of DAP . 
However , the growth of S. typhimurium MMP10 carrying pMMP55 and MMP12 carrying pMMP69 occurred in an arabinose-dependent manner . 
Both S. typhimurium MMP10 and MMP12 grew fully in the presence of arabinose ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The growth of S. typhimurium MMP10 harboring the p15A replication origin fully depended on the presence of arabinose , while the growth of S. typhimurium MMP12 harboring the pBR originbased plasmid was less dependent on the presence of arabinose . 
The lack of full growth inhibition may have resulted from high levels of background asd transcription from araC ParaBAD : : asd on the plasmid pBR origin in S. typhimurium MMP12 partially complementing the host 's Asd deﬁciency . 
Since S. typhimurium MMP12 harboring the pBR origin-based plasmid was less dependent on the presence of arabinose , MMP12 was excluded from the further study afterward . 
For the quantitative analyses of the bacteria , cells grown in the exponential and stationary phases in LB broth with or without arabinose were serially diluted and plated on LB agar in order to count their CFUs . 
Salmonella cells harboring pMMP55 grown without arabinose revealed 3 and 4 log reductions in CFU in the exponential and stationary phases , respectively , compared to those of the strains grown with arabinose ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Growth inhibition in the system designed in this study was similar or more effective than the growth inhibition seen in other systems such as the heat-sensitive promoter controlled nuclease system ( Ahrenholtz et al. , 1994 ; Schweder et al. , 1992 ) . 
Transcriptional and translational fusions with araB under ParaBAD and AraC control were tightly regulated during gene expression ( Dalbey and Wickner , 1985 ; Kuhn and Wickner , 1985 ; Russell et al. , 1989 ; San Millan et al. , 1989 ) . 
When bacterial cells are grown without arabinose , there would be little or no biosynthesis of the Asd protein due to tight repression of asd gene transcription by the araC ParaBAD promoter . 
3.3. Examination of conditional growth in M9 minimal medium
LB media may contain trace amounts of arabinose in the components of yeast extract and tryptone ( Kong , et al. , 2008 ) . 
Thus , the growth was re-evaluated using M9 minimal media with or without arabinose . 
Salmonella MMP10 did not grow in M9 minimal medium in the absence of arabinose , while it grew well on the medium containing arabinose

DNA concentrations of pMMP55 and pMMP69 . 
DNA preparations were performed by a plasmid mini-prep kit after adjustment of cell mass to the same volumes . 
The concentration of pMMP55 was 7.3 folds lower than that of pMMP69 . 
Salmonella MMP12 also revealed very little or no growth activity on M9 without arabinose . 
This growth pattern was observed consistently for approximately 20 generations ( data not shown ) . 
Genetically modiﬁed microorganisms using an antibiotic-resistant gene as a selection marker may allow the release of recombinant DNA into the surrounding environment ( Ahrenholtz et al. , 1994 ) . 
DNA segments can persist in non-sterile soils for weeks or months ( Romanowski et al. , 1992 , 1993 ) and may be able to transform bacterial cells . 
In this aspect , a conditional lethal system using non-antibiotic-marker genes such as MMP10 can be used to protect the natural environment from dissemination of recombinant DNA . 
MMP10 showed complete inhibition of growth in the arabinose-deﬁcient medium , where conditions were similar to those in the natural environment ( Munster , 1993 ) . 
Therefore , this will be a more suitable vector system for construction of a safe vaccine unable to survive ex vivo . 
3.4. Attenuation of Salmonella mutants
To evaluate attenuation of Salmonella strain MMP10 , the Salmonella mutants were orally administrated to BALB mice at various doses . 
The S. typhimurium strain | 8554 as a control for the complete attenuation showed over 7.3 × 109 CFU for LD50 . 
The S. typhimurium strain harboring a vector plasmid pYA3332 as a control showed 2.9 × 105 CFU at LD50 , similar to those of the wild type S. typhimurium | 3339 ( Table 3 ) ( Kim et al. , 2009 ) . 
However , the Salmonella mutant MMP10 exhibited attenuation by 2 ( 1.9 × 107 CFU ) log LD50 . 
These attenuations were most likely due to decreased survival in vivo owing to cell lysis under arabinose deﬁciency ( Kong et al. , 2008 ) . 
Salmonella infection in the mouse can be arbitrarily divided into several steps ( Dougan et al. , 2011 ) . 
During phase 1 , after penetrating the epithelial barrier , Salmonella disseminates to the liver and spleen via the lymphatic and circulatory systems . 
Phase 2 is a period of replication within cells . 
Phase 3 reaches plateau in bacterial cell numbers with host death dependent on bacterial virulence : ( i ) highly virulent Salmonella strain cell numbers increase continuously until the host is killed ; ( ii ) in the case of less virulent strains Salmonella cell numbers in the liver and spleen fall progressively until complete clearance . 
It is plausible that MMP10 restricted the bursting size of replication in organs due to the arabinose deﬁciency in vivo which might cause clearance of MMP10 in tissues .

Salmonella strains were grown in LB broth until OD600 0.8 ; arabinose was included in the media during this period . 
The cultural broths were streaked onto LB agar media with or without arabinose . 
The results were observed after incubation for 12 -- 16 h at 37 °C .

Conclusions 
The arabinose-dependent asd gene expression system ( araC : : ParaBAD : : asd ) constructed in this study has been examined in asd-deleted S. typhimurium . 
The growth of Salmonella strains containing pMMP55 carrying a p15A replication origin was fully dependent on the presence of arabinose in both enriched ( LB ) and M9 minimal media . 
Thus , pMMP55 may be more suitable to this system since the growth in the presence of arabinose was more tightly regulated . 
In addition , this Salmonella strain exhibited attenuated LD50 in mice . 
As this plasmid is applied to a more secured attenuated host such as CK110 , a triple genes ( lon cpxR asdA16 ) - deleted mutant ( Kim et al. , 2009 ) , a safe , live Salmonella vaccine can be constructed . 
This strain may not be disseminated into the environment since it will not survive ex vivo in the absence of arabinose .
