A novel contractility pathway operating in Salmonella invasion
Jan Hänisch ,1,2 Theresia E.B. Stradal1 ,3 , * and Klemens Rottner1 ,4 observed in macropinocytosis .3 The diffuse ruffling surrounding invading bacteria phenotypically distinguishes this entry mechanism from the so called `` zipper '' mode of bacterial invasion , as used by Listeria , where membrane rearrangements and actin polymerization events are more confined to the bacterial contact and entry oscienc site . 
Thus , during `` zipper '' invasion , thee . 
host membrane extends tightly around the bacterium , which is mediated by virulence proteins on the pathogen surface binding to host cell receptors .3 In contrast , membrane ruffling induced by `` triggering '' Salmonella is ignited by injection of bacteri l v rulen e uatiec.factors into the host cytosol employing a type III secretion system ( TTSS ) . 
A cocktail of injected Salmonella proteins stimulates activation of a central regulator of actin polymerization , the Arp2/3 complex . 
Notably , Arp2/3 complex is commonly considered to be essential for lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling , based e.g. , on RNAi studies and sequestration of the complex in the cytosol.4-6 Recently however , we explored Salmonella entry into host cells virtually incapable of membrane ruffling ,7 which -- to our surprise -- provided the first evidence that S. Typhimurium is also able to enter host cells in the absence of lamelli-podia and ruffles .8 These observations fitted the finding that Arp2/3 complex was also not essential for invasion , but careful comparison of entry efficiencies into host cells abrogated either for ruffling or Arp2/3 complex function revealed an additional layer of complexity . 
First , these analyses indicated that although Arp2/3 complex can contribute to ruffling-dependent entry , it has additional , ruffling-independent functions , and second , Salmonella can 
Our findings have unveiled a novel role for myosin II in Salmonella pathogenesis , adding up to the established function in intracellular positioning of the Salmonellacontaining vacuole ( SCV ) following host cell entry .9 But how does myosin II contribute to Salmonella engulfment ? 
Bacterial association causes formation of actin filament-and myo2 - rich struct 2 sin II01ures at sites of bacteria-host cell contact obviouslyL resembling stress fibers .10 Salmonella thus likely stimulates formation and contraction of these stress fiber-like structures below attached bacteria to eventually drive invagination of the host c ll me ane Deombrn and pulling of the bacteria into the host cell cytosol ( Fig. 1 ) . 
This conclusion is supported both by interference with entry upon inhibition of myosin II-based contractility in most cell types , as well as by the stimulation of entry upon induction of contractility .10 Such a pulling mechanism certainly requires tight interaction of bacteria with the host cell membrane . 
Although this might involve multiple adhesive structures expressed by Salmonella species ,11 a recent study established that part of the TTSS , a complex consisting of three translocases ( SipB , SipC and SipD ) is essential for bacterial association with the host cell surface .12 Internalization of S. typhimurium into host cells is mainly initiated then by translocation into the host cell cytosol of the bacterial effectors SopE , SopE2 and SopB1 ( Fig. 1 ) . 
Among these , SopB appears to constitute the predominant activator of myosin II-mediated engulfment ,10 again in line with the regulatory role of SopB in myosin II-dependent SCV positioning .9 Importantly , in reference 9 , it was described that sole expression of SopB in Hela cells is sufficient to induce myosin II phosphorylation , as assessed origin . 
Interestingly , the Salmonella virulence factor SipC was previously described to be capable of catalyzing actin filament nucleation .21 However , SipC was unable to drive entry and to induce such structures in the absence of either Sop ( isogenic mutant lacking Sops E , E2 and B ) , thus it seems unlikely that SipC alone can efficiently nucleate actin filaments that are subsequently bundled into functional stress fiber-like structures for invasion .10 In addition , ectopic expression of SopB was sufficient to induce stress fiber formation in Hela cells in the absence of any other bacterial factor , thus potential accessory factors should derive from the host cell .9 We can likely exclude Arp2/3 complex as potential actin filament nucleator of contractile entry structures , since this pathway also operated upon Arp2/3 RNAi .10 Potential host cell nucleators involved instead certainly include members of the formin family . 
For instance , the RhoA 2012 L effector and Diaphanous-related formin mDia1 has early been implicated in the formation of cellular stress fibers in cooperation with Rho-kinase-media d m II Dteoyosinn phosphorylation .22 However , mDia1 is not essential for stress fiber formation ,23 and the formin family in mammals comprises 15 members , including additional RhoA effectors .24 Furthermore , recent years of research have unveiled an entire new class of actin nucleators , comprising a growing list of members such as Spire or CordonBleu that assemble actin filaments using clusters of actin monomer binding modules .25 Although involvement of some family members , e.g. , the muscle protein Leiomodin ,26 seems unlikely due to tissue specificity , future efforts addressing this issue could first aim at narrowing down whether these actin filaments are generated by formin-dependent or - independent mechanisms , e.g. , by employing general formin inhibitors .27 Formation of robust stress fiber-like structures at entry sites at the membrane may also involve bundling proteins such as a-actinin ,22 but no data are available at present to determine whether the molecular inventory of bacteria-induced stress fibers at the membrane are by any means different from those anchoring the actin cytoskeleton in substrate adhesions . 
Future work will also have to address this question . 
Trigger vs. Zipper: Still a Valid Concept?
For many years , Salmonella have been considered to solely enter host cells via a macropinocytic uptake mode , the `` trigger mechanism '' of invasion .3 However , evidence for a ruffling-independent , but Arp2/3 complex-dependent entry mode of S. Typhimurium , potentially involving the novel Arp2/3 activator WASH ,8,41 as well as t2 ly de cribed contr nhe new0s12actioL dependent entry pathway10 unravel a more complex situation . 
When looking at further Salmonella serovars , entry strategies in this genus turn out to be even more
