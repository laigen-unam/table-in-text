Recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines have been extensively studied , with a focus on eliciting speciﬁc immune responses against foreign antigens . 
However , very little is known about the innate immune responses , particularly the role of ﬂagellin , in the induction of innate immunity triggered by recombinant attenuated Salmonella in chickens . 
In the present report , we describe two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strains , wild-type ( WT ) or ﬂagellin-deﬁcient ( ﬂhD ) Salmonella , both expressing the fusion protein ( F ) gene of Newcastle disease virus . 
We examined the bacterial load and spatiotemporal kinetics of expression of inﬂammatory cytokine , chemokine , and Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) genes in the cecum , spleen , liver , and heterophils following oral immunization of chickens with the two Salmonella strains . 
The ﬂhD mutant exhibited an enhanced ability to establish systemic infection compared to the WT . 
In contrast , the WT strain induced higher levels of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , CXCLi2 , and TLR5 mRNAs in cecum , the spleen , and the heterophils than the ﬂhD mutant at different times postinfection . 
Collectively , the present data reveal a fundamental role of ﬂagellin in the innate immune responses induced by recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines in chickens that should be considered for the rational design of novel vaccines for poultry . 
Oral live attenuated Salmonella vaccine vectors expressing recombinant foreign antigens have been shown to induce strong and speciﬁc systemic , mucosal , humoral , and cellmediated immune responses against the foreign antigens in human and animal hosts ( 5 , 19 , 27 , 55 ) . 
In addition , Salmonella vectors have the potential to activate innate immune responses and induce inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines in mammals and chickens ( 11 , 23 , 50 , 51 ) . 
In particular , the cytokine environment of the mucosal or systemic inductive sites dictates the subsequent immune response to the carrier antigens ( 9 , 50 , 52 ) . 
Nonetheless , the innate immune responses in chickens following recombinant attenuated Salmonella immunization are still undetermined . 
Flagella are surface appendages of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that are required for motility and chemotaxis . 
Flagellin , a constitutive protein of the ﬂagellar apparatus , is a highly evolutionarily conserved molecule that is recognized by host cells through Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) , contributing to the activation of inﬂammatory responses and secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines during Salmonella infections ( 15 , 24 ) . 
Recently , several studies compared the differences in innate immunity-inducing capacity between wild-type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium and aﬂagellar S. Typhimurium in mice and chickens . 
For instance , Iqbal et al. ( 21 ) observed that the aﬂagellar S. Typhi-murium ﬂiM mutant induced less interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) mRNA and polymorphonuclear cell inﬁltration in the chicken gut than did WT S. Typhimurium during the early stages of infection . 
Further , Simon et al. ( 38 ) found no change in the expression of IL-6 , IL-12 , and gamma interferon ( IFN - ) in the Peyer 's patch , spleen , and liver tissues of infected mice following the challenge with WT and aﬂagellar S. Typhimurium ﬂhC mutant . 
However , these studies mainly used virulent S. Typhimurium strains . 
To the best of our knowledge , there is no clear evidence that the expression of ﬂagellin affects the innate responses induced by recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine strains . 
In the present study , we generated an experimental Newcastle disease ( ND ) vaccine formulation using two recombinant attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine strains that differed in the expression of ﬂagellin . 
The two strains expressed fragments of the fusion protein ( F ) gene of Newcastle disease virus ( NDV ) . 
The fusion protein was previously tested in chickens immunized using a DNA vaccine ( 33 ) . 
In order to deﬁne the contribution of bacterial ﬂagel-lin to the induction of mediators of the host innate immune response in vivo , we analyzed the relative levels of expression of inﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine genes in chickens at various times following oral immunization with two recombinant attenuated S. Typhimurium strains .

X455001 was prepared using the X4550 strain . 
The ﬂhD gene ( ﬂagellum master operon ) was mutated by homologous recombination mediated by the suicide plasmid pGMB151 ( 17 ) . 
An ﬂhD mutant does not synthesize any ﬂagellar components and therefore has no ﬂagellar secretory apparatus . 
E. coli and S. Typhimurium cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth or on LB agar ( Difco , Detroit , MI ) . 
When required , the antibiotics nalidixic acid and kanamycin were added to culture media at 50 g/ml ; diaminopimelic acid ( DAP ) was added ( 50 g/ml ) for the growth of Asd strains . 
Expression of recombinant F protein in S. Typhimurium . 
DNA manipulations were carried out using methods described by Sambrook et al. ( 37 ) . 
Transformation of E. coli and S. Typhimurium was performed by electroporation . 
Transformants containing Asd plasmids were selected on LB agar plates without DAP . 
Only clones containing the recombinant plasmids were able to grow under these conditions . 
A fragment of the F gene from amino acid residue 147 to 344 of the mature F protein of NDV ( 45 , 54 ) was PCR ampliﬁed from pVAX1-F ( 33 ) template DNA using the primers 5 = - AACCATGGGAAATGCTGCCAACATCCTC-3 = ( N terminal ) and 5 = - AAGGATCCATCCAAATCGGTCTCTAC-3 = ( C terminal ) ( restriction sites are underlined and introduced mutations are in bold ) . 
The 0.6-kb ampliﬁed fragment was cloned into the pYA3334 vector , resulting in pYA-F ( Table 1 ) . 
The plasmids pYA3334 and pYA-F were used to transform competent E. coli X6212 . 
All constructs were veriﬁed by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing . 
Upon conﬁrmation , plasmids pYA3334 and pYA-F were electroporated into the X4550 and X455001 strains and Asd transformants were selected on LB plates , resulting in KLZ111 and KLZ112 and vector control strains , KLZ113 and KLZ114 . 
Expression of the F antigen in the cytoplasm and culture supernatants of KLZ111 and KLZ112 was conﬁrmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-NDV chicken polyclonal antibody developed in our laboratory . 
The stability of plasmids was conﬁrmed by the growth of KLZ111 and KLZ112 in LB medium with DAP . 
Motility assay . 
Bacteria were stab inoculated into motility plates ( LB medium containing 0.3 % agar ) . 
Cultures were incubated upright at 37 °C for 12 h and then photographed . 
Immunization with S. Typhimurium vaccine strains . 
Groups of 100 7-day-old Qingke breeder chickens were orally immunized with 5 109 CFU of strain KLZ111 or KLZ112 or mock treated . 
Four birds from each group were sacriﬁced at 1 , 3 , and 5 days postimmunization ( p.i. ) for postmortem analysis . 
At each time point , tissue samples of spleen and cecum were aseptically collected into liquid nitrogen for total RNA extraction . 
Liver , spleen , and cecal contents were obtained for bacterial enumeration . 
Bacterial culture and enumeration were performed as previously described ( 39 ) . 
Brieﬂy , homogenized samples were plated out onto selective Brilliant Green agar ( Difco ) containing 50 g of sodium nalidixate/ml with or without 50 g/ml kanamycin . 
Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before enumeration of the colonies . 
Heterophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of 30 chickens per group at each time point . 
Blood was collected in Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA and mixed thoroughly . 
Following blood collection , heterophils were isolated using the method described by Redmond et al. ( 35 ) . 
All animal experimental protocols were approved by the institute and carried out in accordance with the guidelines for experimental animals established by the Ministry of Science and Technology ( Beijing , China ) . 
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR . 
Tissues or cells were homogenized in TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and total RNA was prepared as directed by the manufacturer . 
RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometer readings at 260 nm . 
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( qRT-PCR ) was performed to measure mRNA expression levels of IL-1 , IFN - , transforming growth factor 4 ( TGF - 4 ) , CXCLi2 , and TLR5 using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II ( Perfect Real Time ; TaKaRa Biotechnology , Dalian , China ) using an ABI 7500 real-time detection system ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA ) . 
All primer sequences have been previously reported : IL-1 , Y15006 ( 49 ) ; IFN - , Y07922 ( 22 ) ; TGF - 4 , M31160 ( 25 ) ; CXCLi2 , AJ009800 ( 47 ) ; TLR5 , AJ626848 ( 21 ) ; and - actin , L08165 ( 28 ) . 
Ampliﬁcation was performed in a total volume of 20 l , containing 10 l of 2 SYBR Premix Ex Taq II , 2 l of the diluted cDNA , and 0.8 l of each primer . 
The real-time PCR program started with denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s , followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s. Dissociation analysis of ampliﬁcation products was performed at the end of each PCR to conﬁrm that only one PCR product was ampliﬁed and detected . 
Data were analyzed with ABI 7500 SDS software ( ABI ) , with the baseline being set automatically by the software . 
The threshold method was used for quantiﬁcation of the mRNA level ( 29 ) and CT values were calculated on the basis of the internal standard - actin signal . 
Results were expressed as 2 CT ( n-fold change compared to the nontreated control group ) . 
Statistical analysis . 
Where speciﬁed , data were analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using an unpaired two-tailed Student t test . 
A P value of 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant . 
RESULTS
Construction of S. Typhimurium vaccine strains carrying the F gene . 
A gene fragment that encodes amino acid residues 147 to 344 ( 594 bp ; 198 amino acids ) of the mature F protein ( 553 amino acids ) was selected to use as a test antigen for antigen delivery by a Salmonella carrier . 
The gene encoding F was introduced into pYA3334 . 
The recombinant plasmid , named pYA-F , was electroporated into the attenuated S. Typhimurium strains X4550 and X455001 , which differ in the expression of ﬂagellin , resulting in the selection of the two vaccine strains , named KLZ111 and KLZ112 , respectively .

A 22-kDa band reacting with an anti-NDV serum was detected in whole-cell extracts of both strains KLZ111 and KLZ112 ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Seeding of the vaccine strains in soft agar plates showed that strain KLZ111 was motile while strain KLZ112 was nonmotile ( Fig. 1B ) . 
To examine the stability of pYA-F in X4550 and X455001 in vitro , KLZ111 and KLZ112 were cultured at a daily passage of 
1:1,000 dilutions for ﬁve consecutive days in LB broth containing DAP . 
Cells obtained from the last-day culture expressed amounts of the 22-kDa F that were similar to those from the ﬁrst day ( data not shown ) , suggesting that both Salmonella vectors stably maintained the harbored plasmids . 
Recovery of recombinant Salmonella after oral immunization . 
Bacterial load is a parameter that may affect the magnitude of the innate immune responses . 
As an initial step in determining the role of bacterial ﬂagellin in the induction of innate immunity in vivo , chickens were orally inoculated with strain KLZ111 or KLZ112 , and bacterial loads in chickens were determined . 
Chickens were sacriﬁced at 1 , 3 , or 5 days p.i. Cecal contents and liver and spleen tissue samples were harvested , and bacterial loads ( log CFU/g ) were measured . 
It was determined that the numbers of cells of strains KLZ111 and KLZ112 were high ( 104 CFU/g ) in cecal contents after immunization , and the level of Salmonella KLZ112 was signiﬁcantly higher than those found in chickens treated with the KLZ111 strain at 1 and 3 days p.i. ( Fig. 2A ) . 
However , the numbers of cells of strains KLZ111 and KLZ112 in the cecal contents were equivalent at 5 days p.i. ( Fig. 2A ) . 
No bacteria were recovered from either the livers or spleens of chickens treated with strains KLZ111 and KLZ112 at 1 day p.i. ( Fig. 2B and C ) . 
In contrast , the numbers of cells of strain KLZ112 found in the liver and spleen at 3 days p.i. were signiﬁcantly higher than those for strain KLZ111 ( Fig. 2B and C ) . 
At 5 days p.i. , the numbers of KLZ112 and KLZ111 bacteria in the liver were comparable , indicating that lack of ﬂagella enhances only the initial phases of systemic colonization . 
The in vitro growth rate of strain KLZ112 in rich medium was similar to that of

Quantiﬁcation of inﬂammatory cytokine , chemokine , and TLR5 mRNA expression in the cecum , spleen , and heterophils following immunization . 
( i ) Cecum . 
Quantitative analysis of IL-1 expression at 1 day p.i. indicated 19.2 - and 14.4-fold increases in KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized chickens , respectively , compared to mock-treated controls ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Although reduced expression of IL-1 was found from 1 day p.i. onwards in the ceca of both KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized chickens , IL-1 levels induced by KLZ111 were signiﬁcantly higher than those induced by KLZ112 at 3 and 5 days p.i. , respectively ( Fig. 3A ) . 
A statistically signiﬁcant ( P 0.05 ) increase in the expression of CXC chemokines ( CXCLi2 ) ( 32.8 - and 20.2-fold increases above control levels , respectively ) at 1 day p.i. was found in ceca from KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized birds compared to mocktreated controls ( Fig. 3B ) . 
CXCLi2 levels induced by KLZ111 were signiﬁcantly higher than those induced by KLZ112 at 1 and 3 days p.i. ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Changes in TGF - 4 mRNA expression were variable over the course of immunization with both recombinant Salmo-nella strains , and levels of TGF - 4 induced by KLZ111 were signiﬁcantly higher than those induced by KLZ112 at 1 day p.i. ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Expression of IFN - mRNA was below the detectable threshold for the assay in this experiment . 
( ii ) Spleen . 
Quantitative analysis of IL-1 and CXCLi2 expression in the spleen showed increases for both KLZ111 ( 16.5 - and 39.1-fold ) and KLZ112 ( 12.9 - and 11.4-fold ) at 1 day p.i. compared to mock-treated controls ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
Reduced expression of IL-1 and CXCLi2 was found from 1 day p.i. onwards in the spleens of both KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized chickens ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
However , IL-1 and CXCLi2 levels induced by KLZ111 were signiﬁcantly higher than those induced by KLZ112 at 1 and 3 days p.i. ( Fig. 4A and C ) . 
In contrast , increased expression of IFN - was detected from 1 day p.i. onwards in the spleens of both KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized chickens , and the level induced by KLZ111 was signiﬁcantly higher than that induced by KLZ112 at 1 and 3 days p.i. ( Fig. 4B ) . 
The expression level of TGF - 4 in the spleen was not statistically signiﬁcantly different for the KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized birds at all time points ( Fig. 4D ) . 
( iii ) Heterophils . 
At the three stages investigated , i.e. , 1 , 3 , and 5 days p.i. , KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized animals exhibited a comparably slight increase in the expression of cytokines and chemokines . 
For IL-1 , enhanced expression was greatest in the KLZ111 - and KLZ112-immunized chickens on day 3 ( 4.7 - and 1.7-fold ) and diminished on day 5 ( Fig. 5A ) . 
On days 1 , 3 , and 5 , there was high expression of CXCLi2 in both groups of recombinant Salmonella-treated animals , signiﬁcantly higher than that found in the controls ( Fig. 5B ) . 
The levels of IL-1 and CXCLi2 were signiﬁcantly increased in heterophils of chickens immunized with KLZ111 compared to those treated with KLZ112 at day 3 and 5 days p.i. , whereas no difference was observed at day 1 ( Fig. 5A and B ) . 
The levels of TGF - 4 in the KLZ111-treated chickens were signiﬁcantly higher than those in the KLZ112-treated chickens at 3 days p.i. ( Fig. 5C ) . 
However , IFN - levels were not signiﬁcantly different in the heterophils of either KLZ111 - or KLZ112-treated birds at all time points ( data not shown ) . 
( iv ) Quantiﬁcation of TLR5 mRNA expression following immunization . 
TLR5 levels were signiﬁcantly different in the ceca and heterophils of KLZ111 - and KLZ112-treated chickens at all time points ( Fig. 6A and C ) . 
Expression of TLR5 in the spleens of both groups of recombinant Salmonella-treated chickens was lower on days 1 and 3 than on day 5 ( Fig. 6B ) . 
However , there was difference in expression in the spleen between KLZ111 - and KLZ112-treated chickens at 1 day p.i. ( Fig. 6B ) . 
DISCUSSION
Recombinant S. Typhimurium strains have been developed for the delivery of heterologous antigens in chickens , and they induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses ( 25 , 31 ) . 
In order to develop novel ND vaccines , we generated two recombinant attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine strains that expressed fragments of the F gene of NDV and determined the inﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine responses in chickens following recombinant attenuated Salmonella immunizations . 
In addition , we used WT and ﬂagellin-deﬁcient strains to delineate the role of ﬂagellin in the elicited innate immune responses . 
The current study determined that the maximal bacterial numbers were recovered from cecal contents at 1 and 3 days after immunization and that the levels for the WT were signiﬁcantly lower than those in animals treated with the ﬂhD mutant strain ; the loads were comparable on day 5 . 
A wide range of ﬂagellin-deﬁcient strains of S. Typhimurium have been examined for invasion compared with that of wild strains in chickens and rodents after administration by either intravenous , intraperitoneal , or oral routes , with sometimes contradictory conclusions ( 8 , 30 , 36 , 38 , 
40 ) . 
Iqbal et al. ( 21 ) showed that the numbers of WT or ﬂiM mutant Salmonella organisms in the cecal contents were equivalent at both 9 and 24 h p.i. in 1-day-old chickens . 
Allen-Vercoe et al. ( 4 ) found that there were no signiﬁcant differences in the levels of WT or ﬂa mutant strains in the cecal contents at both 1 and 7 days p.i. in 5-day-old chickens . 
However , consistent with our studies , the number of aﬂagellate Salmonella organisms recovered from the Peyer 's patches was signiﬁcantly higher than the number of WT bacteria in mice at day 4 p.i. ( 15 ) . 
Despite the growth rates of the two strains being comparable in vitro , higher numbers of ﬂagellin-deﬁcient Salmonella bacteria were detected in the liver and spleen at 3 days p.i. . 
This difference was not observed at 5 days p.i. , and the advantage of aﬂagellar status was short-lived and probably related to an ability to evade early host recognition . 
Although no Salmonella organisms were detected in the liver or spleen with any of the strains at 1 day p.i. ( Fig. 2 ) , the induction of inﬂammatory genes was observed in the spleen in individual animals ( Fig. 4 ) . 
This induction in the spleen at 1 day after immunization correlated well with the bacterial load at the primary site of infection , the cecum ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The early induction of inﬂammatory genes seen in the spleen may have been due to the action of cytokines produced in the cecum . 
Alternatively , induction may also be a result of the release of bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , such as lipo-polysaccharide , peptidoglycan , or ﬂagellin , from the cecum into the circulatory system , followed by ﬁltering through the hepatic portal system or clearance by the reticuloendothelial system ( 15 , 44 ) .

Data shown are the fold changes in mRNA expression compared with that in mock-infected controls , based on triplicate samples from four birds for each time determined and by qRT-PCR . 
Error bars indicate standard deviations of the means . 
* , statistically signiﬁcant difference between chickens immunized with Salmonella strains KLZ111 and KLZ112 ( P 0.05 ) . 
In chickens , the innate immune response to S. Typhimurium infections is induced by the production of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines , including IL-1 , IFN - , IL-6 , TGF - 4 , and CXCLi2 , in in vitro and in vivo models ( 7 , 13 , 52 ) . 
However , these studies mainly used WT strains for their analyses , despite the fact that induction of the innate immune response may be needed to protect chickens before the induction of the speciﬁc immune response ( 52 ) . 
In this study , we found rapid and signiﬁcant cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression in the cecum and systemic sites upon immunization with both recombinant attenuated Salmo-nella strains ( Fig. 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . 
However , there have been contradictory conclusions on the induction of innate immune responses by attenuated Salmonella . 
A previous study reported an upregulation in both IL-1 and IFN - mRNAs in the Peyer 's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes in mice following immunization with attenuated Salmonella constructs at day 7 ( 23 ) . 
Similarly , Ech-channaoui et al. ( 12 ) showed that a wide range of genes , including those for chemokines and Th1 - and Th2-type cytokines , were upregulated in mice immunized with live attenuated recombinant S. Typhimurium strains compared to control mice at day 1 . 
In contrast , Trebichavsky et al. ( 46 ) found that attenuated aroA S. Typhimurium did not induce IL-1 , IL-18 , TNF - , or IFN - in the ileum and plasma in gnotobiotic pigs at 24 h after the infection . 
In mammals , IL-1 is considered an early-response proinﬂammatory cytokine produced by many cells in response to microbial challenge . 
IL-1 is important in the induction of innate response mediators , such as acute-phase proteins and the chemokine CXCLi2 ( 10 ) . 
CXCLi2 is important in recruiting neutrophils to sites of inﬂammation and infection ( 20 ) . 
Our study generally demonstrated rapid and signiﬁcant IL-1 and CXCLi2 mRNA expression upon infection with both recombinant Salmonella strains in the cecum and spleen ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) . 
That is in line with observations from other studies that found prompt expression of IL-1 and CXCLi2 within 2 days of S. Typhimurium infection in the guts and spleens of newly hatched chicks ( 51 ) . 
Moreover , the same study found that S. Typhimurium infection results in a pronounced heterophil inﬂux to the cecal lamina propria and liver . 
It has also been shown that IL-1 mRNA was upregulated in the cecum at day 5 after oral infection with S. Typhimurium ( 13 ) . 
In both organs the expression of the chemokine CXCLi2 along with the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-1 is indicative of an early inﬂammatory response ( 51 ) . 
Remarkably , Withanage et al. ( 52 ) found that infection of chickens with S. Typhimurium induced early expression of chemokines and cytokines in the spleen and gut , accompanied by increased numbers of T cells and the formation of granuloma-like follicular lesions . 
Therefore , we presume that the chemokines and cytokines induced by attenuated recombinant Salmonella in the cecum and spleen may ultimately enhance the induction of the adaptive immune response . 
Heterophils , the avian counterparts of mammalian neutro-phils , modulate innate immune response through phagocytosis of invading microbes and foreign particles , production of oxygen intermediates , and release of proteolytic enzymes ( 42 ) . 
Therefore , heterophil functional efﬁciency is of interest for evaluating the potential efﬁcacy of an innate immune response in chickens . 
Ferro et al. ( 14 ) found signiﬁcant upregulation of proinﬂammatory cytokine ( IL-1 and CXCLi2 ) mRNA expression in heterophils isolated from line A and D chicks , as supported by the current study , where heterophils isolated from chicken immunized with both recombinant attenuated Salmonella strains showed an increase in IL-1 and CXCLi2 mRNA expression at days 3 and 5 p.i. ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Therefore , an increase in proinﬂammatory cytokine mRNA expression in heterophils could result in a more efﬁcient and potentially effective immune response . 
IFN - is a Th1 cytokine that stimulates macrophages to secrete oxidants with antimicrobial activities and is produced by natural killer cells and T lymphocytes ( 3 , 31 ) . 
Previous studies have reported that the rate of clearance of Salmonella infection correlates with an upregulation of IFN - mRNA and a strong T-cell response ( 6 ) . 
Surprisingly , transcripts of IFN - were not detected in the cecum and heterophils and were observed only in the spleen within 5 days after immunization with both recombinant attenuated Salmonella strains in the current study . 
In contrast , Withan-age et al. ( 52 ) showed an upregulation of IFN - mRNA of up to 200-fold in the liver , ileum , and cecal tonsils and signiﬁcant downregulation in the spleen after Salmonella challenge . 
Therefore , we presume that experimental conditions , such as the age of the animals , bacterial strain , and application dose , may play a critical role in the ﬁnal experimental outcome . 
Expression of the regulatory cytokine TGF - 4 was found after infection , and this may have inhibited inﬂammatory responses . 
The conventional paradigm for inﬂammatory responses is for inverse expression of proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines ( 41 ) , as was observed for in vitro experiments using heterophils isolated from commercial lines of birds that differed in resistance to Salmonella infection ( 43 ) . 
In the present study , decreased expression of IL-1 and CXCLi2 was found in the spleen and cecum at day 5 , and increased expression of TGF - 4 was also found in the same tissues at the same time point , consistent with the role of this cytokine in downregulating inﬂammatory responses . 
The ﬂagella of Salmonella are known to be potent inducers of cytokines . 
Salmonella ﬂagella can induce rapid de novo synthesis of TNF - and IL-1 , followed by IL-6 and IL-10 , by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( 53 ) . 
Bacterial ﬂagellin is the major constituent of the bacterial ﬂagellum ( 34 ) , which can act as an agonist for chicken TLR5 ( 24 ) and stimulates chicken TLR5 cells to upregulate IL-1 , IFN - , and CXCLi2 mRNAs ( 21 , 26 ) . 
Gewirtz et al. ( 18 ) have also reported that ﬂagellin of S. Typhimu-rium is responsible for induction of IL-8 production by intestinal epithelial cells exposed to wild-type organisms . 
In this investigation , the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines ( IL-1 and IFN - ) and chemokines ( CXCLi2 ) induced by recombinant attenuated Salmonella strain KLZ111 were signiﬁcantly higher than those induced by the ﬂhD mutant Salmonella strain KLZ112 in various organs and cells . 
Consistent with these ﬁndings , levels of IL-1 mRNA were increased in the cecal tonsils of chicken challenged with ﬂiM mutant or WT S. Typhimurium , with larger amounts induced by ﬂagellum-intact S. Typhimu-rium . 
Accordingly , the reduced levels of cecal tonsil IL-1 observed after challenge with aﬂagellar S. Typhimurium are consistent with the reduced enteric polymorphonuclear cell inﬁltration ( 21 ) . 
Using live Salmonella , chicken kidney cells ( CKCs ) have been shown to upregulate IL-1 mRNA after exposure to ﬂagellated serovars ( S. Typhimurium , S. Enteritidis , and S. Dublin ) but not aﬂagellate S. Gallinarum ( 22 ) . 
Gewirtz et al. ( 18 ) also showed that an S. Typhimurium ﬂhD mutant failed to induce IL-8 secretion by intestinal epithelial cells but that IL-8 can be induced by the WT strain . 
These results suggested that ﬂagellin is conducive to the innate immune responses triggered by Salmonella . 
However , there was no signiﬁcant difference in IL-6 , IL-12 , and IFN - gene expression in the Peyer 's patches and spleen and liver tissues between mice infected with the WT and Salmonella ﬂhC mutant strains ( 38 ) . 
It was recently shown that the levels of TNF - , IL-1 , and IL-12p70 were signiﬁcantly increased in Peyer 's patches and that IFN - was highly increased in the medial lymph nodes of mice infected with aﬂagellate mutants compared to those treated with the WT strain ( 15 ) . 
Nevertheless , the disparities between the Salmonella strains , organs , or animals used , together with the types of genes analyzed in these studies , make direct comparisons to our ﬁndings difﬁcult . 
In the current study , the levels of TLR5 induced by recombinant attenuated Salmonella strains in the spleens of chickens were decreased at day 3 p.i. and increased dramatically at day 5 p.i. . 
In a previous study , TLR5 mRNA expression in the spleens of Leg-horn , broiler , and Fayoumi chicken lines was consistently decreased after infection with Salmonella , and there was no significant effect of p.i. time on TLR5 expression level in Salmonella-inoculated and mock-inoculated birds ( 2 ) . 
However , Abasht et al. ( 1 ) found that male but not female chickens infected with Salmo-nella showed an increase in the TLR5 RNA expression level in the spleen . 
Thus , there have been contradictory conclusions about the expression of TLR5 in the spleens of Salmonella-immunized chickens . 
The downregulation of TLR5 RNA expression in the spleen after Salmonella infection , as observed in this study , might be beneﬁcial for protection of host cells from overstimulation by bacterial ﬂagellin ( 48 ) . 
Interestingly , the levels of KLZ111-induced IL-1 , CXCLi2 , and IFN - mRNAs were not correlated with the level of TLR5 qRT-PCR product detected in our study . 
In contrast , the levels of TLR5 correlated with the amounts of ﬂagellin-induced IL-1 mRNA in CKC , chicken embryo ﬁbro-blast ( CEF ) , and HD11 cell cultures ( 21 ) , which suggests that there are additional mechanisms responsible for the level of gene expression . 
In summary , we have demonstrated that there were differences in the innate responses induced by attenuated recombinant Sal-monella and an aﬂagellate mutant , which pinpoints a critical role of ﬂagellin in the innate immune system in chickens . 
Recently , the description of TLR5 , which recognizes ﬂagellin and has the capacity to activate innate and adaptive immune responses , has intensiﬁed the testing of ﬂagellins as vaccine adjuvants for the induction of both antibody and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens ( reviewed in reference 32 ) . 
Therefore , future studies will assess the role of ﬂagellin in the adaptive immune responses to F antigen induced by attenuated recombinant Salmonella .
