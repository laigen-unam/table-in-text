Abstract opgB gene of Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium was identiﬁed earlier in a genome-wide screen for mice virulence ( Valentine et al. in Infect Immun 66:3378 -- 3383 , 1998 ) . 
Although mutation in opgB resulted in avirulent Salmonella strain , how this gene contributes to pathogenesis remains unclear . 
Based on DNA homology , opgB is predicted to be responsible for adding phosphoglycerate residues to osmoregulated periplasmic glucans ( OPGs ) giving them anionic characteristics . 
In Escherichia coli , yet another gene , opgC , is also reported to contribute to anionic characteristics of OPGs by adding succinic acid residues . 
We constructed opgB , opgC , and opgBC double mutants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 . 
As predicted opgBC mutant synthesized neutral OPGs that were devoid of any anionic substituents . 
However , opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutations had no signiﬁcant impact on mice virulence as well as on competitive organ colonization . 
In low osmotic conditions , opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants exhibited delay in growth initiation in the presence of sodium deoxycholate . 
Anionic substituents of OPGs from Salmonella although appear to be needed to overcome resistance of deoxycholate in hypoosmotic growth media , no evidence was found for their role in mice virulence .

Introduction
Relatively little is known about how food borne enteric pathogens survive in nutrient deprived and low-osmolarity environments , such as irrigation and vegetable wash waters ( Bhagwat 2006 ) . 
The optimal growth of cells requires that the cytoplasm contains essential constituents with total osmolarity over 300 mosmol l , while vegetable wash -1 waters and irrigation waters osmolarity can be in the range of 80 -- 40 mosmol l ( Kennedy 1996 ) . 
In Escherichia coli , -1 when cells are grown in media with low osmolarity , it has been proposed that the swelling and rupturing of cytoplasmic membrane are prevented by the periplasmic anionic short glucose chains , termed `` osmoregulated periplasmic glucans '' ( OPGs ) ( Kennedy 1996 ; Bohin 2000 ) . 
OPGs are also thought to play an important role in host-microbe interactions involving speciﬁc plant and animal hosts , but the mechanisms are poorly understood ( Bohin and Lacroix 2007 ) . 
We recently demonstrated that OPGs of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 are needed for optimal mice virulence and competitive organ colonization ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ; Liu et al. 2009 ) . 
Interestingly , gene responsible for phosphoglycerate substitutions on OPGs , opgB , was identiﬁed in a genome-wide mutagenesis screen for identiﬁcation of virulence-related genes of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Bowe et al. 1998 ; Valentine et al. 1998 ) . 
In this study , opgB ( mdoB , old nomenclature ) mutant strain CL288 was reported to be attenuated for its mice virulence . 
However , it was not clear what role opgB played in Salmonella path-ogenesis . 
Based on gene homology to E. coli , OPGs of Salmonella are predicted to be substituted with phosphoglycerate and succinate moieties ( function of opgB and opgC genes ) giving them anionic characteristics ( Lacorix et al. 1999 ; Bohin and Lacroix 2007 ) . 
In this study , we examined effect of opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutations in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL 1344 on anionic charges of OPGs and mice virulence .

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
The strains used in this study ( Table 1 ) were grown in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) medium at 37 C in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm . 
When required , the medium was supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations : ampicillin ( 100 lg ml-1 ) , kanamycin and chloramphenicol ( 50 lg ml-1 ) , and nalidixic acid ( 10 lg ml-1 ) . 
Salmonella-Shigella Agar , Brilliant Green Agar ( Difco , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , and Salmonella semiselective indicator media with appropriate antibiotics were used to isolate Salmonella from mice tissue . 
Osmolarity of growth media was measured with Wescor vapor pressure osmometer ( model 5500 , Wescor , Inc. , Logan UT ) .

The growth rates of wild-type and opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants were determined in different growth media such as LB and LB with no salts ( LBNS ) with osmolarity of 407 ± 4 and 85 ± 4 mosmol l , respectively . 
Growth -1 was measured using a Bioscreen C automatic turbidometric analyzer ( GrowthCurves USA , NJ ) as described earlier ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ) . 
Statistical analysis
For statistical analyses , SigmaStat 3.0 software ( Ashburn , VA ) was used . 
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test to determine statistical differences between means of treatments . 
Construction of opgB, C, and BC mutants
opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants were created following lambda-red recombination protocol as described ( Datsenko and Wanner 2000 ; Bhagwat et al. 2009 ) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 . 
To obtain op-gBC mutant , we removed chloramphenicol gene cassette , which was inserted at the site of opgB mutant of SL1344 by lambda-red recombination protocol and obtained strain opgB_scar . 
Using this as a host strain , opgC gene mutation was transferred by P22 transduction . 
All mutants obtained by P22 transduction were conﬁrmed to be phage free and further conﬁrmed by DNA sequence analysis . 
To clone the opgB and opgC genes , DNA region ﬂanking 450 bps upstream and 20 bps downstream region at the opgB and opgC loci from wild-type strain was ampliﬁed using Phusion Fidelity PCR kit ( New England Biolabs , MA ) following manufacturer 's instructions . 
The ampliﬁed DNA fragments were cloned in pGEM-T vector ( Promega Corporation , Inc. , USA ) and then in an arabi-nose-inducible expression vector pBAD322-K ( Cronan 2006 ) to get pLN3 ( opgB ) , pLN4 ( opgC ) , and pLN5 ( op-gBC ) . 
Plasmid constructs were mobilized to opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants by electroporation for complementation studies as described earlier ( Bhagwat et al. 2006 ) . 
Large scale isolation and puriﬁcation of OPGs
To maximize the yield of OPGs , cells were grown in LBNS medium ( 85 ± 4 mosmol l ) , and OPGs were extracted -1 by the charcoal adsorption procedure and were eluted with aqueous pyridine as described ( Lequette et al. 2004 ; Bhagwat et al. 2009 ) . 
Crude OPGs were subjected to gel ﬁltration using a BioGel P-4 ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , USA ) column ( 1.5 cm 9 100 cm ) and eluted at room temperature with 7 % 1-propanol as described ( Bhagwat et al. . 
* 
2009 ) . 
The charged OPGs were further fractionated from total OPGs by ion exchange chromatography using a DEAE-cellulose ( Whatman DE53 , Sigma Chemicals , St. Louise , MO ) column and eluted in a step-wise gradient of 0 and 0.5 M NaCl ( Liu et al. 2010 ) . 
The unbound fraction was referred to as neutral OPGs , and the charged OPGs eluted with 0.5 M NaCl . 
Determination of succinate content from OPGs
Succinate contents from OPGs were estimated using a succinic acid kit ( Roche R-Biopharma AG , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and as described earlier ( Lacorix et al. 1999 ; Liu et al. 2010 ) . 
Mouse virulence studies
Mouse virulence studies were conducted as described earlier ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ; Kannan et al. 2009 ) using ﬁve-week-old male BALB/c mice . 
Mice were acclimated 1 week prior to use , and all animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . 
Animals were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium suspension ( in 50 mM phosphate buffered saline , pH 7.2 ) by intraperitoneal injection . 
Bacterial strains were grown in LB medium at 37 C without shaking for 16 -- 18 h , suspended in phosphate buffered saline , and adjusted to appropriate cell density before infection . 
Viable cell counts from individual dose dilutions were conﬁrmed by retrospective spread plating onto LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics , kanamycin ( 50 lg ml-1 , for plasmid borne complementation ) , and/or chloramphenicol ( 50 lg ml-1 for chromosomal insertion mutations ) and incubated overnight at 37 C. To determine competitive organ occupancy index ( CI ) and cancelled-out index ( COI ) ( Beuzon and Holden 2001 ) for opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants and wild-type strains , groups of mice ( 5 mice per group ) were inoculated and monitored twice daily for signs of morbidity or mortality . 
Two competing strains were mixed in equal proportions and retrospectively conﬁrmed the following day by con-ﬁrming viable cell counts on selective media . 
Five days post-infection , liver from individual animal ( live , dead , or moribund ) was dissected , weighed , and homogenized in LB broth ( Liu et al. 2009 ) . 
Cell counts were determined by spread plating appropriate dilutions onto Salmonella semiselective medium Brilliant green agar plates ( Difco , NJ ) with or without chloramphenicol ( 50 lg ml-1 ) and kanamycin ( 50 lg ml-1 ) . 
Individual colonies were counted after overnight incubation at 37 C , and statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons or the Mann -- Whitney non-paramet-ric test . 
A value of p \ 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant . 
Results and discussion
Anionic characteristics of OPGs from opgB, opgC, and opgBC mutants
Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans from wild-type S. ent-erica serovar Typhimurium strain SL 1344 were obtained as a single major peak from a BioGel P4 gel ﬁltration column ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ) . 
Chromosomal deletion mutations of opgB , opgC , and double-knockout mutant , opgBC , synthesized OPGs that also generated identical pattern upon BioGel P4 column chromatography ( data not shown ) . 
However , when OPGs were further fractionated based on anionic charges on DEAE-cellulose column , signiﬁcant differences were observed . 
Wild-type strain SL1344 as well as opgB and opgC mutants synthesized OPGs that were predominantly anionic with only * 1 % OPGs being neutral and did not bind to DEAE-cellulose column ( Fig. 1 ) . 
With the application of a step gradient ( 0.05 -- 0.5 M ) , OPGs from strain SL1344 could be fractionated in two major peaks eluting at 0.05 and 0.1 M NaCl ( 25 % and 67 % of total OPGs , respectively ) ( Fig. 1a ) . 
In agreement with predicted function of succinylation ( Lacorix et al. 1999 ) , opgC mutant synthesized OPGs that were devoid of succinate residues . 
Succinic acid contents of the total OPGs from opgB mutants were unchanged ( 0.95 ± 0.23 and 0.91 ± 0.11 lmol succinate per lmol of wild-type and opgB OPGs ) . 
Thus , either succinate or phosphoglycerate substitutions were enough to give anionic characteristics to OPGs . 
In agreement with these observations , OPGs synthesized by opgBC mutant were neutral and * 99 % of OPGs did not bind to DEAE-cellulose column ( Fig. 1b ) . 
When wild-type copies of opgB and opgC ( on plasmid , pLN5 ) were mobilized to opgBC mutant , it synthesized anionic OPGs and only 1 % OPGs failed to bind to DEAE-cellulose column , and two major peaks of OPGs were eluted at 0.05 and 0.1 M NaCl step gradient ( Fig. 1 c ) . 
Mobilization of pLN5 also restored succinic acid contents of OPGs ( 1.1 ± 0.19 lmol succinate per lmol of OPGs ) . 
Thus , anionic characteristics of Salmonella OPGs appear to be solely the function of opgB and opgC genes . 
Also succinylation and phosphoglyceration of OPGs appear to take place independent of each other . 
Lack of anionic charges on OPGs generated no phenotypic effect on cell functions such as growth in low osmotic media , motility , and bioﬁlm formation as has been reported for opgGH knockout mutants ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ; Kannan et al. 2009 ; Liu et al. 2009 ) ( data not shown ) . 
These observations indicate that anionic substituents of OPGs do not inﬂuence any signiﬁcant effect on the pleiotropic effects that are observed in other microorganisms defective in OPG synthesis ( Cangelosi et al. 1990 ; Bhagwat et al. 1992 , 1996 ; Bohin 2000 ; Bohin and Lacroix 2007 ) .

Following the observations reported by Bowe et al. 1998 and Valentine et al. ( 1998 ) , we set out to check mice virulence of opgB , opgC , and opgBC mutants of SL1344 . 
Based on earlier studies , we administered intraperitoneal dose of * 100 cells and recorded morbidity at 15 days post-infection ( Table 1 ) . 
Data from two independent experiments indicated no evidence to suggest any signiﬁcant attenuation in mice virulence due to opgB , opgC , or opgBC mutations . 
Mutant strain CL288 as initially reported by Bowe et al. ( 1998 ) was identiﬁed in a genome-wide MudJ-transposon mutagenesis screen , and gene disruption at opgB locus was identiﬁed by partial DNA sequence analysis of the ﬂanking ends of MudJ-transposon . 
This strain was reported to have [ 3-log difference in LD50 levels with reference to its wild-type parent ( ATCC 14028 ) . 
Although LD50 is a useful measure of virulence , this crude method only reﬂects the cumulative effect of all steps involved in causing lethality . 
Hence apparent lack of attenuation in the virulence due to mutations in opgB and opgC genes may not necessarily mean that the genes are not important virulence determinant . 
To this end , we resorted to more sensitive method such as competitive organ colonization in mixed infection ( Baumler et al. 1997 ) . 
Co-inoculated strains Colonization index 
opgB/WT 
CI = 0.189 ± 0.11 COI = 0.347 ± 0.217 CI = 0.211 ± 0.07

Competitive index (CI) and cancelled-out index (COI) measurements of opgB, C, and BC mutants
Baumler et al. ( 1997 ) determined competitive index ( CI ) by infecting mice with equivalent numbers of two strains ( mutant and wild type ) . 
The CI is deﬁned as the ratio between the mutant strain and the wild type in the target organ divided by the ratio of the two strains at the inoculum . 
The CI for opgB and opgC in mixed infections with wild-type strain was [ 0.1 ( Table 1 ) . 
The data suggest that difference if any in organ colonization between opg mutants and wild type are not greater than 1-log magnitude . 
One interpretation of the CI data is the possibility that anionic charges due to either phosphoglycerate or succinate might be sufﬁcient for Salmonella pathogenesis ; however , this is not supported by the virulence characteristics of opgBC strain . 
Additionally , the possibility that also remains to be clariﬁed in CI determination studies is defect in some mutants might be complemented in trans by the wild-type strain ( Table 2 ) . 
To gain insights into some of these possibilities , we took advantage of the modiﬁcation of the CI protocol called as cancelled-out competitive index ( COI ) ( Shea et al. 1999 ; Beuzon and Holden 2001 ) . 
COI is deﬁned as the ratio of the double-mutant to single-mutant strain in target organ , opgBC/opgB COI = 0.297 ± 0.204 
Liver from each animal was obtained 5 days post-infection . 
Competitive index ( CI ) and cancelled-out index ( COI ) were obtained by plating tissue homogenate on Salmonella semiselective medium with appropriate antibiotics . 
Values represent mean with standard deviation of the mean from a single experiment involving ﬁve animals per treatment divided by the ratio of the two strains in the initial inoculum . 
The COI index is a more reliable measure of the functional relationship of the gene since the method detects differences in attenuation between double - and singlemutant strain in the same animal . 
The COI index also eliminates the effect of animal-to-animal variation . 
We observed that COI of opgBC versus opgC ( 0.347 ± 0.217 ) was not statistically different than the corresponding CI of opgB versus wild type ( 0.189 ± 0.11 ) ( p = 0.680 ) . 
Likewise , COI of opgBC versus opgB ( 0.297 ± 0.204 ) was not statistically different than the corresponding CI of opgC versus wild type ( 0.211 ± 0.07 ) ( p = 0.734 ) . 
Thus , it appears that contribution , if any , by opgB and opgC genes toward Salmonella virulence is independent of each other , and presence or absence of one gene does not affect the functionality of the other gene . 
The fact that anionic OPGs are synthesized by both opgB and opgC mutants of Shigella ﬂexneri ( Liu et al. 2010 ) further corroborates the possibility that the two genes function independent of each other . 
Further , either of the anionic charges of Salmonella OPGs were able to provide comparable protection against sodium deoxycholate ( see below ) . 
It is not clear at this point why opgB mutation in SL1344 genetic background failed to generate virulence attenuation in mice as it was reported for strain ATCC 14028 ( Val-entine et al. 1998 ) . 
Strain-dependent variation in bile resistance phenotypes of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has been reported ( Badie et al. 2007 ) . 
However , it may also be noted that in the original study , the phenotype of strain CL288 ( opgB : : MudJ ) was not conﬁrmed by recreating opgB gene-speciﬁc deletion mutant . 
Also restoration of the original phenotype by trans complimenting , plasmid borne wild-type copy of opgB , was not reported ( Valentine et al. 1998 ) . 
Possibly additional mutation ( s ) far from opgB affecting virulence in the opgB : : MudJ strain ( Valentine et al. 1998 ) appears more likely reason for the discrepancy in data of the two studies . 
CI = 0.189 ± 0.11 COI = 0.347 ± 0.217 CI = 0.211 ± 0.07 
opgBC/opgC opgC/WT 
Role of anionic charges on OPGs in overcoming anionic detergent stress has been proposed earlier ( Bohin 2000 ; Bohin and Lacroix 2007 ) . 
Salmonella strains are intrinsically resistant to bile salts that are detergent-like substances secreted by liver . 
Bile salts induce both membrane damage and DNA damage , and several gene families contribute toward bile resistance such as lipopolysaccharide , efﬂux pump , porins , and regulatory genes ( Gunn 2000 ; Ramos-Morales et al. 2003 ; Merritt and Donaldson 2009 ) . 
Most abundant bile salts in humans are cholate and deoxycholate ( DOC ) . 
Due to OPGs prime location in the periplasm , it was hypothesized that anionic charges on OPGs may act as triangle ) , opgB ( ﬁlled circle ) , opgB ( pLN3 ) ( open circle ) , opgBC ( ﬁlled square ) , and opgBC ( pLN5 ) ( open square ) . 
Growth was measured every 20 min by measuring A600 using BioScreen growth chamber as described in the `` Materials and methods '' section repellent and fend off anionic detergents and could be very important during pathogenesis ( Rajagopal et al. 2003 ) . 
Salmonella opgB and opgC mutants did not exhibit DOC sensitivity as it has been reported in previous bilesensitive mutants ( Ramos-Morales et al. 2003 ; Crawford et al. 2008 ) . 
Conﬁrming these studies , we too observed that when grown in regular LB media , opg mutants were able to tolerate DOC and were indistinguishable from wild-type strain SL1344 ( data not shown ) . 
Osmolarity of regular LB broth is 407 ± 4 mosmol l , and negligible amounts of -1 OPGs are synthesized by Salmonella under such conditions ( Bhagwat et al. 2009 ) . 
To this end , we grew cells under nutrient sufﬁcient but low-osmolarity conditions ( 85 ± 4 mosmol l ) and subjected them to DOC stress . 
In -1 the absence of detergent stress , none of the opg mutants were affected by the low osmolarity of LBNS medium and time to enter logarithmic growth phase ( A = 0.5 ) of 600 wild type , and three opg mutants ( i.e. , opgB , opgC , and opgBC ) along with their complemented strains remained indistinguishable ( 431 -- 449 min ) ( Fig. 2a ) . 
Addition of 0.2 % DOC extended the lag time of all strains , and wildtype strain now required 677 ± 18 min to enter logarithmic growth phase ( compared to 437 ± min in the absence of DOC ) ( Fig. 2b ) . 
The onset of logarithmic growth phase in mutants synthesizing OPGs that lacked either succinate ( opgC ) or phosphoglycerate ( opgB ) charges was also extended to 841 ± 11 and 844 ± 16 min ( i.e. , opgC and opgB mutants , respectively ) ( Fig. 2b ) . 
opgBC mutant was most sensitive to DOC and required 980 ± 22 min to enter logarithmic growth phase . 
Plating efﬁciency of opgBC cells did not changed when cells were spotted on LB agar plates with or without 0.2 % DOC ( data not shown ) , indicating lag observed by opgBC mutants could be due to increased adaptation time . 
Mobilization functional opg genes on a low-copy vector restored DOC tolerance of mutants ( Fig. 2b , open symbols ) as well as their anionic characteristics of OPGs ( Fig. 1c ) . 
opg mutants complimented with plasmid constructs ( pLN3 , pLN4 , and pLN5 ) , and wild-type strain grew at comparable rates and entered logarithmic phase ( 655 ± 18 , 667 ± 21 and 695 ± 14 , respectively ) in similar fashion to wild-type strain carrying vector plasmid pBAD322 K ( 677 ± 18 min ) . 
Our results provide ﬁrst genetic evidence that anionic charges on OPGs in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium are solely the function of opgB and opgC genes . 
Further , these anionic substituents of OPGs from Salmonella although appear to be needed to overcome resistance of deoxycho-late in hypoosmotic growth media ; no evidence was found for their role in mice virulence .
