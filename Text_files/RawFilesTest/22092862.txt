Abstract 
The cold acclimatization response in many bacterial species is a tightly regulated process , which ensures the correct folding of macromolecules . 
In entero-bacteria , this response is in part dependent on polynucleotide phosphorylase , which is encoded by the gene pnp . 
Based on transcriptional analysis of the pnp locus of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , we show that pnp and the adjacent membrane lipoprotein nlpI gene form an operon with both genes contributing independently to the cold acclimatization response at 15 °C . 
Our ﬁndings thereby deﬁne a new role for NlpI in bacterial cold acclimatization .

Introduction
Many microorganisms experience wide temperature ﬂuctuations in the natural environment . 
As macromolecular folding strongly relies on temperature , it follows that any shift in temperature places a substantial demand on the cell in terms of the biochemical functionality ( Hurme & Rhen , 1998 ; Klinkert & Narberhaus , 2009 ) . 
Many bacteria have therefore evolved a conserved mechanism for cold acclimatization , which involves the induction of speciﬁc cold shock proteins that permit growth at lower temperatures ( Phadtare et al. , 1999 ) . 
In the enterobacterium Escherichia coli , the sudden transfer from 37 to 15 °C results in a response termed ` cold shock ' that associates with a modulation in RNA turnover ( Phadtare , 2004 ; Phadtare & Severinov , 2010 ) . 
A hallmark of this response is the induction of cold shock proteins ( Csps ) ( Phadtare et al. , 1999 ) . 
The major cold shock protein CspA acts as a RNA chaperone and contains a cold shock domain reminiscent of the S1 RNA binding motif . 
Expression of CspA itself is regulated posttranslationally by temperature-dependent structural alterations in the mRNA encoding CspA ( Giuliodori et al. , 2010 ) . 
In addition to dedicated Csps , the cold acclimatization of E. coli requires components of the RNA degradosome , including the phosphorolytic exoribonuclease polynucleo-tide phosphorylase ( PNPase , pnp ; Beran & Simons , 2001 ; Yamanaka & Inouye , 2001 ) and the proposed alternative cold shock RNA helicase CsdA ( Prud ' homme‐Généreux et al. , 2004 ; Turner et al. , 2007 ) . 
As the cold-restricted growth phenotype of E. coli csdA mutants can be complemented by plasmids encoding other proteins interacting with RNA ( Awano et al. , 2007 ) , it implies that additional bacterial components may participate in the cold shock response . 
The cold shock response is highly conserved amongst bacteria with Csps as well as PNPase also contributing to the cold shock response in other species such as Yersinia and Bacillus ( Palonen et al. , 2010 ) . 
The enteric pathogen 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is closely related to E. coli . 
It is a successful pathogen capable of infecting both warm-blooded and poikilothermic animals including ﬁsh , nematodes , amoebas and plants ( Lewis , 1975 ; Van der Walt et al. , 1997 ; Charkow-ski et al. , 2002 ; Cooley et al. , 2003 ; Tenor et al. , 2004 ; Doyel & Beuchat , 2007 ; Onyango et al. , 2009 ) . 
Hence , S. Typhimurium is also expected to experience wide ﬂuctuations in environmental temperature . 
Both pnp and csdA ( the latter also termed deaD ) are closely linked on the genome of S. Typhimurium and only separated by nlpI that encodes for a membrane lipoprotein ( Blattner et al. , 1997 ; Ohara et al. , 1999 ; McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Parkhill et al. , 2001 ; Nie et al. , 2006 ) . 
We have previously shown that pnp and nlpI have opposing effects on bioﬁlm formation at decreased growth temperatures with PNPase and NlpI , respectively , enhancing and suppressing bioﬁlm formation ( Rouf et al. , 2011 ) . 
As nlpI is positioned between pnp and csdA , we have here investigated the contribution of pnp , nlpI and csdA ( the latter hereafter referred to as deaD ) in the cold accli-matization response in S. Typhimurium . 
Our data show that pnp and nlpI constitute an operon that is transcriptionally separate from deaD and that PNPase , NlpI and DeaD individually contribute to the growth of S. Typhimurium at 15 °C . 
Our ﬁndings thereby deﬁne a new role for NlpI in bacterial cold acclimatization .

Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1 . 
Bacteria were grown in Luria -- Bertani medium ( LB ) . 
Antibiotics ( Sigma ) were used where appropriate including ampicillin , 100 lg mL 1 ; chloramphenicol , 10 lg mL 1 ; kanamycin , 30 lg mL 1 ; and tetracycline , 10 lg mL 1 . 
For induction of recombinant NlpI , media were supplemented with 0.1 % L ( + ) - Arabinose ( Sigma ) . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SR-11 mutants ( Δpnp , ΔnlpI and ΔdeaD ) were created by the one-step gene inactivation technique described previously 
( Datsenko & Wanner , 2000 ; Rouf et al. , 2011 ) . 
Mutated genes were transferred into S. Typhimurium SR-11 by phage P22 int transduction from S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 background ( Schmieger , 1972 ) . 
The pnp -- nlpI double mutant was constructed in succession . 
First , the PCR-ampliﬁed tetracycline resistance gene from pACYC184 was cloned into the KpnI site at codon 201 of pnp in vector pSU41 . 
Then , the pnp : : tet mutation was cloned into the pCVD442 suicide plasmid ( Donnenberg & Kaper , 1991 ) and introduced into S. Typhimurium SR-11 . 
The 
* Nonsense codon at the beginning of RNA binding domain of the pnp reading frame . 
integrated vector was excised through sucrose selection to generate the pnp * mutant strain MC55 . 
The nlpI : : kan mutation was transferred into MC55 through P22 int phage transduction to generate pnp -- nlpI double mutant strain SFR394 . 
All mutants constructed were veriﬁed by qRT-PCR , and all pnp mutations were further veriﬁed by immunoblotting . 
Immunoblot assay
Immunoblotting of SDS -- PAGE gels was performed as outlined in QIAexpress Detection Assay Handbook ® ( Qiagen ) using polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes ( HybondTM P ; Amersham ) . 
A polyclonal rabbit anti-PNPase serum , generated by immunizing rabbits with puriﬁed PNPase ( Clements et al. , 2002 ) under the ethical permit Dnr 79/2001 , was used as primary antibody ( 1 : 500 ) , whilst horseradish peroxidase -- conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG ( 1 : 5000 , Pierce ) was applied as second-ary antibody . 
Blots were analysed using SuperSignal detection kit ( Pierce ) and ChemiDoc XRS system ( BioRad ) .

RNA extraction and reverse PCR
For extraction of RNA , bacteria were grown in LB to the exponential phase of growth . 
Total bacterial RNA was isolated using the TRI Reagent ( Sigma ) . 
To determine transcripts spanning the pnp -- nlpI and nlpI -- deaD genes , RNA samples were ﬁrst reverse-transcribed using the M-MLV kit ( Invitrogen ) . 
Standard PCR was then carried out on the cDNA products using different sets of primers ( Supporting Information , Table S1 ) . 
Total genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation kit ( Promega ) and used as a positive template control . 
DNA fragments were analysed on ethidium bromide -- 
stained agarose gels . 
RNA quantiﬁcation was carried out by quantitative reverse PCR using the SYBR Green JumpStart kit ( Sigma ) and the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system with primers detailed in Table S1 . 
Cold acclimatization assays
The ability to sustain sudden drop in growth temperature was assayed in two ways . 
First , bacteria were grown in LB to the exponential phase of growth at 37 °C . 
From that , 100 lL of the culture was adjusted to an OD600 nm of 0.5 , which then was inoculated into 50 mL of precooled LB on a shaker at 15 °C . 
Optical densities of the cultures were then followed at regular time intervals . 
In the second assay , bacteria were grown over night in LB at 37 °C and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to an OD600 nm of 0.5 . 
Subsequent 1 : 10 serial dilutions were then inoculated in 10 lL drops on two separate LB agar plates . 
One was incubated at 37 °C and the other at 15 °C .

Genetic characterization of the pnp–nlpI–deaD region
In S. Typhimurium , pnp and nlpI are linked and read from the same DNA strand ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
The pnp STOP codon and the nlpI START codons are separated by 109 nucleotides ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Fig. 1a ) . 
Because of the close proximity of pnp to nlpI , we expression of nlpI . 
We compared the pnp and nlpI mRNA levels in the wild-type S. Typhimurium SR-11 ( MC1 ) and three pnp mutants . 
These mutants were MC71 ( pnp ) expressing a truncated PNPase because of a point mutation replacing codon 600 with stop codon TAA and mutant SFR228 ( Δpnp ) having the entire pnp open reading frame deleted ( Fig. 1a ) ( Clements et al. , 2002 ; Rouf et al. , 2011 ) . 
A third mutant MC55 ( pnp * ) contained a tetracycline resistance gene ( derived from cloning vector pACYC184 ) inserted at codon 201 of pnp and the resistance gene promoter reading from the same strand as pnp and nlpI ( Fig. 1a ) . 
The Δpnp and pnp * mutants failed to provide any signal upon immunoblotting bacterial cell lysates for PNPase , whereas pnp mutant revealed an expected truncated variant of PNPase ( Fig. 1b ) . 
The levels of pnp and nlpI mRNAs in the wild type and mutant strains were quantiﬁed by qRT-PCR from cultures grown to the exponential phase of growth in Luria broth ( LB ) . 
The primers used were designed to probe the pnp mRNA downstream of codon 201 and did not overlap with codon 600 of pnp . 
Compared to the wild-type strain , we detected enhanced expression of pnp mRNA in the pnp point mutant pnp and no signiﬁcant pnp mRNA signals in the pnp deletion mutant Δpnp ( Fig. 2a ) . 
Expression of nlpI was elevated ( > 2-fold ) in the pnp mutants pnp and Δpnp as compared to the wild-type strain ( Fig. 2a ) . 
For the pnp insertion mutant pnp * , we noted 
LT2 genome sequence ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
( b ) Expression of PNPase as determined by immunoblotting from the wild-type strain ( lane 1 ) , pnp lacking the S1 domain ( lane 2 ) , Δpnp lacking pnp ( lane 3 ) , ΔnlpI lacking nlpI ( lane 4 ) , the pnp -- nlpI double mutant ( lane 5 ) , no apparent alteration in either the pnp or nlpI mRNA signals ( Fig. 2a ) . 
Conversely , no alteration in pnp expression was observed when nlpI was deleted in mutant SFR319 ( ΔnlpI ) ( Fig. 2a ) . 
Combined , these observations demonstrate that the expression of nlpI is increased by mutations in pnp . 
However , this increase was not observed in pnp * mutant presumably because of nlpI expression being driven from the tetracycline resistance gene promoter in pnp * . 
This assumption would also explain detection of pnp mRNA in the pnp * mutant . 
To deﬁne whether the pnp -- nlpI genes are transcribed as single mRNA , total bacterial RNA was ﬁrst reversetranscribed from wild-type S. Typhimurium . 
Standard PCR was performed using primer pairs aimed to amplify regions spanning from pnp into nlpI ( Fig. 3a -- c , Table S1 ) . 
When combined with primers at different positions within pnp , and with a primer positioned at the 5 ′ - end of the nlpI open reading frame ( Table S1 ) , the predicted 2.2 kb , 1 kb and 150 bp intergenic fragments were ampli-ﬁed from cDNA prepared from the wild-type strain MC1 ( Fig. 3a -- c ) . 
These observations strongly suggest that pnp and nlpI form an operon . 
As pnp is autoregulated by PNPase ( Carzaniga et al. , 2009 ) , a pnp -- nlpI operon structure would also explain the enhanced nlpI expression noted for the pnp and Δpnp mutants . 
The open reading frame for the tentative cold shock RNA helicase DeaD starts 237 bp downstream the nlpI STOP codon ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) . 
RT-PCR , using mRNA from wild-type S. Typhimurium as template and primers positioned within the deaD coding region , clearly detected deaD transcripts . 
However , using the same template , we failed to amplify any cDNA with primers positioned between the nlpI reading frame and deaD

( Fig. 3d ) . 
Furthermore , as compared to the wild type , the levels of deaD mRNA remained fairly unaltered in the pnp mutant Δpnp and ΔnlpI mutant ( Fig. 2a ) . 
This suggests that deaD is transcribed independently from pnp and nlpI . 
Mutational inactivation of either pnp , nlpI or 
deaD results in impaired growth at 15 °C 
The ability of the pnp , nlpI and deaD mutants to acclimatize and grow when shifted from 37 to 15 °C was determined in broth culture . 
In this assay , all the three pnp mutants revealed a comparable retardation in growth 
( Fig. 3d ) . 
Furthermore , as compared to the wild type , the levels of deaD mRNA remained fairly unaltered in the pnp mutant Δpnp and ΔnlpI mutant ( Fig. 2a ) . 
This suggests that deaD is transcribed independently from pnp and nlpI .

A second cold acclimatization assay was performed comparing growth on Luria agar plates incubated at either 15 or 37 °C . 
The Δpnp , ΔnlpI and pnp -- nlpI double mutants were assayed , and the results were comparable to the broth assay at 15 °C ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . 
The Δpnp and ΔnlpI mutants both showed a restricted recovery when transferred to 15 °C ( Fig. 5 ) . 
In this assay , the growth defect of the pnp -- nlpI double mutant appeared more pronounced in relation to either of the single mutants or nlpI genes ( Fig. 5 ) . 
However , to restore any signiﬁcant growth in the pnp -- nlpI double mutant , plasmids coding for both pnp and nlpI had to be introduced ( Fig. 5 ) . 
The contribution of the deaD gene to the cold acclimation response was also determined by observing the growth of mutant SFR456 ( ΔdeaD ) in both the broth and plate assays . 
The mutant revealed a marked growth defect at 15 °C ( Figs 4d and 5 ) , but this growth defect was , however , not complemented by either pnp or nlpI . 
( Fig. 4a ) . 
As the expression of nlpI was not diminished in any of the three pnp mutants ( Fig. 2a ) , the impaired cold acclimatization could not originate from nlpI , and so in subsequent experiments , we only used the Δpnp mutant ( SFR228 ) . 
The ΔnlpI mutant also showed a reduced ability to grow at 15 °C comparable to the pnp mutants ( Fig. 4a ) . 
As pnp expression was unaffected in this mutant , it infers that pnp and nlpI contribute individually to growth of S. Typhimurium at 15 °C . 
Further evidence to support this view was the observed slower growth for the pnp -- nlpI double mutant ( SFR394 ) ( Fig. 4a ) . 
Complementation of pnp ( pMC109 ) or nlpI ( pSFR04 ) in the respective single mutants almost restored normal growth at 15 °C ( Fig. 4b ) . 
However , the introduction of either pMC109 or pSFR04 into the pnp -- nlpI double mutant resulted in only a partial restoration of growth at 15 °C . 
An almost complete restoration of growth was achieved when the pnp -- nlpI double mutant was comple ¬ 
Discussion
Altered folding as well as a controlled degradation and stabilization of ribonucleic acids constitutes important elements of bacterial adaptation to altered temperatures ( Hurme & Rhen , 1998 ; Giuliodori et al. , 2010 ) . 
Such alterations also include helicases , RNA chaperons and ribonucleases ( Phadtare & Severinov , 2010 ) . 
Alterations in RNA folding may furthermore act as an endogenous post-transcriptional control of gene expression ( Beran & Simons , 2001 ; Giuliodori et al. , 2010 ) . 
Expression and post-transcriptional regulation of PNPase have been thoroughly detailed in E. coli and serve as a model for temperature-associated post-translational gene regulation . 
Transcription of E. coli pnp is initiated from two promoters . 
The ﬁrst directs expression of the immediate upstream gene rpsO , and the second is positioned in the rpsO-pnp intergenic region ( Portiers & Reginer , 1984 ) . 
Irrespective of the transcriptional start site , the pnp mRNA is vulnerable to cleavage by endoribonuclease RNase III at positions within 75 nucleo-tides upstream the pnp ORF , which in turn initiates degradation of the pnp mRNA by PNPase itself ( Portier et al. , 1987 ) . 
Upon a cold shock , the pnp mRNA becomes stabilized allowing enhanced expression of PNPase ( Beran & Simons , 2001 ) . 
In enterobacteria , pnp is followed by nlpI ( Blattner et al. , 1997 ; McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Nie et al. , 2006 ) . 
For E. coli , NlpI has been shown to be a lipoprotein ( Ohara et al. , 1999 ) . 
We recently demonstrated that PNPase and NlpI posed opposing effect on bioﬁlm formation in S. Typhimurium at decreased growth temperature ( Rouf et al. , 2011 ) . 
Experiments that followed here demonstrate that mutational inactivation of pnp in S. Typhimurium results in an expected restricted growth at 15 °C . 
In addition , the experiments showed that pnp transcripts continued into nlpI and that nonpolar pnp mutations increased nlpI expression . 
Although S. Typhimurium pnp and nlpI are separated by 109 base pairs , the promoter prediction software BPROM ( www.Softberry.com ) failed to deﬁne any tentative nlpI promoter within this intergenic region ( data not shown ) . 
Combined with the gene expression analysis , this strongly suggests that pnp and nlpI form an operon and implies that nlpI is subject to the same post-transla-tional regulation of pnp . 
However , we can not formally exclude potential nlpI promoters within pnp . 
The co-transcription of pnp and nlpI led us to detail whether , and to what extent , NlpI contributed to cold acclimatization . 
The data presented in this study demonstrate that nlpI does indeed functionally act as a cold shock gene in concert with , but independently of , pnp . 
Evidence to support includes the observation that two of the three pnp mutants applied in this study had enhanced expression of nlpI , whilst the third had unaffected nlpI mRNA levels compared to the wild type , yet all three mutants showed a very similar defect for growth at 15 °C . 
In addition , a pnp -- nlpI double mutant had more restricted growth at 15 °C compared to either single mutant , whilst cloned pnp and nlpI enhanced the replication of all the respective mutants at 15 °C ( Figs 4b and 5 ) . 
The nlpI gene is adjacent to csdA/deaD in the genomes of enterobacteria ( Blattner et al. , 1997 ; McClelland et al. , 2001 ; Nie et al. , 2006 ) . 
The csdA gene encodes for an alternative RNA helicase that in E. coli also contributes to cold acclimatization ( Turner et al. , 2007 ) . 
In S. Typhimu-rium , the homologue for csdA is deﬁned as deaD . 
Deleting deaD in S. Typhimurium resulted in a cold-sensitive growth phenotype . 
However , we could not trans-comple-ment the cold-restricted growth of the deaD mutant phenotype with either pnp or nlpI . 
This demonstrates speciﬁcity of the complementation by either pnp or nlpI . 
We also could not detect transcripts spanning the nlpI and deaD reading frames , whilst the promoter prediction software BPROM was able to identify a promoter region in the region separating nlpI from deaD with a high predicted probability ( data not shown ) , suggesting that they are transcribed separately . 
To summarize , our observations imply that pnp and nlpI form a transcriptionally linked region , followed by deaD , and that all three genes individually contribute to cold acclimatization in S. Typhimurium . 
Furthermore , our results showed that apart from dedicated gene regulatory circuits and chaperones , cold acclimatization in S. Typhimurium also signiﬁcantly relies on an outer membrane protein NlpI .

( Fig. 4a ) . 
As the expression of nlpI was not diminished in any of the three pnp mutants ( Fig. 2a ) , the impaired cold acclimatization could not originate from nlpI , and so in subsequent experiments , we only used the Δpnp mutant ( SFR228 ) . 
The ΔnlpI mutant also showed a reduced ability to grow at 15 °C comparable to the pnp mutants ( Fig. 4a ) . 
As pnp expression was unaffected in this mutant , it infers that pnp and nlpI contribute individually to growth of S. Typhimurium at 15 °C . 
Further evidence to support this view was the observed slower growth for the pnp -- nlpI double mutant ( SFR394 ) ( Fig. 4a ) . 
Complementation of pnp ( pMC109 ) or nlpI ( pSFR04 ) in the respective single mutants almost restored normal growth at 15 °C ( Fig. 4b ) . 
However , the introduction of either pMC109 or pSFR04 into the pnp -- nlpI double mutant resulted in only a partial restoration of growth at 15 °C . 
An almost complete restoration of growth was achieved when the pnp -- nlpI double mutant was comple ¬ 
mented with both nlpI and pnp ( Fig. 4c ) . 
( Fig. 5 ) . 
Similar to the broth assay , we also observed a restoration of growth when single mutants were complemented with the plasmids expressing the respective pnp
