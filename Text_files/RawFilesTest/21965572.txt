In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , a bioﬁlm mode of growth known as the rdar morphotype is regulated by several networks which sense multiple environmental signals . 
The transcriptional regulator CsgD is the major target for these regulatory pathways . 
In this study , we show that two lytic transglycosylases of family I , MltE and MltC , in combination increase CsgD expression and rdar morphotype . 
MltE and MltC , which share a highly similar transglycosylase SLT domain , work redundantly to regulate CsgD at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
The effect of MltE and MltC on CsgD levels was independent of the known regulatory pathways that sense cell envelope stress . 
These ﬁndings reveal , for the ﬁrst time , a speciﬁc function of lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium and suggest the existence of a new signaling pathway that links cell wall turnover to bioﬁlm formation . 
Bioﬁlm formation is the most common mode of growth of bacteria . 
The food-borne gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) establishes bioﬁlms on a variety of surfaces , such as those of plants , the eukaryotic host , industrial equipment , and medical supplies . 
Under laboratory conditions , S. Typhimurium bioﬁlms are manifested as a distinct colony morphotype on Congo red agar plates , named rdar , due to the red dry and rough colony appearance . 
This form of bioﬁlm is characterized by the expression of cellulose and curli ﬁmbriae , two major extracellular matrix components in S. Typhimurium ( 7 , 44 , 56 , 64 ) . 
The transcriptional regulator CsgD is the major regulator of the rdar morphotype ( 11 , 48 ) . 
CsgD positively regulates the transcription of the csgBAC operon , which encodes the structural subunits for curli ﬁmbriae ( 18 , 49 ) , and contributes indirectly to cellulose production by activating the transcription of adrA ( 48 , 63 ) . 
AdrA is a diguanylate cyclase that synthesizes the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP ( c-di-GMP ) , the effector molecule that binds to and allosterically activates cellulose synthase ( 55 , 64 ) . 
CsgD expression integrates many environmental signals . 
Several diverse proteins bind to the csgD promoter , including the stress sigma factor RpoS and the response regulator OmpR ( 11 , 12 , 39 , 45 ) . 
In addition , CsgD is regulated by the second messenger c-di-GMP at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels ( 29 ) . 
Two redundant small RNAs , OmrA and OmrB , control CsgD expression on a posttranscriptional level , although their effect is not pronounced under growth on

petri plates ( 21 ) . 
The regulation of the rdar morphotype therefore integrates a variety of complex regulatory systems . 
Lytic transglycosylases are a class of ubiquitous bacterial enzymes involved in the turnover of the bacterial cell wall constituent peptidoglycan ( PG ) . 
Lytic transglycosylases cata-lyze the cleavage of the -1,4 - glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine with anhydromuropeptide monomers as products ( 23 ) . 
Escherichia coli harbors seven lytic transglycosylases , the soluble Slt70 and six outer membrane-anchored lipoproteins , MltA to MltF ( 52 ) . 
Lytic transglycosylases have redundant functions . 
Although Slt is the principal lytic transglycosylase responsible for the turn-over of PG ( 41 ) , the deletion of as many as six lytic transglycosylases is required for an observable effect on cell morphology and the cleavage of the PG septum ( 19 ) . 
Four different families of lytic transglycosylases can be distinguished ( 4 ) . 
However , due to functional redundancy , the correlation of function with family assignment is limited . 
Lytic transglycosylases are involved in the biosynthesis and recycling of the PG sacculus during cell growth and division , as well as in the insertion of macromolecular complexes spanning the cell wall ( 22 , 30 , 52 ) . 
In E. coli , half of the cell wall is broken down in one generation ( 15 ) . 
The anhydromuropeptide monomers formed as a result of PG hydrolysis are reused directly or transported into the cytoplasm through the permease AmpG ( 34 ) . 
In the cytoplasm , the PG degradation products have a signaling function in the regulatory network sensing cell wall turnover ( 26 , 27 ) . 
Together with other PG degrading enzymes , lytic transglycosylases separate daughter cells through the cleavage of the septum during cell division ( 19 ) . 
Lytic transglycosylases also hydrolyze PG to make space for the insertion of macromolecular complexes , e.g. , type III secretion systems , ﬂagella , and pili ( 40 , 62 ) . 
In addition to these functions , lytic transglycosylases contribute to bacterium-host interaction , because anhydromuro-peptide monomers are recognized by eukaryotic pattern rec-ognition receptors ( 13 , 60 ) . 
Bacteria as diverse as Bordetella pertussis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and Vibrio ﬁscheri release signiﬁcant amounts of anhydromuropeptides , which are required for both virulence and symbiosis ( 14 , 31 , 37 ) . 
In this study , we show that two of seven family I lytic transglycosylases from S. Typhimurium , MltE and MltC , are spe-ciﬁcally involved in the regulation of bioﬁlm formation by affecting the expression of the master bioﬁlm regulator CsgD .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatic analysis . 
A search with the MltE protein sequence using BLAST ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) at NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm . 
nih.gov / ) with standard parameters was done to identify lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium . 
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX 2.0.12 software ( 57 ) . 
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Dendroscope software ( 25 ) . 
The domain architecture was analyzed using the Pfam database ( 10 ) . 
Strains , plasmids , and growth conditions . 
Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material . 
The MAE52 strain differs from the wild-type UMR1 by a single point mutation in the csgD promoter , resulting in semiconstitutive , temperature-independent CsgD and rdar morphotype expression . 
In this strain , csgD expression is independent of RpoS ( 49 ) . 
For rdar morphotype analysis , strains were grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium without salt or on LB without salt agar . 
If required , antibiotics and inducers were added at the following concentrations : chloramphenicol ( 20 g ml 1 ) , ampicillin ( 100 g ml 1 ) , and 0.1 % arabinose . 
For cloning purposes , Escherichia coli and S. Typhimurium were grown on LB and LB agar plates supplemented with antibiotics . 
Construction of strains and plasmids . 
The deletion of genes was performed by one-step gene inactivation as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 8 ) . 
A chlor-amphenicol resistance marker replaced the gene of interest with the exclusion of the ﬁrst and last 40 bp . 
Phage transduction was carried out using phage P22 HT105/1 int-201 ( 53 ) . 
Mutant alleles were veriﬁed by PCR with control primers located up - and downstream of the targeted open reading frame ( ORF ) ( see Table S2 in the supplemental material ) . 
In general , the genes were cloned with a C-terminal 6 His tag in the vector pBAD30 . 
mltE and mltC with a glutamic acid-to-glutamine replacement at positions 64 and 219 were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using overlapping primers containing the mutations and subsequently cloned into pBAD30 ( 17 ) , resulting in pCPM14 and pCPM15 . 
To construct plasmids for protein puriﬁcation , DNA fragments of the transglycosylase SLT domains of S. Typhi-murium MltE and MltC proteins ( wild-type and mutants ) were cloned into vector pMAL-c2x ( NEB ) in frame with the maltose-binding protein ( MBP ) . 
The MltE protein contained residues 34 to 202 , and the MltC protein contained residues 189 to 325 . 
All recombinant plasmids were conﬁrmed by sequencing . 
The primers used to construct and sequence the plasmids are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material . 
Phenotypic evaluation of rdar morphotype formation . 
To detect curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose production , the colony morphology phenotype was assessed on Congo red agar plates using the spot test . 
Strains were precultured on LB agar plates at 37 °C for approximately 16 h. Cells were suspended in LB medium and adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 3 . 
Five microliters of the suspension was spotted on LB without salt agar plates supplemented with Congo red ( 40 g ml 1 ) and Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 ( 20 g ml 1 ) . 
The phenotype was observed after 24 h , if not otherwise indicated . 
Western blot analysis . 
Bacteria were grown on LB without salt agar plates at 28 °C for 17 h. Five mg ( wet weight ) cells was harvested , resuspended in 200 l sample buffer , and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min . 
The total protein content was analyzed by Coomassie blue staining after gel separation . 
Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE ( 12 % resolving gel and 4 % stacking gel ) and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane ( Immobilon P ; Millipore ) . 
Detection of CsgD was carried out as described previously ( 48 ) using a polyclonal anti-CsgD peptide antibody ( 1:5,000 ) and horseradish peroxidase-conju-gated goat anti-rabbit IgG ( 1:2,000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. ) . 
His tag was detected with a monoclonal penta-His antibody ( 1:2,000 ; Qiagen ) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG ( 1:10,000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. ) . 
Chemiluminescence ( Lumi-Light WB substrate ; Roche ) was recorded using the Las-1000 system ( Fuji Film ) and quantiﬁed with ImageJ software ( http://rsb . 
info.nih.gov / ij / ) . 
CsgA detection . 
CsgA was detected after an enrichment procedure ( 46 ) . 
Bacteria were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 17 h. Three mg of bacteria was harvested and resuspended in 1.5 ml TE ( 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7.5 ) with 2 % SDS , followed by an incubation at 95 °C for 45 min . 
Afterwards the sample was centrifuged , and the pellet washed with water and ﬁnally resuspended in 30 l water . 
The suspension was lyophilized and the pellet dissolved in 20 l formic acid to depolymerize curli ﬁmbriae . 
After the removal of the formic acid , the CsgA-enriched pellet was resuspended in 20 l SDS sample buffer and 7 l was loaded on the gel ( 15 % separating gel with a 4 % stacking gel , with a double concentration of buffer in the separation gel and running buffer ) . 
After the run , CsgA was visualized by staining the gel with colloidal Coomassie . 
RNA extraction , cDNA synthesis , and quantitative real-time reverse tran-scription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) . 
Bacteria were grown on LB without salt agar plates at 28 °C for 17 h and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after harvest . 
The extraction of total RNA was performed using the SV total RNA isolation system ( Promega ) with minor modiﬁcations ( 16 ) . 
The quality of RNA samples was assessed by gel electrophoresis , and RNA concentrations were determined using the NanoDrop System ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . 
cDNA synthesis from total RNA was performed with the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit ( Applied Bio-systems ) by following the manufacturer 's instructions . 
The expression of the genes of interest was determined by two-step real-time RT-PCR using the power SYBR green PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and the 7500 real-time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
Relative transcript CT abundance was determined with the 2 method using 7500 SDS software , v1 .3.1 ( Applied Biosystems ) . 
The rpsV gene was used as an endogenous control for internal normalization . 
Experiments were performed as biological triplicates using the mean expression from quadruplicates per real-time PCR assay relative to a calibrator value ( UMR1 ) . 
Zymogram analysis . 
The MBP-MltE and MBP-MltC fusions were expressed in E. coli DH5 . 
The proteins were induced at an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.6 using 0.5 mM isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 3 h . 
The proteins were partially puriﬁed from the cell extracts using afﬁnity chromatography on amylose resin by following the manufacturer 's protocol ( NEB ) . 
Cell wall hydrolytic activities were detected after the separation of the wholecell protein extracts , or partially puriﬁed MBP-MltE and MBP-MltC proteins , using 12 % denaturing SDS-PAGE according to the method reported previously ( 3 , 32 ) . 
Brieﬂy , the samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) and resolved by 12 % SDS-PAGE containing 0.6 % ( wt/vol ) lyophilized cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) . 
After PAGE , the gel was brieﬂy rinsed with water and renaturation buffer ( 25 mM sodium phosphate , 10 mM MgCl2 , and 0.1 % Triton X-100 ) with gentle agitation at room temperature . 
The gel was incubated overnight in 500 ml of renaturation buffer at 30 °C followed by an incubation for 24 h at 37 °C . 
The cell wall material in the gel was stained with 0.1 % methylene blue in 0.01 % KOH . 
The gel subsequently was destained with water until unstained autolytic bands appeared on the blue background ( 32 ) . 
Microscopy . 
To perform light and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , strains were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 24 h. For TEM , cells were harvested , ﬁxed using 2 % glutaraldehyde , and resuspended in phos-phate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . 
TEM was performed by the electron microscopy unit ( EMil ) of the Karolinska Institutet . 
RESULTS
Lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium . 
The c-di-GMP-binding protein YcgR is involved in the transition of motile cells to sessility at high intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations ( 5 , 42 , 51 ) . 
In several enterobacterial species , including S. Typhimurium , E. coli , Shigella , Klebsiella , and Erwinia , the ycgR and mltE genes are located next to each other and are transcribed in opposite directions . 
To investigate a potential link between MltE and c-di-GMP metabolism or c-di-GMP-con-trolled functions , we investigated the impact of mltE coding for a family I lytic transglycosylase on bioﬁlm formation ( rdar morphotype expression ) in S. Typhimurium . 
The mltE deletion mutant did not show a change in rdar morphotype expression compared to its expression in the S 
Typhimurium wild-type UMR1 ( Fig. 1A ) . 
On the other hand , the overexpression of MltE from a plasmid led to an upregulated rdar morphotype after 17 h , and upon extended incubation it manifested as an extended matrix structure on Congo red agar plates ( Fig. 1B ) . 
It is important to note that the overexpression of MltE did not result in the retardation of growth or cell lysis ( data not shown ) . 
To investigate whether the lack of the phenotype of the mltE mutant was due to functional redundancy among lytic transglycosylases , we deleted genes encoding family I lytic transglycosylases in the wild-type , UMR1 , and mltE genetic backgrounds . 
A homology search identiﬁed seven lytic transglycosylases belonging to family I in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Six single deletion mutants ( mltE , mltC , PSLT072 , STM4217 , mltD , and slt mutants ) , excluding the most distantly related yfhD ( mltF ) mutant , were investigated and showed no change in rdar morphotype expression ( data not shown ) . 
The analysis of all possible double mutants , however , revealed a signiﬁcant downregulation of the rdar morphotype in the mltE mltC double mutant , which manifested as a white and smooth colony appearance after 24 h of growth ( Fig. 1A ) . 
We also overexpressed the remaining ﬁve lytic transglycosylases individually ( mltC , PSLT072 , STM4217 , mltD , and slt ) , but rdar morphotype expression was not altered compared to that of the wild type ( data not shown ) . 
These results demonstrate a speciﬁc involvement of MltE and MltC in rdar morphotype expression . 
MltE and MltC have different domain structures . 
While MltE contains only the transglycosylase SLT domain , MltC is composed of two domains , the domain of unknown function , DUF3393 , at the N terminus and the SLT domain at the C terminus ( Fig. 2C ) . 
The SLT domains of MltE and MltC share 38 % identity , which is the highest identity between transglycosylase SLT domains in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2A and B ) . 
Therefore , it is possible that the close phylogenetic relationship between the SLT domains of MltE and MltC is the basis for their apparent functional redundancy in rdar morphotype expression . 
MltE and MltC regulate expression of the extracellular matrix components through CsgD . 
To gain insight into the mechanism responsible for the effect of MltE and MltC on bioﬁlm formation , we measured expression levels of the master transcriptional activator CsgD and the levels of one of the main matrix components , curli ﬁmbriae . 
The expression of curli ﬁmbriae was monitored by the assessment of the amount of mo-nomeric CsgA , the structural subunit released following formic acid-mediated ﬁmbriae depolymerization . 
The mltE or mltC single mutant showed no differences from the wild-type UMR1 , while the mltE mltC double mutant showed a clear reduction in CsgD and CsgA protein levels ( Fig. 1C ) . 
CsgD expression levels were reduced to approximately 30 % in the mltE mltC double mutant compared to that of wild-type UMR1 . 
To investigate at which level MltE and MltC regulate CsgD expression , the csgD mRNA levels were determined by realtime RT-PCR ( Fig. 3A ) . 
The csgD mRNA levels in the mltE mltC double mutant were about 47 % of the levels of the wild type . 
Therefore , MltE and MltC appear to regulate CsgD expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
When MltE was expressed from a plasmid in the mltE mltC double mutant , the csgD mRNA levels were restored to wild-type levels ( Fig. 3A ) . 
Also , rdar morphotype expression and CsgD and CsgA protein levels reached or exceeded wildtype levels in the mltE mltC double mutant upon the overexpression of MltE but not MltC ( Fig. 3B and C and data not shown ) . 
An investigation of the level of MltC expression revealed that MltC is expressed at signiﬁcantly lower levels than MltE despite the fact that they had identical promoters and ribosome-binding sites ( data not shown ) . 
Low MltC from plasmid expression may be responsible for the lack of restoration of rdar morphotype expression . 
The catalytic activities of MltE and MltC are responsible for the effect on the rdar morphotype . 
To investigate whether the transglycosylase activities of MltE and MltC were required for rdar morphotype expression , we constructed point mutations in both proteins that were expected to decrease or abolish their activities . 
Lytic transglycosylases of family I share a conserved E-S motif ( 4 ) , where the glutamyl residue is directly involved in catalysis ( 58 ) . 
We replaced the glutamyl residues in the E-S motif with glutamines ( E653Q in MltE and E2193Q i

When the mutant MltE and MltC proteins were expressed from plasmids ( pCPM14 and pCPM15 , respectively ) , they could not restore the rdar morphotype in the mltE mltC double mutant ( Fig. 4A and data not shown ) . 
Interestingly , the overexpression of MltEE65Q resulted in a mucoid phenotype ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that the expression of the protein lacking the catalytic activity imposed envelope stress ( 35 , 36 ) .

Complementation of the S. Typhimurium UMR1 mltE mltC double mutant by MltE . 
( A ) Expression of csgD in the wild-type S. Typhimurium UMR1 and the mltE mltC double mutant was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR .

A decrease in csgD mRNA levels in the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant also was observed . 
The strain UMR1 ompR was used as a negative control ( 45 ) . 
Bacteria were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 17 h . 
The experiment was performed with three biological replicates , using the mean expression values from four technical replicates .

The expression of MltE strongly increases the amount of CsgD and CsgA in the double mutant , while MltC expression leads to the minor upregulation of CsgD and CsgA . 
The relative protein levels compared to that of S. Typhimurium UMR1 , which was set at 100 % , are indicated . 
VC , vector control pBad30 . 
The strains UMR1 csgD and UMR1 csgA were used as negative controls ( n.c. ) for CsgD and CsgA detection 
To verify the effect of the E3Q mutations on catalytic activities of MltE and MltC , we overexpressed the SLT domains from these proteins as fusions to the maltose-binding protein , MBP . 
The puriﬁed MBP-MltESlt and MBP-MltCSlt proteins were used in a zymogram assay for the degradation of the PG-rich Micrococcus cell wall . 
Wild-type MltE and MltC have PG hydrolytic activity , although the SLT domain of MltC proved to be much less active than the SLT domain of MltE in the zymogram assays . 
The catalytic-site E3Q mutants of MltE and MltC had signiﬁcantly reduced activities compared to the activities of the wild-type proteins , but their activities were not fully abolished ( Fig. 4B and C ) . 
It is unclear whether the residual activities observed in the zymogram assays also are present in the full-length proteins in vivo . 
Taken together , however , these results demonstrate that the catalytic activities of MltE and MltC were responsible for the positive effect of these lytic transglycosylases on the rdar morphotype expression . 
The stress sigma factors RpoS and OmpR are not involved in regulation of CsgD expression by lytic transglycosylases . 
The stress sigma factor RpoS is required for CsgD expression ( 45 ) . 
RpoS expression is regulated by a complex network involving a multitude of components and regulatory pathways . 
We investigated whether RpoS expression is involved in CsgD downregulation in the mltE mltC double mutant . 
The overexpression of RpoS from a plasmid did not restore rdar morphotype expression in the mltE mltC double mutant . 
In addition , in strain MAE52 , CsgD expression is independent of RpoS due to a single point mutation in the csgD promoter resulting in semiconstitutive , temperature-independent CsgD and rdar morphotype expression ( 49 ) . 
In the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant , the rdar morphotype was downregulated when grown at 28 and 37 °C ( data not shown ) . 
The csgD expression of the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant was reduced to 59 % of that of MAE52 ( Fig. 3A ) , and CsgD protein levels were even more reduced ( data not shown ) . 
Because a similar reduction was observed in the UMR1 background , where csgD expression is RpoS dependent , we conclude that CsgD regulation by MltE and MltC occurs independently of RpoS . 
OmpR is another global transcriptional regulator required for csgD expression ( 45 ) . 
The overexpression of OmpR did not restore the CsgD expression of the mltE mltC double mutant , suggesting that OmpR does not limit CsgD expression in the mltE mltC double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
MltE and MltC do not work through the Rcs and Cpx two-component systems . 
Two membrane-bound sensory systems monitor cell envelope stress . 
The complex two-compo-nent system Rcs senses perturbations in the PG layer ( 33 ) , with the response regulator proteins RcsB and RcsA serving as the output ( 35 ) . 
CpxR , the response regulator of the Cpx two-component surface-sensing system , suppresses CsgD expression and activates the expression of cell wall-degrading proteins ( 28 , 59 ) . 
To investigate whether PG degradation by MltE and MltC is sensed through either of the two signaling systems , we expressed MltE and MltEE65Q in the respective response regulator mutants . 
We also constructed response regulator mltE mltC triple mutants . 
The upregulation of rdar morphotype expression was observed upon the overexpression of MltE in all response regulator mutants , i.e. , rcsA , rcsB , and cpxR mutants ( see Fig . 
S1A in the supplemental material ; data not shown ) . 
Further , the deletion of the response regulator genes in the mltE mltC background did not prevent rdar morphotype downregulation ( see Fig . 
S1B ; data not shown ) . 
Consequently , the regulation of the rdar morphotype by MltE and MltC occurs independently of the Rcs and Cpx two-com-ponent systems . 
Interestingly , however , the expression of MltEE65Q in the rcsB mutant did not stimulate a mucoid phenotype ( i.e. , overproduction of colanic acid ) ( see Fig . 
S1A ) . 
This ﬁnding demonstrates that a speciﬁc envelope stress signal was induced by the catalytically inactive MltE , but it was not induced by the active form of MltE . 
c-di-GMP can partially compensate for the downregulation of rdar morphotype and CsgD expression in the mltE mltC deletion mutants . 
The second messenger c-di-GMP is known to regulate rdar morphotype expression ( 29 , 47 ) . 
We investigated whether c-di-GMP signaling is involved in rdar morphotype and CsgD expression through MltE and MltC . 
Six proteins that affect the c-di-GMP metabolism in S. Typhimurium were described to be speciﬁcally involved in CsgD regulation . 
Among them are the GGDEF-EAL domain diguanylate cyclase STM2123 and the EAL domain phosphodiesterase STM4264 ( 29 , 54 ) . 
To investigate the effect of elevated c-di-GMP concentrations , we deleted the phosphodiesterase STM4264 or overexpressed the di-guanylate cyclase STM2123 which leads to elevated CsgD expression in wild-type S. Typhi-murium UMR1 . 
CsgD expression in the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant was increased compared to that of the mltE mltC double mutant , but it did not reach the level of the STM4264 single mutant ( Fig. 5A and B ) . 
Consistently with this result , CsgD expression was upregulated upon the overexpression of the diguanylate cyclase STM2123 in the mltE mltC mutant ( Fig. 5C and D ) . 
We conclude that while higher intracellular c-di-GMP levels can partially compensate for the effect of MltE and MltC on rdar morphotype and CsgD expression , the effect of MltE and MltC is largely c-di-GMP independent . 
Morphological characterization of mltE mltC mutants . 
Lytic transglycosylases are responsible for the cleavage of the bacterial PG , which is essential for the separation of the daughter cells following cell division ( 19 ) . 
Therefore , the deletion of such a general function might have pleiotropic effects . 
However , we observed no difference in growth rates between the wild type and the mltE mltC double mutant when these strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C ( data not shown ) . 
Interestingly , the double mutant showed severe morphological alteration , i.e. , the formation of long chains , when grown at 28 °C in LB without salt ( Fig. 6A ; also see Fig . 
S2 in the supplemental material ) . 
These chains of cells subsequently were analyzed by TEM , which revealed that chain formation is due to the impairment of the cleavage of the PG septum ( Fig. 6B ) . 
The severity of the morphological alterations varied with growth conditions . 
When grown at 37 °C in LB medium , the mltE mltC double mutant showed only a few longer cells but no extended chains ( data not shown ) . 
The mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant , with an upregulated rdar morphotype ( due to higher intracellular c-di-GMP levels ) compared to that of the mltE mltC double mutant , also formed long chains at 28 °C in LB without salt medium ( Fig. 6A ) , while the STM4264 mutant looked like wild-type S.

Typhimurium UMR1 . 
As CsgD expression is upregulated in the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant ( Fig. 6B ) , these results indicate that long-chain formation and rdar morphotype expression represent two uncoupled phenomena . 
Long-chain formation also was observed in E. coli when six murein hydrolases were deleted ( 19 ) . 
Note that no morphological alterations were detected for the mltE and mltC single mutants ( data not shown ) . 
As another phenotype that can result from defective lytic transglycosylases , the integrity of the cell envelope was tested . 
Increased cell membrane permeability leads to susceptibility to bile acids . 
The mltE mltC double mutant , respective single mutants , and the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant were grown on MacConkey agar , which contains bile salts . 
The mltE mltC double mutant and the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant were unable to grow on MacConkey agar plates ( data not shown ) , showing that the deletion of these two lytic transglycosylases increases the permeability of the cell envelope . 
S. Typhimurium , like other Gram-negative bacteria , is resistant to vancomycin , as the outer membrane is a barrier for this high-molecular-weight antibiotic . 
However , resistance to vancomycin was not affected by the mltE mltC mutations ( data not shown ) , which demonstrates that membrane integrity is not entirely lost .

DISCUSSION
In this study , we identiﬁed two lytic transglycosylases of family I , the catalytic activities of which speciﬁcally affect rdar morphotype expression ( bioﬁlm formation ) in S. Typhimu-rium . 
We established that these transglycosylases act upon the expression of CsgD , the key rdar morphotype transcription factor . 
In total , we identiﬁed nine lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium . 
In contrast to E. coli , which harbors ﬁve transglycosylases of family I ( 30 , 52 ) , in S. Typhimurium seven belong to family I , while MltA belongs to family II and MltB to family III . 
This functional redundancy makes the assignment of speciﬁc functions complex . 
In this work , we demonstrate that two lytic transglycosylases of family I , MltE and MltC , are speciﬁcally involved in the expression of the rdar morphotype . 
MltE and MltC have different domain structures . 
While MltE contains an SLT domain only , MltC contains an additional domain of unknown function , DUF3393 . 
The SLT domains of MltE and MltC show closer similarity to each other than to other lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium . 
MltE and MltC may be redundant with respect to the regulation of CsgD expression , i.e. , only the absence of both proteins has an effect on CsgD and rdar morphotype expression . 
However , while MltE overexpression fully complemented the mltE mltC double mutant , MltC overexpression complemented it only partially . 
This may be explained by signiﬁcantly higher levels of MltE compared to those of MltC despite identical expression sequences . 
An alternative is that the functions of MltC and MltE are complementary because MltE is believed to be an endo-acting transglycosylase ( 2 ) , whereas MltC is an exoenzyme ( 32 ) . 
Ours is not the ﬁrst report linking lytic transglycosylases ( also known as autolysins ) to bioﬁlm formation . 
For example , the mltE gene was found to promote bioﬁlm formation in a recent screen of E. coli mutants ( 38 ) . 
Furthermore , in ﬁrmicutes ( low-GC Gram-positive bacteria ) , interference with PG turnover alters surface adherence and bioﬁlm formation ( 1 , 9 , 20 ) . 
Several possibilities may be considered for how MltE and MltC affect CsgD expression . 
First , activities of these lytic transglycosylases can be sensed in the cytoplasm via PG deg-radation products , anhydromuropeptide monomers , which are transported to the cytoplasm primarily by the permease AmpG ( 27 ) . 
The deletion of AmpG , however , had no effect on rdar morphotype expression ( data not shown ) . 
Similarly , the deletion of NagE and ManYZ transporters for PG degradation products such as GlcNac and glucosamine , as well as an ampG nagE manYZ triple mutant , had no effect on CsgD expression or rdar morphotype formation ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , cytosolic anhydromuropeptides or other PG degradation products do not seem to be involved in signaling to regulate CsgD expression . 
Second , extracytoplasmic stress has been shown to downregulate CsgD expression and rdar morphotype ( 43 , 61 ) . 
Anhydromuropeptide monomers or subsequent PG degradation products may initiate signaling in the periplasm . 
However , neither the well-studied Rcs phosphorelay system , the major signaling pathway that senses perturbations in PG turnover ( 6 , 24 , 33 ) , nor the Cpx phosphorelay system was found to contribute to the downregulation of CsgD by MltE/MltC . 
Consistently with this ﬁnding , susceptibility to selected - lactam antibiotics was not changed in the mltE mltC double mutant ( data not shown ) . 
Overexpressed catalytically inactive MltE , however , is sensed through the Rcs phosphorelay system , leading to a mucoid phenotype . 
It is feasible that MltE binding to its substrates without degradation causes periplasmic stress . 
Alternatively , overexpressed , catalytically impaired MltE may interfere with other periplasmic proteins . 
Third , altered membrane permeability may affect CsgD levels via an as-yet uncharacterized signaling pathway . 
In E. coli , the deletion of six lytic transglycosylases has been shown to alter membrane permeability ( 19 ) . 
In S. Typhimurium , the deletion of MltE and MltC was , under the growth conditions used here , already sufﬁcient to alter membrane permeability to some extent . 
Consistent with the idea that altered membrane permeability affects rdar morphotype is the observation that in E. coli , the loss of outer membrane integrity due to the deletion of the Tol system resulted in the downregulation of the curlimediated bioﬁlm ( 61 ) . 
Also in line with this possibility is our observation that the periplasmic lipoprotein NlpI represses CsgD expression and rdar morphotype expression via an unknown mechanism ( 50 ) . 
Fourth , the connection between MltE and MltC with CsgD and rdar morphotype expression can be a structural one , as lytic transglycosylases have a role in the assembly of macromolecular complexes ( 30 ) . 
As we could not identify an already known regulatory pathway involved in the regulation of rdar morphotype expression by MltE and MltC , we screened for suppressor mutants of the mltE mltC double mutant phenotype by random transposon mutagenesis . 
We identiﬁed suppressor mutants in STM2680 , STM2773 , and STM4363 which restored rdar morphotype expression to wild-type levels . 
None of these genes is described to be involved in rdar morphotype and CsgD expression , suggesting that the lytic transglycosylases MltE and MltC regulate rdar morphotype and CsgD expression through a novel pathway . 
In summary , the complex regulation of the rdar morphotype underscores the importance of the bioﬁlm mode of growth . 
For the ﬁrst time , we uncovered a speciﬁc signaling role of two family I lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium that commu nicate the status of cell wall turnover to the master regulator of bioﬁlm formation .
