Strains of Salmonella Typhimurium are a signiﬁcant cause of human disease in England and Wales , with an average isolation rate of 5500 per annum for the past 20 years , and a peak of 7785 isolations in 1983 ( Public Health Laboratory Service , Salmonella Data set , www.phls.co.uk ) . 
Towards the end of the 1980s , strains of Salmonella Typhimurium belonging to deﬁnitive phage type ( DT ) 104 emerged as an important cause of human infections , and these were of particular concern due to their resistance to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulphonamides and tetracyclines . 
By 1996 , these multiple-resistant strains comprised over 80 % of strains of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 received by the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens ( Threlfall et al. 1997 , 2000 ) . 
Since 1988 strains of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 , and particularly those with multiple drug resistance , have been associated with cattle in the UK ( Calvert et al. 1998 ; Hollinger et al. 1998 ; Wray et al. 1998 ; Threlfall et al. 2000 ) and cattle emerged as an important reservoir for these bacteria . 
Carriage appears to be greatest in dairy herds and overt disease occurs most frequently in calves ( Hollinger et al. 1998 ; Wray et al. 1998 ) . 
Strains of Salmonella Typhimurium express lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) antigens 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 ( Rowe and Hall 1989 ) , and infection of cattle with Salmonella Typhimurium results in the expression of serum antibodies to one or more of these LPS antigens as detected by an ELISA ( Hoorfar and Bitsch 1995 ) . 
However , an ELISA requires a cut-off value for delineating antibody-positive sera from those without signi-ﬁcant levels of antibodies speciﬁc for Salmonella Typhimu-rium LPS . 
The technique of immunoblotting has the ability to produce a qualitative measure of antibody-binding and can facilitate the determination of an ELISA cut-off value . 
The present study involved a herd of 329 cattle , located on a mixed beef/sheep farm in western Scotland , with an ongoing history of infection with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 activity . 
These cattle were screened for serum antibodies to LPS antigens with a combination of ELISA and immunoblotting . 
The immunoassays developed for detection of bovine antibodies were used to examine the serum antibody response of cattle with an ongoing history of infection with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 , and following vaccination with Bovivac S , a vaccine prepar-ation comprising a mixture of formalin-ﬁxed whole-cells of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Dublin .

Bacteria
Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 strain P470527 , antigenic code : 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 ; i ; 1 , 2 , was used for the preparation of LPS . 
A strain of Salmonella Kentucky ( S193198 ) was used as a source of H 1/4 i ﬂagellar antigens in the absence of the 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 LPS antigens . 
Outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) were prepared from Salmonella München strain JT54 ( antigenic code : 6 , 8 ; d ; 1 , 2 ) . 
A strain of Salmonella Moscow ( JT 1534 ) carrying the 1/4 O 12 LPS antigen in the absence of O 1/4 1 , 4 , 5 was used to 1/4 assess the degree of reaction to the O 12 LPS antigen . 
Bacteria were grown on nutrient agar ( Difco ; product code : 0001 -- 15 ) at 37 C for 16 h. All strains were from the culture collection held by the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens , and stored on Dorset 's egg medium at ambient temperature . 
Strains of Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from cattle were identiﬁed as described previously ( Chart et al. 1989a ) and phage typed using the method of Anderson et al. ( 1977 ) . 
Sera
A total of 646 sera was received from a herd of 329 cattle , located on a mixed beef -- sheep farm in western Scotland . 
Animals were sampled , in the winter of 2000/2001 , immediately prior to vaccination and 315 animals were sampled 35 days later . 
Antimicrobial resistance
Isolates were tested for sensitivity to a panel of 14 antimicrobial agents by an in-agar break point dilution method in DST agar ( Oxoid Ltd ) . 
Brieﬂy , an approximate 1000-fold dilution of a four-hour tryptone water culture broth ( 37 C ) was ` spotted ' onto antibiotic-containing agar plates and control plates using a multipoint inoculator . 
Plates were incubated at 37 C overnight before checking for growth . 
The antibiotics tested and ﬁnal plate concentrations were as follows : ampicillin ( A : 50 lg ml ) 1 ) , cefotaxime ( Cf : 1lg ml ) 1 ) , chloramphenicol ( C : 20 lg ml ) 1 ) , ciproﬂoxacin ( Cp : high and low level tested separately using 0Æ5 lg ml ) 1 and 0Æ125 lg ml ) 1 , respectively ) , furazolidone ( Fu : 20 lg ml ) , gentamicin ( G : 20 lg ml ) , kanamycin ( K : 20 lg ) 1 ) 1 ml ) , nalidixic acid ( Nx : 40 ) 1 lg ml ) 1 ) , netilmicin ( Nt : 20 lg ml ) 1 ) , spectinomycin ( Sp : 100 lg ml ) 1 ) , streptomy-cin ( S : 20 lg ml ) 1 ) , sulphamethoxazole ( Su : 100 lg ml ) 1 ) , tetracycline ( T : 10 lg ml ) 1 ) and trimethoprim ( Tm : 2 lg ml ) . )

Plasmid proﬁling
Bacterial isolates were grown in brain heart infusion broth ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , England ; product code : CM225 ) and the cells from 1 ml of culture was used to prepare plasmid DNA by the method of Kado and Liu 1981 ) . 
Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under u.v. transillumination . 
Strains of E. coli ( 39R861 and V517 ) with plasmids of known size served as standards ( Threlfall et al. 1986 ) . 
Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
One millilitre of the same broth culture used for plasmid proﬁling was washed and resuspended in sterile physiolo-gical saline to a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 5 . 
This was mixed 1 : 1 with molten 2Æ0 % agarose ( Bio-Rad , Pulsed-Field Certiﬁed ) in saline and plugs prepared . 
These were placed in lysis buffer ( 0Æ5 mol l ) 1 EDTA , 1 % sarkosyl , 1Æ0 mg ml ) 1 Proteinase K , pH 9Æ5 ) and incubated overnight at 56 C. Following washing in 10 mmol l Tris , ) 1 10 mmol l EDTA , pH 7 ) 1 Æ5 at 54 C , plugs were stored in TE buffer at 4 C until required . 
Prior to electrophoresis , plugs were digested with 0Æ2 -- 0Æ8 U ll ) 1 XbaI ( Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) in 100 ll of the appropriate reaction buffer at 37 C overnight . 
Electrophoresis was carried out on a CHEF DR-II system ( Bio-Rad ) using 1 % 
( w/v ) agarose with a Tris-borate buffer ( 44Æ5 mmol l ) 1 Tris , 44Æ5 mmol l ) 1 boric acid , 1Æ0 mmol l ) 1 EDTA ; AccuGENE , BioWhittaker , Walkersville , Maryland , USA ) , alongside DNA prepared from molecular reference marker strain Salmonella Typhimurium strain NCTC12416 ( LT2 ) , for 23 h ( 6 V cm ) , initial switch : 5 s ; ﬁnal switch 60 s ) 1 ( 14 C ) . 
Proﬁles of DNA were visualized and photographed under u.v. transillumination following staining with ethidium bromide ( 5 lg ml ) 1 ) . 
Vaccination
Immediately following the initial blood sampling , cattle received one dose of the commercial vaccine Bovivac S ( Intervet UK Limited , Milton Keynes , UK ) . 
The vaccine preparation comprised a mixture of formalin-ﬁxed whole cells of Salmonella Typhimurium ( O 1/4 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 ) and Salmonella Dublin ( O 1/4 1 , 9 , 12 ) with an adjuvant of aluminium hydroxide . 
Each cow received approximately 2 -- 5 · 109 bacteria , injected subcutaneously on the side of the neck . 
The dose was determined by the size and maturity of the animal . 
Preparation of outer membranes
Outer membranes ( OMs ) were prepared by suspending bacteria in ice-cold 25 mmol Tris ( hydroxymethyl ) meth - ) 1 ylamine ( Tris ) adjusted to pH 7Æ4 with HCl ( Tris-HCl ) containing 1 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid diso - ) 1 dium salt , prior to sonic disruption of bacterial cells . 
Following sedimentation of unbroken bacteria ( 5000 g , 30 min , 4 C ) , cell envelopes were sedimented ( 18 000 g , 1 h , 4 C ) and suspended in 20 ml 25 mmol Tris-HCl ) 1 pH 7Æ4 containing 0Æ5 ml Sarkosyl ( Merck Ltd : product code : NL30 ; Chart and Grifﬁths 1985 ) . 
After mixing ( 120 rev min ; 20 C ) , bacterial envelopes were sedimented ) 1 ( 18 000 g , 1 h , 4 C ) and suspended in 25 mmol Tris - ) 1 HCl pH 7Æ4 . 
Protein content was estimated using the method of Lowry et al. ( 1951 ) . 
Outer membrane preparations were stored at -- 20 C until required for SDS-PAGE . 
Preparation of lipopolysaccharide for SDS-PAGE
Bacteria grown on nutrient agar were harvested and transferred to preweighed eppendorf tubes . 
Tubes were reweighed and the cell mass suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer ( Laemmli 1970 ) to give a cell concentration of 1 mg 30 ll ) 1 . 
Following incubation at 100 C ( 10 min ) , preparations were cooled and mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 lg proteinase-K ( Sigma Chemical Company Ltd ; product code : P6556 ) 30 ll ) 1 . 
Following incubation at 60 C for 1 h , 30 ll samples containing 500 lg cell mass were applied to SDS-PAGE gels . 
SDS-PAGE
Bacterial proteins and LPS polysaccharide chains were separated by SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli ( 1970 ) . 
Preparations were applied onto a gel comprising a 4Æ5 % acrylamide stacking gel and either a 10 % or 12Æ5 % separation gel , and electrophoresis performed for 2 1/4 h at 50 mAmp ( Chart and Grifﬁths 1985 ) . 
Proﬁles were either stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( Chart and Grifﬁths 1985 ) or for LPS with a silver stain for carbohydrate ( Tsai and Frasch 1982 ) . 
Samples of outer membrane protein were incubated with sample buffer at 100 C before electrophoresis . 
Preparations of outer membrane proteins were examined alongside protein standards of 94 , 66Æ2 , 45 , 31 , 21Æ5 and 14Æ4 kDa ( low molecular weight standards : BioRad Ltd ) . 
Immunoblotting
SDS-PAGE proﬁles of LPS were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper ( NCP ) by immunoblotting ( Chart et al. 1989b ) ( 0Æ50 Amp , 1 h ) . 
Proﬁles immobilized on sheets of NCP were blocked with 3 % skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline ( milk-PBS ; 30 min ) and reacted with 30 ll serum in 5 ml of milk-PBS for 60 min . 
After washing in PBS-Tween ( 3 · 10 min ) , proﬁles were reacted with either 5 ll lane ) 1 of rabbit antibovine IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Sigma ; product code : A-0668 ) or 5 ll lane ) 1 of sheep antibovine IgM conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Universal Biologicals , Gloucester , UK ; product code : A10-101 AP ) in skimmed milk-PBS ( 60 min ) . 
After washing , as above , proﬁles were placed in substrate buffer ( 0Æ1 M Tris , 0Æ09 M NaCl , 0Æ15 M Mg2Cl .6 H2O ) for 10 min . 
For colour development , NCP strips were placed in substrate buffer ( 10 ml ) containing 45 ll nitroblue tetrazo-lium ( Sigma ; product code : N-6876 , 75 mg/ml in 70 % aqueous dimethyl formamide ) and 35 ll 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate . 
Na2 ( Sigma ; product code : B-6149 , 50 mg/ml in deionized water ) . 
Preparation of LPS for ELISA
Lipopolysaccharide was prepared from OMs ( Chart 1994 ) based on the hot-phenol method of Westphal and Jann ( 1965 ) . 
Outer membranes were suspended in 5 ml of deionized water and mixed with 5 ml of 80 % w/v aqueous phenol solution ( Merck Ltd , Poole , Dorset ; product code : 29479 ) . 
Following incubation at 68 C for 15 min , the preparation was centrifuged ( 3000 g , 30 min , RT ) and the aqueous phase harvested and transferred to a clean glass container . 
The remaining phenol phase was mixed with 5 ml of deionized water , incubated at 68 C for 15 min and centrifuged ( as above ) . 
The aqueous phase was removed and mixed with the initial aqueous phase fraction prior to dialysis against 3 · 5 l of deionized water at 4 C . 
The aqueous fraction was lyophilized and the LPS weighed . 
The LPS was analysed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining for carbohydrate for comparison with whole-cell LPS . 
It was also checked for purity by staining with a sensitive silver stain for protein ( Wray et al. 1981 ) . 
ELISA
ELISA plates ( Bibby Sterilin , Staffordshire , UK ; product code : 611F96 ) were ` coated ' with 0Æ25 lg LPS well ) 1 in ) 1 100 ll ` coating ' buffer ( 15 mmol Na2CO3 ; 34Æ5 mmol ) 1 NaHCO3 ; 4 C , 16 h ) , washed ( · 3 ) with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS : 140 mmol NaCl ; 2 ) 1 Æ7 mmol ) 1 KCl ; 8 mmol ) 1 ) 1 Na2HPO4 ; 1Æ5 mmol KH2PO4 ) containing 0Æ05 % ( v/v ) Tween-20 and ` blocked ' with 200 ll 1 % ( v/v ) normal guinea pig serum ( 37 C , 30 min ) . 
After washing , as described above , wells received 100 ll · of serum diluted ( 1000 ) in PBS prior to incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were then washed and wells received 100 ll of rabbit antibovine IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Sigma ; product code : A-0668 ) diluted ( · 5000 ) in PBS , or 100 ll of sheep antibovine IgM conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Universal Biologicals , Stroud , Gloucestershire ; product code : A10 -- 101AP ) diluted ( · 5000 ) in PBS . 
After 2 h incubation at room temperature , plates were washed ( · 3 ) and to each well was added 200 ll of 1 mg ml p-nitrophenol phosphate ( Sigma ; product ) 1 code : O-104 ) in diethanolamine buffer ( 1 mol dethanol - ) 1 amine , 0Æ5 mmol ) 1 MgCl2 , pH 9Æ8 ) . 
After incubation at room temperature ( 1 h ) the resultant yellow colour was quantiﬁed by measuring the optical density at 405 nm ( A405 ) .

Bacteria
Sixteen strains of Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated from 16 of 329 cattle and 15 of these belonged to DT104 , one strain belonged to phage type DT104b . 
Shedding was not detected in any animal more than once . 
All strains were resistant to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , spectinomycin , streptomycin , sulphonamides and tetracycline . 
They carried a 90 MDa plasmid and one strain also carried a plasmid of 2Æ1 MDa . 
All strains had the same pulsed-ﬁeld gel electro-phoresis proﬁle designated as xtm1 . 
Serology: prevaccination
A total of 329 blood samples was examined by ELISA for serum antibodies binding to the LPS expressed by Salmon-ella Typhimurium . 
Sera were listed in order of descending ELISA value ( O.D. 405 ) ( Fig. 1 ) and reacted with Salmonella Typhimurium LPS by immunoblotting ( Fig. 2 , lane 1 ) . 
Sera with an ELISA reading of 0Æ9A405 or above were shown to contain antibodies of the IgG-class only , to the LPS of Salmonella Typhimurium using immunoblotting ( Fig. 2 , lane 2 ) and this reading was selected as a cut-off value . 
Only 11 of the sera produced ELISA values of sera ‡ 0Æ9A405 and two of these were from cattle with faecal Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 . 
Using immunoblotting , the 11 sera were reacted with OMPs prepared from Salmonella München ( Fig. 2 , lane 3 ) and the 52Æ5 kDa ﬂagellar proteins expressed by Salmonella 1/4 Kentucky ( H i ) ( Fig. 2 , lane 4 ) . 
Only one of the 11 sera contained antibodies binding to all three bacterial used to detect serum antibodies to the 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 LPS antigens ( lane 2 ) . 
Outer membrane proteins prepared from Salmonella München strain JT54 ( lane 3 ) and ` i ' ﬂagellar antigens expressed by Salmonella Kentucky ( S193198 ) ( lane 4 ) , stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue , were used to detect antibodies binding to these proteins . 
Lane 5 contains protein molecular weight markers of 94 , 66Æ2 , 45 , 31 , 21Æ5 and 14Æ4 kDa preparations . 
None of the 11 sera contained antibodies binding to the LPS of Salmonella Moscow ( O 1/4 12 ) . 
Serology: postvaccination
Postvaccination sera were obtained from 315 cattle , and of these 87 gave ELISA values greater than the 0Æ9A405 cut-off value ( mean 1/4 1Æ15 ± 0Æ22 , n 1/4 87 ) . 
Sera were listed in order of descending ELISA value ( O.D. 405 ) and 20 sera with the highest ELISA readings were reacted with LPS prepared from Salmonella Typhimurium , OMPs prepared from Salmonella München and ﬂagellar proteins expressed by Salmonella Kentucky ( H 1/4 i ) . 
Only three of the 20 sera contained antibodies binding to the H 1/4 i ﬂagellar antigens , and one of these was from a cow which had serum antibodies to ﬂagellar antigens prior to vaccination . 
As observed with animals prevaccination , cattle with high levels of antibodies to the LPS of Salmonella Typhimurium did not have antibodies binding to the LPS of Salmonella Moscow . 
D I S C U S S I O N
Sixteen of the cattle were shedding multiresistant faecal Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 which had the same antimicrobial resistance type ( ACSSpSuT ) and PFGE proﬁles , indicating a common infectious agent within the herd . 
Using an LPS ELISA with immunoblotting , an ELISA value of 0Æ9A405 was deduced as a suitable cut-off value , and based on this , 11 cattle were considered to have serum antibodies binding to the LPS of Salmonella Typhimurium at the ﬁrst sampling . 
These antibodies were directed at epitopes on the O 1/4 4 and/or 5 antigens and not the O 1/4 12 moiety , which was in contrast to previous studies with humans infected with Salmonella Typhi and chickens infected with Salmonella Enteritidis where serum antibodies were directed predominantly at the O 1/4 12 LPS antigens ( Chart et al. 1990 , 1994 ) . 
The observation that the serum antibodies were of the IgG-class , and not of the IgM-class , indicated that the cattle had been infected for a period of time sufﬁcient for the IgG response to have developed , and for the IgM-class response to have occurred and subsided . 
The reasons for the lack of response to the H 1/4 i antigens were not clear but may have resulted from either repression of ﬂagellar expression in vivo or poor antigenicity of the ﬂagellar proteins in these cattle . 
Studies with humans infected with Salmonella Typhi showed that over 60 % of patients produced serum antibodies to ﬂagellar antigens ( Chart et al. 1997 ) . 
Nevertheless , it would appear that ﬂagellar proteins were unsuitable for the serodiagnosis of infections of cattle with Salmonella Typhimurium . 
For nine of the cattle with serum antibodies to LPS , faecal Salmonella Typhimurium were not detected . 
Combining results of bacteriology and serology , a total of 25 ( 7Æ6 % ) of the cattle was shown to have evidence of infection as opposed to 16 ( 4Æ8 % ) based on the isolation of Salmonella Typhimurium alone . 
This study illustrated the importance of combining ELISA with immunoblotting to enable the determination of an accurate ELISA cut-off value ; studies using ELISA alone would not have this accuracy . 
However , it must be emphasized that serology can only provide evidence of infection with an organism carrying the O 1/4 4 , 5 antigens , and the results of immunoassays must be considered in the light of the fact that many of the group B Salmonella spp . 
also carry the O 1/4 4 and 5 LPS antigens ( Rowe and Hall 1989 ) . 
Using the ELISA cut-off point determined by immuno-blot testing , 87 ( 26 % ) of the cattle had of serum antibodies to Salmonella Typhimurium LPS at the time of the second sampling ; 74 % did not but this would not necessarily indicate lack of protection against subsequent infection with this organism , since the degree of cellular immunity was not known . 
The aim of the present study was to develop an immunoassay for detecting evidence of infection with Salmonella Typhimurium . 
The ELISA we describe , used in association with immunoblotting , provides a sensitive and accurate method for detecting serum antibodies to the LPS of Salmonella Typhimurium and , in theory , has the potential to detect antibodies to the LPSs of other Salmonella spp . 
1/4 expressing the O 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 antigens .
