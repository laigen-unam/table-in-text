Abstract 
Bacterial cell-to-cell communication , termed quorum sensing ( QS ) , controls bacterial behavior by using various signal molecules . 
Despite the fact that the LuxS/autoinducer -2 ( AI-2 ) QS system is necessary for normal expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 ( SPI-1 ) , the mechanism remains unknown . 
Here , we report that the LsrR protein , a transcriptional regulator known to be involved in LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS , is also associated with the regulation of SPI-1-mediated Salmonella virulence . 
We determined that LsrR negatively controls SPI-1 and flagella gene expressions . 
As phosphorylated AI-2 binds to and inactivates LsrR , LsrR remains active and decreases expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes in the luxS mutant . 
The reduced expression of those genes resulted in impaired invasion of Salmonella into epithelial cells . 
Expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes was also reduced by overexpression of the LsrR regulator from a plasmid , but was relieved by exogenous AI-2 , which binds to and inactivates LsrR . 
These results imply that LsrR plays an important role in selecting infectious niche of Salmonella in QS dependent mode .

Introduction
Bacteria control gene expression patterns in response to changes in their population density through a process called quorum sensing ( QS ) . 
In QS , small signaling molecules called autoinducers are synthesized and released from the bacterial cells , and accumulate in the external environment [ 1 ] . 
When cell density reaches a certain level , producing autoinducer concentrations over a minimal threshold , the autoinducers bind to cognate receptors to promote changes in gene expression [ 2 ] . 
QS systems regulate a large number of physiological processes in bacteria including biofilm formation , virulence factor production , bioluminescence , sporulation , motility , and antibiotic production [ 3,4,5,6,7 ] . 
Several types of QS systems have been described in various species of bacteria . 
Many Gram-negative bacteria employ acyl homoserine lactones for intraspecies communication [ 8 ] , whereas Gram-positive autoinducers are typically peptides [ 9 ] . 
Another QS pathway , in addition , in which signaling is mediated by the LuxS-produced autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) , has been found in both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria [ 10 ] . 
The LuxS protein is found in over 55 bacterial species [ 11 ] , and catalyzes the conversion of S-ribosylhomocysteine to 4,5-dihydroxy-2 ,3 - penta-nedione ( DPD ) , which spontaneously cyclizes to form the signaling molecule AI-2 [ 10 ] . 
The LuxS/AI -2 QS system is present in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) , whose signal molecule has been identified as ( 2R ,4 S ) -2 - methyl-2 ,3,3,4 - tetrahydroxytetra-hydrofuran [ 12 ] . 
In S. Typhimurium , AI-2 is imported by the Lsr transporter , an adenosine triphosphate-binding-cassette transport-er encoded by the lsr operon and comprised of LsrA , LsrB , LsrC , and LsrD . 
The internalized AI-2 is phosphorylated by LsrK and modified further by LsrF and LsrG [ 13 ] . 
Phosphorylated AI-2 
( phospho-AI-2 ) binds to the repressor protein LsrR , inactivating it and derepressing transcription of the lsr operon ( see Fig.S1 ) [ 13 ] . 
S. Typhimurium causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans due to acute intestinal inflammation , and also causes a typhoid-like disease in mice . 
During infection of animal hosts , Salmonella invade epithelial cells of the small intestine . 
Invasion is mediated by a type three secretion system encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) . 
The SPI-1 type three secretion system forms a needlelike complex through which a number of effector proteins are translocated into host cells and mediate modification of the actin cytoskeleton [ 14 ] . 
Expression of SPI-1 is controlled by various environmental cues including oxygen tension , osmolarity , pH , and nutrients , reflecting the complex conditions in the intestinal lumen [ 15,16,17 ] . 
Previously , we reported that LuxS-mediated QS is required for normal expression of a subset of genes within SPI-1 and contributes to virulence of S. Typhimurium because deletion of the luxS gene decreased the transcription of SPI-1 genes and impaired invasion of Salmonella [ 18 ] . 
In contrast , another study recently reported that mutation of the luxS gene has no effects on the expression of SPI-1 and Salmonella virulence in a mouse infection model [ 19 ] . 
LuxS could have different effects on SPI-1 expression depending on the exact experimental conditions because of its pleiotropic functions [ 20 ] . 
Thus , the contradictory results may be resolved by a more complete understanding of LuxS effects on SPI-1 expression . 
We sought to clarify the role of LuxS by finding a factor that links LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS and SPI-1 expression . 
In the present study , we report that LsrR , a DNA-binding repressor of the lsr operon [ 21 ] , negatively controls expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes and also regulates the ability of Salmonella to invade host cells . 
Results
Salmonella LuxS Mutant is Indeed Defective for InvF-dependent Expression of SPI-1 Genes and Attenuated for 
Virulence in Mice luxS deletion mutants have widely been used to reveal the roles of QS in bacterial physiology . 
However , the role of LuxS in Salmonella pathogenesis is controversial . 
We reported that a 
Salmonella strain lacking the luxS gene displays defects in virulence phenotypes associated with SPI-1 expression [ 18 ] , but these findings were not reproduced by others [ 19 ] . 
These contradictory results could be due to the pleiotropic effects of luxS mutation [ 20 ] , or reflect a recently described non-quorum sensing function of LuxS [ 22 ] . 
To clarify the role of LuxS in Salmonella virulence , it is necessary to identify the factor that directly connects LuxSdependent QS to regulation of SPI-1 virulence genes . 
Before searching for such a factor , we confirmed that luxS is required for normal SPI-1-mediated Salmonella virulence . 
We showed that luxS deletion causes reduced expression of the invF gene , which in turn decreases expression of the InvF-regulated SPI-1 genes sicA , sigD , and sopE [ 18 ] . 
By conducting qRT-PCR , we determined that the mRNA levels of the sicA , sopB , and sopE genes decrease in both the DinvF strain and the DluxS DinvF double mutant strain ( Fig. 1A ) . 
Expression of invF from a plasmid restored transcription of sicA , sopB and sopE to wild-type levels in the DluxS DinvF and the DluxS strains as well as the invF deletion strain ( Fig. 1A ) . 
In contrast , the luxS expression from a plasmid failed to do so in both the DluxS DinvF and the DinvF strains ( Fig. 1A and data not shown ) . 
These data indicate that the reduced transcription levels of a subset of SPI-1 genes in the luxS deletion mutant 
were due to a decrease in InvF levels . 
Our previous finding showed that the luxS mutant is attenuated for virulence in mice was based on bacterial numbers in liver and spleen [ 18 ] , whereas Perrett et al. [ 19 ] reported that the luxS mutant did not display any significant differences in virulence compared to wild-type was based on number of live mice at day 12 post infection [ 19 ] . 
We decided to re-evaluate the virulence of the luxS mutant strain with a detailed monitoring ( i.e. monitoring for every 12 or 24 h ) of the survival of mice infected with Salmonella . 
Our data also show that all mice infected with either the wild-type or the luxS mutant strain died by 12 days after oral or intraperitoneal challenge ( Fig. 1B and C ) , but the survival of mice infected with the luxS mutant was significantly delayed compared to those infected with wild-type Salmonella ( Fig. 1B and C , p ,0.0001 ) . 
Taken together , these data emphasize that LuxS is necessary for normal expression of SPI-1 by controlling InvF and 
LsrR Negatively Controls Expression of SPI-1 Genes in the Absence of LuxS 
Because LuxS is not a DNA-binding protein , we hypothesize that there must be a transcription factor that links QS and SPI-1 regulation as described in other bacteria that regulate gene expression in response to QS [ 11 ] . 
In this sense , we focused on the LsrR protein , the repressor of the lsr operon , because it is the only known regulator controlled by Salmonella QS [ 1 ] . 
Phospho-AI-2 binds to LsrR inactivating its ability to act as a repressor and thereby inducing expression of the lsr operon [ 13 ] . 
Because the luxS deletion mutant can not produce AI-2 , LsrR is constitutively active . 
If LsrR negatively regulates the expression of SPI-1 genes , then deletion of the luxS gene would be expected to decrease expression of SPI-1 genes as we reported previously [ 18 ] . 
To test the hypothesis that LsrR lowers expression of SPI-1 genes , we constructed DlsrR and DlsrR DluxS strains carrying a chromosomal invF-lacZ fusion . 
b-galactosidase assay determined that deletion of lsrR had no effect on transcription of the invF-lacZ fusion ( Fig. 2A ) . 
However , the absence of LsrR compensated for the transcriptional defect in invF-lacZ expression in the luxS deletion mutant ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The regulatory effects of LsrR in the absence of luxS gene were analyzed in cultures with ( Fig. 2A ) or without shaking ( data not shown ) . 
This result was confirmed to be due to the absence of LsrR function because expression of LsrR from a heterologous promoter reduced invF transcription in the DluxS DlsrR double mutant strain ( Fig . 
S2 ) . 
These results suggest that in the absence of LuxS-catalyzed AI-2 production , LsrR represses InvF expression , which in turn reduces transcription levels of the InvF-regulated genes within SPI-1 . 
The internalization of Salmonella into epithelial tissues of animal hosts is mediated by a number of gene products expressed from the SPI-1 locus [ 14 ] , suggesting a role for LsrR in regulating internalization . 
We next examined whether LsrR regulates the invasiveness of Salmonella . 
Deletion of luxS impaired the ability of Salmonella to invade HEp-2 epithelial cells ( Fig. 2B ) , as we reported previously [ 18 ] . 
If both lsrR and luxS are deleted , however , invasion of HEp-2 cells is comparable to that of the parental lsrR + + luxS strain ( Fig. 2B ) . 
These results are in good agreement with the finding that lsrR deletion restored expression levels of InvF in the luxS deletion strain ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Taken together , our results suggest that , when activated by the absence of AI-2 , the LsrR protein represses SPI-1 expression , which impairs Salmonella 's invasiveness . 
Overexpression of the LsrR Protein Lowers Expression of SPI-1 Genes 
The down-regulation of invF expression by LsrR was only observed in the absence of LuxS ( Fig. 2 ) . 
This may be because the levels of active LsrR protein ( i.e. , LsrR not associated with AI-2 ) were elevated in the absence of LuxS . 
In contrast , LsrR could be present in a phospho-AI-2-bound inactive form in a luxS strain , + which could explain why deletion of lsrR gene alone did not alter invF expression ( Fig. 2A ) . 
If this were the case , overexpression of the LsrR protein could increase levels of active LsrR protein to a level sufficient to suppress expression of SPI-1 genes even in a strain carrying the luxS gene . 
To test this idea , we constructed a strain carrying a chromosomal invF-lacZ fusion and harboring the plasmid pJH1 in which expression of LsrR is under control of the lac promoter . 
b-galactosidase assays show that IPTG induction of LsrR protein lowers the transcription levels of invF by about 4-fold ( Fig. 3A ) . 
qRT-PCR analysis confirms that overexpression of LsrR decreases transcription of several SPI-1 genes : the transcript levels of the invF , sicA , sopB , and sopE genes were reduced by approximately 
also for normal virulence of Salmonella . 
3 - to 4-fold when the wild-type strain harboring pJH1 was grown with IPTG ( Fig. 3B ) . 
Next , we used Western blot analysis to investigate whether levels of a SPI-1 protein were affected by LsrR overexpression . 
Western blot analysis determined that overexpression of LsrR in the wild-type strain dramatically reduced levels of the SopB protein ( Fig. 3C ) . 
Although the mRNA fold changes and protein levels were different in the LsrR-overexpression and wildtype strains , the negative regulatory effects of LsrR were consistent . 
The data presented here demonstrate that the LsrR regulator negatively controls expression of SPI-1 genes . 
Overexpression of LsrR Inhibits Invasion into Epithelial Cells
We next investigated whether the reduced expression of SPI-1 genes resulting from LsrR overexpression affects the ability of Salmonella to invade mammalian cells . 
When HEp-2 epithelial cells were incubated with the wild-type strain carrying pJH1 that had been grown with IPTG to induce LsrR expression , invasion was greatly impaired ( i.e. , 17 % invasion compared to that of the wildtype strain ; Fig. 4 ) . 
Expression of SPI-1 and motility are both required for Salmonella cells to gain entry into epithelial cells [ 14,23 ] , but the requirement for motility can be overcome through the use of mild centrifugation [ 23 ] . 
To examine whether the defective invasion phenotype of

LsrR-overexpressing Salmonella was solely due to the decrease in SPI-1 expression , or whether motility might also be affected , a mild centrifugation was applied to promote bacterium-host cell contacts during the invasion assay [ 23 ] . 
Although invasion was still decreased in the LsrR overexpressing strain when adherence of Salmonella cells to the epithelial cells was promoted using centrifugation ( Fig. 4 ) , invasion was only 62 % that of the wildtype strain ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Thus , centrifugation partially restored invasion of HEp-2 cells by Salmonella overexpressing LsrR . 
The LsrR Protein Negatively Regulates Expression of Flagella Genes
Because the enhanced contact of bacterium-host cell by centrifugation partially recovered the defective invasiveness of LsrR-overexpressing Salmonella , we reasoned that motility of 
Salmonella might also be regulated by LsrR or LuxS . 
We examined the effect of luxS and lsrR deletions on expression of fliC which encodes flagellin , the major component of the flagellum [ 24 ] , by using chromosomal fliC-lacZ fusion strains . 
b-galactosidase assays determined that fliC expression decreased in the luxS deletion mutant , unaffected by deletion of lsrR , and elevated in the DluxS DlsrR double mutant ( Fig. 5A ) . 
These results indicate that LsrR represses transcription of the fliC gene in the absence of LuxS . 
We next investigated the effect of LsrR overexpression on flagella gene expression . 
b-galactosidase assays revealed that in the fliC-lacZ fusion strain carrying pJH1 , the transcription levels of fliC decreased by approximately 4-fold upon IPTG addition ( Fig. 5B ) . 
Moreover , qRT-PCR determined that the mRNA levels of the flhD and fliA , which encode key regulators of flagella synthesis [ 24 ] , were reduced by approximately 3-fold when the wild-type strain harboring pJH1 was grown with IPTG ( Fig. 3D ) . 
Analysis of secreted proteins showed that LsrR overexpression in wild-type Salmonella greatly reduced levels of the flagella proteins , FliC , FliD , and FlgL ( Fig. 5C ) . 
Levels of the SPI-1 effector proteins SipA , SipC , and SipD , were also lowered upon LsrR overexpression , consistent with the regulatory role of LsrR for SPI-1 genes ( Fig. 5C ) . 
These results indicate that , in addition to regulating the

SPI-1 genes , the LsrR protein also negatively regulates flagella genes . 
The LsrR Protein Suppresses Motility of Salmonella
Because expression levels of flagella decreased in the LsrR-overexpressing Salmonella strain ( Fig. 5B and C ) , we asked whether the flagella structure is affected by LsrR levels . 
Transmission electron microscopy using a negative stain allows visualization of flagella appendages on the surface of the S. Typhimurium cells [ 24 ] . 
Using transmission electron microscopy , we were able to observe flagella on the Salmonella cells harboring the vector pUHE21-2lacI ( Fig. 5D ) , but not on cells carrying pJH1 grown in q the presence of IPTG to induce LsrR overexpression ( Fig. 5D ) . 
We also compared the motility phenotypes of the wild-type Salmonella strains harboring pUHE21-2lacI and pJH1 . 
We found q that both strains were motile in the absence of IPTG ; however , motility of the strain carrying pJH1 was abolished in the presence of IPTG ( Fig. 5E ) . 
These results show that the overexpression of LsrR suppresses Salmonella motility . 
LsrR-mediated QS Controls Expression of SPI-1 and Flagella Genes
As LsrR is a repressor of an operon comprising AI-2 transporter , overexpression of LsrR turns off the QS system of Salmonella and results in impaired invasiveness with reduced expression of SPI-1 and flagella as described above . 
Those effects may be associated with AI-2 signaling and QS or be an artifact resulting from ectopic expression of LsrR without any relevance to QS . 
We reasoned that we could distinguish between these two possibilities by modulating the levels of AI-2 in the overexpression strain because the phospho-AI-2 binds to LsrR , inactivating it [ 13 ] . 
If LsrR regulates SPI-1 and flagella genes in response to QS , addition of exogenous AI-2 should result in derepression of those genes . 
This experiment is complicated by the fact that the strain overexpressing LsrR can not import and phosphorylate AI-2 due to repression of the lsr operon and lsrK [ 25 ] . 
To circumvent this problem , the promoters of the lsr operon and the lsrK gene were replaced with the promoter of the chloramphenicol resistance gene ( Pcat ) which is constitutively expressed [ 26 ] , and not repressed by LsrR ( Fig. 6A ) . 
To test whether LsrR regulates SP1-1 and flagella genes in response to QS , we examined the expression of chromosomal invF-lacZ and fliC-lacZ fusions in Pcat-lsr strains ( containing Pcat-lsrA and Pcat-lsrK ) harboring pJH1 that were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG or exogenous AI-2 . 
As expected , overexpression of LsrR reduced expression levels of the invF and fliC genes ( Fig. 6B and C ) . 
Exogenous AI-2 restored expression of both the invF and fliC genes in dose dependent manner ( Fig. 6B and C ) . 
In agreement with the transcriptional changes , the decreased production of flagella and the SopB protein observed upon LsrR overexpression was restored upon the addition of AI-2 ( Fig. 6D and E ) . 
In WT with backbone plasmid , however , exogenous AI-2 with or without IPTG did not affect the expression of both invF and fliC genes ( Fig . 
S3A and B ) and the production of SopB protein ( Fig . 
S3C ) .

We also asked whether addition of AI-2 to the Pcat-lsr Pcat-lsrK strain could restore the defective invasiveness resulting from LsrR overexpression . 
Overexpression of LsrR inhibited invasion of both the wild-type and the Pcat-lsr strains into epithelial cells ( 17 % and 25 % invasion relative to the wild-type strain , respectively ; Fig. 6F ) . 
However , addition of exogenous AI-2 restored the invasion phenotype of the Pcat-lsr strain , but not the wild-type strain ( Fig. 6F ) . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that the LsrRmediated QS signaling system modulates expression of SPI-1 and flagella , and consequently invasion of Salmonella into host cells . 
Discussion
QS systems have been proposed to play a role in virulence of several pathogens based on studies of luxS mutant phenotypes , including Escherichia coli O157 : H7 [ 27,28 ] , Streptococcus pyogenes [ 4,29 ] , Porphyromonas gingivalis [ 30 ] , Neisseria meningitides [ 31 ] , and Salmonella Typhimurium [ 18 ] . 
However , because the luxS gene has also been proposed to have non-QS functions [ 22 ] , it can be difficult to define a role for LuxS-mediated QS in bacterial pathogenesis . 
Indeed , although we have reported the role of LuxS/AI -2 QS in regulation of SPI-1 in S. Typhimurium [ 18 ] , another report indicated that LuxS did not play a role in SPI-1 regulation [ 19 ] . 
In S. Typhimurium , the regulatory network for AI-2 signaling is comprised of an AI-2 transporter complex , LsrABCD , the LsrR repressor , and the LsrK signal kinase [ 13 ] . 
LsrR regulates AI-2 uptake by directly binding and repressing the promoter of the lsr operon [ 21 ] . 
Because LsrR is the only known transcription factor in QS in Salmonella , we hypothesized that LsrR might connect LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS to SPI-1 regulation . 
Here , we report that the LsrR protein can negatively regulate expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes , and impair Salmonella 's invasion into mammalian cells . 
Consistent with previous report [ 32 ] , the deletion of lsrR gene in wild-type Salmonella did not alter invF expression . 
However , the deletion of lsrR in the luxS mutant strain restored the reduced expression of the invF and fliC genes in the luxS mutant strain to the wild-type levels ( Fig. 2A and Fig. 5A ) . 
These results suggest that LsrR is involved in regulation of SPI-1 and flagella genes , in contrast to a recent proposal that the regulatory function of LsrR is limited to the lsr operon [ 32 ] . 
The luxS deletion mutant would produce constitutively active LsrR due to the lack of AI-2 , which supports the idea that LsrR might link LuxS-mediated QS and SPI-1 regulation and allows us to reveal additional target of LsrR in Salmonella Typhimurium . 
Overexpression of LsrR in wild-type Salmonella reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of SPI-1 ( Fig. 3 ) and flagella genes ( Fig. 5A , B , and C ) . 
These results emphasize that LuxS-mediated QS controls SPI-1 and flagella expression with AI-2-regulated LsrR activity playing a pivotal role . 
We tested whether LsrR might regulate expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes by directly binding to their promoters . 
However , electrophoretic mobility shift assays failed to reveal LsrR protein binding to DNA fragments carrying promoters of SPI-1 and flagella genes such as invF , sopB , flhDC , and fliC , while LsrR did bind to the promoter DNA of lsr operon ( data not shown ) . 
It is possible that additional factor ( s ) may be required for LsrR binding to the target promoter or that LsrR works indirectly . 
Although we do not understand the molecular basis of how the LsrR protein negatively controls transcription of SPI-1 and flagella genes , our findings clearly indicate that LsrR has regulatory targets than the lsr operon in Salmonella , as reported in Escherichia coli [ 25 ] . 
Overproduction of LsrR from a plasmid reduced entry into epithelial cells ( Fig. 4 ) , perhaps by generating increased levels of the active form of LsrR ( i.e. , LsrR not associated with phospho-AI-2 ) . 
This result is consistent with our previous report that the luxS mutant was defective for invasion [ 18 ] . 
Moreover , decreased expression of flagella genes in bacterial cells possessing active form of LsrR has also been reported in a E. coli luxS mutant [ 7 ] . 
It is still possible that the altered expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes and reduced invasiveness resulting from LsrR overexpression might be artifacts unrelated with QS . 
However , that possibility is made less likely by the finding that treatment with exogenous AI-2 restored the behaviors of the LsrR-overexpressing Salmonella ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Overall , the data are consistent with a role for LsrR in regulating SPI-1 and flagella in response to QS . 
The LsrR regulator represses expression of the lsr operon and the lsrK gene [ 25 ] . 
Consistent with this , exogenous AI-2 only counteracted the effects of LsrR overexpression in the engineered Salmonella strain ( Pcat-lsr ) in which the promoters of the lsr operon and lsrK were replaced with the constitutive Pcat promoter . 
To further verify whether the regulatory functions LsrR on SPI-1 and flagella genes are controlled by phospho-AI-2 , we constructed a Salmonella strain ( Pcat-lsrA ) carrying only Pcat-lsrA and not Pcat-lsrK ( Fig . 
S4A ) . 
We reasoned that the Pcat-lsrA strain could uptake AI-2 but not phosphorylate it due to LsrR-mediated repression of the lsrK gene which encodes the AI-2 kinase [ 1,25 ] . 
The Pcat-lsrA strain failed to restore expression of the invF and fliC genes upon the addition of AI-2 ( Fig . 
S4B ) , indicating that LsrK is necessary for the LsrR protein to respond to AI-2 and control expression of SPI-1 and flagella ( see Fig . 
S1 ) . 
When ingested by a host animal , Salmonella reach the small intestine and penetrate the epithelial cells . 
LuxS is a highly conserved protein , and many species of bacteria produce AI-2 [ 5,11 ] . 
Based on our findings , we propose that Salmonella could recognize the site of infection by detecting and internalizing the AI-2 signaling molecules produced by microorganisms in the normal gut flora in addition to recognizing well known environmental signals such as high osmolarity to induce the expression of SPI-1 [ 33 ] . 
Moreover , studies of the known QS signaling mechanisms employing AI-2 have revealed that most QS bacteria are sensing the extracellular AI-2 rather than importing it [ 9,11 ] . 
Thus , AI-2 molecules produced by normal flora would accumulate in the intestinal tract . 
The ability of Salmonella to consume AI-2 molecules could be beneficial for their virulence because the consumption of AI-2 could interfere with communication between other bacterial species and perhaps disrupt the flora in a way that is favorable for Salmonella pathogenicity . 
In summary , we have presented evidence that active LsrR can negatively regulate expression of SPI-1 as well as flagella genes , and in doing so , reduce the ability of Salmonella to invade host cells . 
The effects of LsrR overexpression were relieved by exogenous treatment with the QS signal molecule , AI-2 . 
These findings suggest that S. Typhimurium may require QS for successful invasion when they have reached the proper environment . 
QS may also enable Salmonella cells to modulate expression of virulence factors when they reached a sufficient population level in the right niche .

Construction of Strains
SR3390 PinvF : : lacZ This study 
The method of Datsenko and Wanner [ 36 ] was used for chromosomal gene deletion , chromosomal lacZ fusion , and epitope tagging . 
For construction of a Salmonella strain carrying a chromosomal fliC-lacZ fusion , the Kan cassette from plasmid R pKD13 was amplified using primers fliC-lacZ-F and FliC-lacZ-R ( see Table 2 for primer sequences ) and the resulting polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products were introduced into the SL1344 strain containing the plasmid pKD46 , followed by selection for fliC : : Kan transformants . 
The Kan cassette was R removed using plasmid pCP20 [ 36 ] leaving an FRT site for introduction of lacZY using pCE70 [ 37 ] . 
Other chromosomal lacZ fusions were constructed following these procedures , and deletion mutants or epitope tagging mutants were constructed similarly including removal of the Kan cassette .

Western Blot Analysis
Salmonella strains expressing a HA epitope tagged version of SopB ( SopB-HA ) from the chromosome were grown in LB broth at 37uC . 
Bacteria were collected by centrifugation , and cell lysates were prepared using B-PER solution ( Pierce ) . 
Cell lysates were resolved in 12 % SDS-PAGE and the SopB protein was detected using anti-HA antibody ( Sigma ) . 
Western blot was developed using anti-mouse immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences ) . 
Invasion Assay

HEp-2 cells ( ATCC , CCL-23 ) were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin ( 50 U/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 50 U/ml ) . 
Confluent monolayers for infection with bacteria were prepared in 24-well tissue culture plates . 
Each well was seeded with 26105 cells suspended in DMEM-10 % FBS without antibiotics and incubated for 1 h at 37uC under 5 % CO2 . 
The wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) before bacterial cells were added . 
Bacterial cells were washed with PBS , suspended in pre-warmed DMEM medium , and then added onto the monolayer at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 . 
After 1 h of incubation , the wells were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS to remove extracellular bacteria and then incubated for 1 h with pre-warmed medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml of gentamicin ( Gm ) to kill extracellular bacteria . 
The wells were then washed three times with PBS to remove the Gm . 
The HEp-2 cells were lysed in 1 % Triton X-100 for 30 min , and then diluted with PBS . 
Dilutions of the lysed cell suspension were plated on LB agar medium to enumerate colony forming units ( CFUs ) . 
As necessary , the 24-well tissue culture plates were subjected to low-speed centrifugation ( 10 min at 500 6 g ) [ 14 ] . 
This mild centrifugation promotes bacterium-epithelial cell contact , which bypasses the requirement for bacterial motility in Salmonella invasion . 
CFU values for mutant strains were Salmonella divided by the mean CFU value for wild-type .

Animal Experiments
The experiment was conducted as described previously [ 43,44 ] . 
Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources at Seoul National University . 
The mice were kept under pathogen-free conditions in filter-topped cages in Individually Ventilated Cage Racks ( MSRS-M70S ; Orient Bio Inc. ) containing sterile bedding , and were fed sterile food and water ad libitum . 
All mice were acclimatized for at least 1 week prior to experimentation . 
Cohorts of ten mice were infected by oral gavage or intraperitoneally with about 10 CFU or 10 CFU of Salmonella 7 3 cells in 100 mL of PBS , respectively . 
Water and food were withdrawn 4 h before infection , and re-supplied 2 h post-infection . 
Mouse mortality was recorded daily . 
Supporting Information
synthesized by LuxS and accumulates extracellularly . 
Lsr transporter , encoded by lsr operon , internalizes the AI-2 into the cytoplasm , where it is phosphorylated to produce phospho-AI-2 by LsrK . 
LsrR represses the expression of lsr operon in the absence of phospho-AI-2 , while it is de-repressed in the presence of phospho-AI-2 molecules that bind and inactivate LsrR [ 13 ] . 
In this study , we demonstrated that LsrR negatively controls the expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes and this regulation was abolished by phospho-AI-2 .
