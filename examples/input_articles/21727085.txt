RNA thermometers are translational control elements that regulate the expression of bacterial heat shock and virulence genes . 
They fold into complex secondary structures that block translation at low temperatures . 
A temperature increase releases the ribosome binding site and thus permits translation initiation . 
In fourU-type RNA thermometers , the AGGA sequence of the SD region is paired with four consecutive uridines . 
We investigated the melting points of the wild-type and mutant sequences . 
It was decreased by 5 C when a stabilizing GC basepair was exchanged by an AU pair or increased by 11 C when an internal AG mismatch was converted to a GC pair , respectively . 
Stabilized or destabilized RNA structures are directly correlated with decreased or increased in vivo gene expression , respectively . 
Mg also 2 + affected the melting point of the fourU thermometer . 
Variations of the Mg concentration in the physio-2 + logical range between 1 and 2 mM translated into a 2.8 C shift of the melting point . 
Thus , Mg binding 2 + to the hairpin RNA is regulatory relevant . 
Applying 2 + three different NMR techniques , two Mg binding sites were found in the hairpin structure . 
One of these binding sites could be identified as outer sphere binding site that is located within the fourU motif . 
Binding of the two Mg ions exhibits a 2 + positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.47 . 
Free energy values `` G for Mg2 + binding determined by NMR are in agreement with data determined from CD measurements . 
INTRODUCTION
The maintenance of the intracellular metal ion concentration is an indispensable requirement for the viability of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells . 
Cells exhibit high intracellular K and Mg concentrations while cytosolic + 2 + Na and especially Ca concentrations are kept low ( 1 ) . 
+ 2 + By varying the K concentration , cells adopt the intracel - + lular to the extracellular osmolality ( 2 ) . 
K acts as + counterion for nucleic acids ( DNA , RNA ) ( 3,4 ) and has been found to stabilize the structure of cytosolic proteins . 
Mg is prominent for binding and activating ATP ( 5 ) as 2 + well as intracellular enzymes ( 1 ) . 
In addition to K , it is + the most important cation acting as counterion of nucleic acids ( 1,4 ) . 
It is involved in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the plasma membrane ( 6 ) and stabilizes proteins . 
In gram-negative bacteria , Mg binding to lipo-2 + polysaccharides stabilizes the periplasmic membrane ( 7 ) . 
Most importantly , it is strictly required for rRNA folding , ribosome assembly and ribosome function ( 8,9 ) . 
The importance of Mg ions for the viability of pro-2 + karyotic cells has some important implications . 
First , Mg starvation leads to growth arrest of bacterial 2 + cultures ( 10 ) . 
Second , although the amount of Mg 2 + within a prokaryotic cell may vary by a factor of three , the RNA [ kg ] : Mg [ kg ] ratio ( 2 + & 68 ) is almost constant under differing environmental conditions ( 10 ) . 
Escherichia coli cells that enter the stationary phase reduce the concentration of ribosomes and thus reduce their Mg content ( 11 ) . 
Third , E. coli cells react on 2 + Mg starvation by the synthesis of polyamines including 2 + spermidine and putrescine which are able to substitute for Mg in many cases . 
For instance , the spermidine/Mg 2 + 2 + ratio bound to the ribosomal fraction of E. coli cells reduces with increasing extracellular Mg concentration 2 + ( 12 ) . 
Due to the diversity of different Mg binding part-2 + ners and the multitude of different intracellular Mg 2 + binding sites , most of the intracellular Mg is present in 2 + a bound form , albeit transiently . 
E. coli cells in the exponential growth phase have a Mg content of 90 -- 110 mM 2 + ( 13 ) , while only a small fraction of 1 -- 2 mM is present in the physiologically active free form ( 14 ) . 
In addition , most of the bound Mg fraction is in fast exchange with the 2 + free Mg in the cytosol ( 14,15 ) and a 20 -- 30 % loss of 2 + 2 + Mg is sufﬁcient for cell-growth arrest ( 14 ) . 
Due to this 2 + rapid exchange between free and bound Mg , also the concentration of the free form has to be controlled tightly by the cell itself to assure cell viability . 
Indeed , Mg ions 2 + have been found to be actively transported among others in E. coli ( 15 -- 19 ) , Bacillus subtilis ( 20 ) and Salmonella typhimurium ( 21 ) and the Mg transport mechanisms of 2 + S. typhimurium and E. coli are equivalent to each other ( 1,14,18,21 -- 25 ) . 
Ions are important for stabilizing RNA tertiary structure ( 3,9,26 ) . 
Most often , K and Mg cations serve this + 2 + task although Mn ions and polyamines such as spermi-2 + dine have the potential to substitute for some of the K + and Mg binding sites . 
Mn ions are able to substitute 2 + 2 + for 76 % of the bound Mg ions in E. coli without im-2 + pairing viability of the cells ( 18 ) . 
These ﬁndings provide support for using Mn ions to map Mg binding sites 2 + 2 + within an RNA molecule ( 27 -- 30 ) . 
Due to its small size and divalent charge , the Mg ion 2 + has a notably high charge density . 
Therefore , the ﬁrst water hydration sphere is more stable than for any other physiologically relevant cation ( 31 ) . 
Mg coordinates six 2 + water molecules with octahedral geometry . 
Mg ions are 2 + able to bind to RNA with different binding modes . 
Generally , ` inner sphere ' and ` outer sphere ' contacts can be distinguished ( 9 ) . 
In an ` outer sphere ' complex , water molecules of the Mg ( H O ) complex but not the Mg 2 + 2 + 2 6 ion itself make contacts to the functional groups of the RNA . 
In contrast , inner sphere contacts are characterized by at least one direct contact of the Mg ion to functional 2 + groups of the RNA . 
Inner sphere contacts can be classiﬁed by the number of inner sphere ligands other than H2O 0 ( type I , type II , type III , etc. ) , while ` type 0 is identical to an outer sphere contact ( 9 ) . 
Klein et al. ( 9 ) modeled Mg ions into the structure of the large ribosomal 2 + subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and found that 65 % of the bound Mg ions are outer sphere 2 + coordinated . 
Within the remaining inner sphere contacts , most contacts belong to the classes type I or type IIa where inner sphere ligands are orthogonally oriented to each other . 
Most of these Mg ions ( type I and type 2 + IIa ) are coordinated to either one or both non-bridging oxygens of the phosphate backbone . 
Outer sphere 2 + coordinated Mg ions are most often located within the major groove of the RNA helices and make indirect , water-mediated contacts to the heteroatoms of the nucleobases ( 9,27,32 ) . 
Mg has a profound effect on the structure and 2 + function of riboswitches ( 33 -- 35 ) . 
Riboswitches are biosensors that control gene expression in response to cellular metabolites that they bind with high afﬁnity and speciﬁ-city ( 36,37 ) . 
RNA thermometers are capable of sensing temperature . 
They control translation initiation of heat shock and virulence genes by sequestration of the Shine -- Dalgarno ( SD ) sequence at low temperatures ( 38 ) . 
At higher temperatures , the hairpin structure melts in a zipper-like manner allowing translation initiation to occur ( 39 ) . 
Helix stability in simple synthetic RNA therm-ometers is directly correlated to gene expression levels of the downstream gene ( 40 ) . 
We recently investigated the structure , function and melting mechanism of the Salmonella fourU RNA thermometer , which controls expression of the heat shock gene agsA ( 39,41 ) . 
In the present work , we examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of a point mutation that weakens an extraordinarily stable GC base pair , which had been shown to prevent unfolding of the wild-type RNA at lower temperatures ( 39 ) ( Figure 2 ) . 
Furthermore , we highlight the Mg binding properties of 2 + the fourU RNA thermometer . 
Using NMR spectroscopy , we identiﬁed and localized two Mg binding sites and 2 + determined their dissociation constants as well as the cooperativity between these binding sites . 
Mg-2 + dependent changes in thermal stability of the fourU RNA thermometer were determined by CD spectroscopy . 
Our study provides ﬁrst evidence for Mg binding of an 2 + RNA thermometer and its relevance for RNA thermom-eter function .

MATERIALS AND METHODS NMR spectroscopy
NMR measurements were performed on a 600 MHz ( 14.09 T ) Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm xyz-gradient probe and a 900-MHz ( 21.14 T ) Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm cryogenic HCN z-gradient probe . 
Spectra were recorded and processed using the Bruker TopSpin 2.0 / 2.1 software . 
Processed spectra were analyzed with Sparky 3.1.1.3 . 
MgCl2 titration experiments

CSP
Mg titration experiments of the 4U-hp2-wt RNA were 2 + performed in NMR buffer ( see RNA preparation section ) at a temperature of 10 C. [ H - N ] - HSQC experiments 1 15 were recorded at a B0 ﬁeld strength of 900 MHz ( 21.14 T ) using a standard pulse sequence ( 42 ) ( Topspin 2.1 pulse program library : fhsqcf3gpph ) with a hard Watergate pulse train for water suppression ( 43 ) . 
Spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 30 ppm in the 15 1 N-dimension and 22 ppm in the H-dimension . 
A total of 240 increments were recorded in the N-dimension and 15 4096 points in the H-dimension . 
[ H , N ] - HSQC spectra 1 1 15 were recorded at the following MgCl2 concentrations : 0 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3 , 5 and 7 mM .

Since association and dissociation of the Mg ions from 2 + the target RNA are fast on the NMR timescale , CSPs can be related to the Mg concentration within the sample 2 + according to the following equation : qfifififififififififififififififififififififififififififififififi 
Equation ( 2 ) is derived from the mass action law for an RNA/Mg equilibrium with the RNA having one Mg 2 + 2 + binding site . 
In Equation ( 2 ) f ( x ) is the CSP of an individual imino signal at a given x = [ Mg ] / [ RNA ] ratio , a i 2 + the ratio between dissociation constant ( KD ) and RNA concentration and b is the maximum CSP at inﬁnite Mg concentration . 
During the ﬁtting procedure , the par-2 + ameters a and b were allowed to adjust freely . 
CSP curves that showed biphasic behavior and could not be ﬁtted by Equation ( 2 ) were ﬁtted by a model assuming two different binding sites ( Figure 1 ) . 
Such a model is characterized by two macroscopic ( K1 , K2 ) and four microscopic ( K , K , K , K ) dissociation con-1 ,2 1,3 2,4 3,4 stants that connect four different RNA states ( I , II , III , IV ) . 
Considering a particular imino group , two different states with only one Mg ion bound ( states II and III 2 + in Figure 1 ) can have different or equal ( degenerated ) chemical shifts . 
Such model predicts that biphasic curves only depend on the macroscopic dissociation constants K1 and K2 . 
Monophasic curves , in contrast , detect either macroscopic or microscopic dissociation constants , depending on which chemical shifts of the four states are degenerated for a particular imino group . 
Microscopic and macroscopic dissociation constants are related to each other by the equations depicted in Figure 1 . 
Biphasic CSP curves can be ﬁtted by Equations ( 3 -- 5 ) , if the two binary complexes have different chemical shifts .

Whether chemical shifts are degenerated in the binary complexes or not , inﬂuences only the parameter b in the Equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) . 
In Equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the constants b and K1 ,3 can not be ﬁtted independently and can therefore be summarized to one constant . 
In Equations ( 3 ) -- ( 7 ) , [ A ] is the concentration of Mg - ions , ( AB ) and ( BA ) are the populations of the 2 + two different binary ( RNA * Mg ) - complexes and ( AB2 ) 2 + is the population of the ternary ( Mg * RNA * Mg ) -2 + 2 + complex . 
Parameters a and b are ﬁtting parameters that modulate the CSP amplitude . 
K1 , K2 are the macroscopic and K1 ,2 , K1 ,3 , K2 ,4 , K3 ,4 the microscopic dissociation constants of the Mg binding model which assumes two 2 + Mg binding sites ( Figure 1 ) . 
During the ﬁtting proced-2 + ure , the parameters a , b , K1 and K2 were allowed to adjust freely . 
In some cases , three out of four RNA states have degenerated chemical shifts and only one state has a differing chemical shift . 
For some of these cases , this results in monophasic CSP curves . 
For example , if state I has a differing chemical shift , the macroscopic dissociation constant K1 is detected . 
If state IV has a differing chemical shift from states I , II and III , the macroscopic dissociation constant K2 is detected .

MnCl PRE experiments 2
Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement ( PRE ) effects caused by paramagnetic Mn ions were analyzed for 2 + the observable imino groups within the 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
[ H - N ] - HSQC spectra of the imino region of a 1 15 4U-hp2-wt RNA sample were recorded in NMR buffer in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 at MnCl2 concentrations of 0 and 4 mM . 
Experiments were performed at a temperature of 10 C and a B0 ﬁeld strength of 900 MHz ( 21.14 T ) . 
The recycling delay was set to 3 s. Remaining acquisition parameters were identical to the MgCl2 titration experiments . 
PRE effects were quantiﬁed by intensity and line width analysis . 
Line width analysis was performed for the indirect N-dimension . 
Intensities and line widths were 15 analyzed with Sparky 3.1.1.3 . 
For the PRE analysis we plotted ln ( I [ 0 mM ] / I [ 4 mM ] ) for each observable imino signal and compared the results with the change in line width ( u [ 4 mM ] -- u [ 0 mM ] ) .

3 + Measurements were performed at a temperature of 10 C and a B0 ﬁeld strength of 600 MHz ( 14.09 T ) with a mixing time Tm of 150 ms. The spectrum was recorded with a spectral width of 15 ppm in the indirect dimension and 22 ppm in the direct dimension . 
A total of 896 increments were recorded in the t dimension and 2048 points in the t-1 2 dimension . 
Each increment was recorded with 128 scans .

RNA refolding was achieved by denaturing for 10 min at a concentration of 0.25 mM and a temperature of 95 C followed by 20-fold dilution with ice cold water and subsequent incubation at 0 C for another 30 min . 
RNAs were concentrated and exchanged to NMR buffer using Vivaspin 20 concentrators ( MWCO = 3000 Da ) . 
The NMR buffer contained 15 mM KxHyPO4 ( pH 6.5 ) , 25 mM KCl , 90 % H2O and 10 % D2O . 
Correct RNA folding was veriﬁed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

The 5 loading buffer was composed of 87 % glycerole , 0.1 % ( w/v ) xylene cyanole FF and 0.1 % ( w/v ) bromophenol blue . 
The 1 running buffer contained 50 mM Tris -- acetate and 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 8.3 ) . 
Gels were cast using 15 % acrylamide with an acrylamide : bisacrylamide ratio of 37.5:1 . 
Running conditions were set as follows : U = 70 V , P < 0.5 W for 4 h , water cooling to prevent heating . 
Gels were stained with ethidium bromide . 
CD melting and refolding curves were recorded with a JASCO spectropolarimeter J-810 at a wavelength of 258 nm .

CD melting and refolding curves were normalized according to Equation ( 9 ) and thermodynamic parameters ( Hunf , Sunf , Gunf and Tm ) were derived from Equations ( 10 ) to ( 12 ) .

Three different translational fusion constructs have been used to study the temperature dependence of gene expression in E. coli using the ß-galactosidase gene bgaB as reporter . 
Constructs were designed by introducing the 0 temperature sensitive hairpin 2 of the 5 - UTR of the Salmonella agsA gene in front of the heat stable ß-galactosidase gene bgaB utilizing an EcoRI restriction site ( underlined in the sequences ) . 
The 4U-hp2-wt construct contains the second hairpin of the fourU ( 4U ) RNA thermometer ( 41 ) in an optimized vector .

An amount of 25 ml LB-Amp ( 150 mg/ml ) , pre-warmed in a shaker to 30 C were inoculated with 1.5 ml over night culture ( 5 ml grown at 30 C ) of DH5a cells containing the plasmids . 
Cells were grown to an optical density ( OD600 ) of 0.5 . 
After induction of transcripts with 25 ml L-arabin-ose ( 10 % ) , 8 ml of the culture were shifted to two pre-warmed , shaking ﬂasks at different temperatures , respectively . 
After 30 min cells were used for the enzymatic assay as described before ( 47 ) . 
To compare the different measurements the expression value for the wt at 30 C was set to 1 , respectively . 
In our previous study , we determined base-pair stabilities of hairpin 2 ( 4U-hp2-wt , Figure 2B ) , which represents the temperature responsive hairpin of the Salmonella fourU thermometer , in comparison with a stabilized point mutant ( 4U-hp2-A8C-mutant ) , in which the AG mismatch of the wt structure was replaced by a CG pair ( Figure 2A ) . 
From this study , we concluded that the G14 -- C25 base pair is by far the most stable base pair in the thermometer hairpin and has a stabilizing effect on the secondary structure of the entire RNA helix ( 39 ) . 
Thus , substitution of this stable GC base pair into a less stable AU base pair ( Figure 2C ) is predicted to result in a signiﬁcant reduction of the thermal stability of the 4U-hp2 RNA . 
CD unfolding curves recorded on the G14A -- C25U double mutant indeed conﬁrmed the expected behavior ( Figure 3A ) . 
The GC to AU exchange resulted in a melting point T of 35.9 m C , which is 5.2 C lower than the Tm value of the wild-type RNA and 16.3 C lower than the 4U-hp2-A8C mutant RNA ( Figure 3A and B ) . 
Tm values for the three RNAs under investigation are given in Table 1 . 
Reversible melting and refolding of an RNA thermom-eter has recently been shown to be physiologically import-ant for ﬁtness of a cyanobacterium ( 48 ) . 
CD unfolding and refolding curves demonstrated a similar full reversibility of the unfolding transition of all three fourU hairpins investigated in the current study since start and end points of unfolding and refolding curves are identical ( Supplementary Figures S1 -- S3 ) . 
However , unfolding and refolding curves slightly differ due to disturbance of the equilibrium caused by the continuous temperature change during the temperature scan . 
For the subsequent analysis , melting and refolding curves were averaged ( the averaged curve will be referred to as unfolding curve from now on ) to derive the unfolding curve under equilibrium conditions . 
Unfolding curves were normalized according to Equation ( 9 ) and ( T ) values were determined assuming a two -- state model ( folded ; unfolded ) for RNA unfolding . 
The thermodynamic parameters Hunf , Sunf and Gunf were derived according to Equations ( 10 -- 12 ) from the ( T ) curves shown in Figure 3A . 
Hunf , Sunf , Gunf and Tm values for the three RNAs under investigation are given in Table 1 . 
From the Hunf and Sunf values , the corresponding Gunf ( T ) curves can be calculated according to the Gibbs -- Helmholtz equation . 
These Gunf ( T ) curves are illustrated for the wild-type RNA and the two mutants in Figure 3B . 
Remarkably , all three Gunf ( T ) curves exhibit an intersection point at Tc = 81.8 C . 
At this temperature , the three RNAs possess the same stability Gunf ( 81.8 C ) = 31.94 kJ/mol . 
At Tc , the unfolded RNA is almost exclusively populated since it is then much more stable than the folded conformation . 
Th existence of an intersection point of the Gunf ( T ) curves is a consequence of the linear enthalpy -- entropy correlation of the global unfolding transition which is depicted in Figure 3C . 
The slope of the Hunf ( Sunf ) correlation is equal to m = 354.9 K and the ordinate intercept was determined to be y0 = 31.95 ± 0.95 kJ/mol . 
Linear enthalpy -- entropy correlations for global unfolding transitions have been reported earlier by Searle and Williams ( 49 ) and by Petruska ( 50 ) for DNA duplexes . 
There is also a strong linear correlation between Gunf and Hunf ( Figure 3D ) in the fourU RNA thermometer . 
The slope of this correlation is temperature-dependent and is illustrated for a temperature of 20 C. Insertion of the enthalpy -- entropy correlation into the Gibbs -- Helmholtz equation results in the following equation : G 1/4 ðm TÞ S + y0 ð15Þ unf unf At the compensation temperature ( Tc = m ) , enthalpy and entropy contributions of the RNA-solvent interaction cancel each other and only the RNA -- RNA interactions remain and equal y0 . 
Helix unfolding can be approximated according to Searle and Williams ( 49 ) by the following equation

( B ) Secondary structure of the 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
( C ) Secondary structure of the 4U-hp2-G14A-C25U mutant RNA . 
Gunf ( Tc ) is affected by the increase in entropy upon unfolding , mainly caused by the gain of rotational freedom in the RNA backbone Srotation and the loss of stacking interactions between neighboring nucleobases Hstacking . 
At the compensation temperature Tc , the absolute value of the entropy term T * S exceeds by far the absolute value of the enthalpy term Hstacking . 
Thus , the RNA is almost completely unfolded at Tc ( GunfðTcÞ 1/4 y0 1/4 31:95 kJ = mol 0:95 kJ = mol ) . 
In order to test whether the in vitro observations correl-ate with translational control in vivo , the 4U-hp2-wt RNA , the 4U-A8C RNA and the 4U-G14A-C25U RNA were analyzed in the bgaB reporter gene assay as described previously ( 41 ) . 
The 50-UTRs were cloned 50-upstream of the bgaB reporter gene downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells . 
Transcription was initiated with 0.01 % ( w/v ) of L-arabin-ose and translation at various temperatures was followed by determination of b-galactosidase activity . 
Expression levels were normalized to the expression of the 4U-hp2-wt sequence at 30 C . 
The gene expression curves were consistent with the in vitro data in that the least stable G14A -- C25U mutant led to derepressed , perman-ently elevated reporter gene expression even at low tem-0 peratures ( Figure 4 ) . 
The wild-type 5 - UTR allowed intermediate gene expression at elevated temperatures whereas the stable A8C mutant blocked gene expression completely . 
The combined in vivo and in vitro results sho that seemingly minor mutational alterations can have a very signiﬁcant effect on RNA stability and functionality of a regulatory RNA element . 
By switching from the stable A8C sequence to the unstable G14A -- C25U sequence , gene expression levels can be increased by factors up to 150 . 
In addition , the wild-type RNA as well as the G14A -- C25U RNA are able to induce gene expression in response to a temperature shift from 30 C to 42 C by factors of 8.6 ( wt ) and 3.9 ( mut ) ( Figure 4 ) . 
Induction factors of at least 3.5 are described for functional thermoregulators ( 48,51 -- 53 ) and an overall enhanced reporter gene expression for mutants with slightly destabilized structures has also been observed for the ibpA thermometer from E. coli ( 51 ) . 
Therefore both agsA-50-UTR-variants , wild-type and G14A -- C25U , consisting only of the second hairpin of the natural occurring agsA thermometer , work well as control elements in the physiological range of living cells . 
We observed correlation between hairpin stability determined in vitro and gene repression levels measured in vivo . 
Interestingly , gene expression levels start to increase at temperatures signiﬁcantly lower than the melting point determined in vitro . 
Apparently , translation initiation already occurs even at temperatures where only a minor fraction of RNA thermometers are unfolded . 
Curvatures of the temperature dependent gene expression curves in vivo ( Figure 4 ) differ from the CD unfolding curves measured in vitro ( Figure 3A and B ) . 
Additional effects to the accessibility of the SD sequence seem to modify the gene expression in vivo . 
Other possible factors like the temperature dependence of transcription , RNA degradation or translation initiation may have add-itional modulating effects that superimpose the initial RNA thermometer effect .

Mg -dependence of the melting point
One well-known factor that contributes to folding of complex RNA structures is Mg . 
In addition , based on 2 + the sequence of the fourU thermometer , a Mg binding 2 + site can be predicted ( 32 ) . 
To examine whether this ion plays a structural and functional role in the fourU therm-ometer , we monitored the Mg dependence of the meltin 2 +

KCD was calculated for a temperature of 50.24 C. Errors are derived from the ﬁt . 
point Tm of the 4U-hp2-wt RNA by CD spectroscopy . 
The T ( Mg 2 + m ) dependence was ﬁtted by Equation ( 14 ) ( Figure 5 ) and G , T and TnoMg CD m , max m values were derived ( Table 2 ) . 
The Tm ( Mg ) dependence can be described by a model 2 + which assumes only a single binding site . 
NMR experiments , however , provide evidence for two Mg binding 2 + sites ( see below ) . 
Since Mg binding to these sites is co-2 + operative ( see below ) , the 4U-hp2-wt RNA exists most prominently in either the free form or the ternary complex ( [ Mg * RNA * Mg ] ) but rarely in one of the 2 + 2 + binary complexes ( [ Mg * RNA ] or [ RNA * Mg ] ) . 
Thus , 2 + 2 + the Tm ( Mg ) curve exhibits hyperbolic shape and the 2 + GCD value determined from the Tm ( Mg ) - dependence 2 + represents the free binding energy between free RNA and ternary [ Mg * RNA * Mg ] complex . 
In addition , we can 2 + 2 + show that the temperature dependence of Tm is caused by speciﬁc and not by diffuse Mg binding ( Supplementary 2 + Data : Evidence for deﬁned Mg binding ) . 
The fact that 2 + the temperature dependence is dominated by deﬁned Mg binding does not rule out the possibility of addition-2 + al diffuse binding . 
However , according to our data the effects of diffuse Mg binding are small in comparison 2 + to the effects caused by speciﬁc binding , at least in the concentration range observed here ( 0 -- 7 mM ) . 
The Mg dependence of Tm observed in vitro indicates 2 + a potential effect of ﬂuctuating Mg concentrations 2 + within the cell on expression levels of genes under the control of the fourU RNA thermometer . 
According to the literature , the free intracellular Mg concentration 2 + may vary between 1 and 2 mM ( 14,18 ) . 
Such a shift in Mg concentration causes a shift of the Tm value of the 2 + 4U-hp2-wt RNA by 2.8 C ( Figure 5 ) . 
Thus , varying Mg 2 + concentration will most probably have a modulating temperature-independent effect on RNA-thermometer-controlled gene expression in vivo .

Expression levels were referenced to the respective expression level of the 4U-hp2-wt at 30 C which was set to 1 . 
Localization of the Mg binding sites 2+
We applied different NMR methods to identify Mg 2 + binding sites in the 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
First , a NOESY experiment of a 4U-hp2-wt RNA sample in the presence of 1/2 CoðNH Þ 3 + 3 6 ions was performed to identify and localize 1/2 CoðNH Þ 3 + binding sites . 
1/2 CoðNH 3 + 3 6 3 Þ6 ions serve as mimic for hexahydrated Mg ions and therefore 2 + map binding sites for outer sphere coordinated Mg ions 2 + ( 28,29,32 ) . 
Second , we analyzed the PRE effects of the imino signals occurring upon the addition of paramagnetic Mn ions to the 4U-hp2-wt RNA sample ( 28,29 ) . 
The 2 + fact that substoichiometric amounts of Mn are sufﬁcient 2 + to cause signiﬁcant line broadening of imino signals in close proximity to Mg binding sites reveals that Mg 2 + 2 + ions are in rapid exchange with free divalent ions . 
The use of Mn as probe for Mg is supported by the observa-2 + 2 + tion that 76 % of the intracellular Mg ions in prokary-2 + otes ( E. coli ) can be substituted by Mn ions without 2 + severely impairing viability of the cells ( 18 ) . 
Third , we followed CSPs of the imino signals during Mg titration 2 + experiments ( 28,29 ) . 
Fitting of the obtained CSP curves was performed to derive KD values for Mg binding . 
By 2 + taking the results of these three complementary techniques into account , it became possible to unravel the different effects on how Mg ions interact with the 4U-hp2-wt 2 + RNA . 
Combination of the information yields a consistent overall picture on the effects of Mg ions on the 2 + 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
The imino region of the 2D - H - H NOESY spectrum of 1 1 the 4U-hp2-wt RNA in the presence of 5 mM 1/2 CoðNH3Þ 3 + ions is given in Figure 6 . 
Protons from 6 1/2 CoðNH3Þ6 3 + exhibit strong cross peaks to the imino protons of the nucleobases U11 , U12 , G27 and/or G28 and weak cross peaks to the imino protons of the adjacent nucleobases U10 and U13 . 
Thus , a binding site for 1/2 CoðNH3Þ 3 + is located in close proximity to the 6 nucleobases U11 , U12 , G27 and G28 , most probably i the major groove of the RNA helix very similar to the binding site described for the structure of the P5b hairpin of the group I intron by Kieft and Tinoco ( 32 ) . 
PRE effects of the imino signals caused by the addition of Mn ions were analyzed in order to reveal divalent 2 + cation binding sites . 
For that purpose , [ H , N ] - HSQCs 1 15 of the imino region of the 4U-hp2-wt RNA sample were recorded and line shapes and intensities of the imino signals were analyzed to quantify the PRE effects . 
Changes in line widths and signal intensities caused by the addition of 4 mM Mn2 + are given in Figure 7 . 
Large PRE effects were observed for the nucleobases U11 and U12 within the RNA helix . 
In addition , the nucleobases U13 , G14 and U33 also show signiﬁcant PRE effects , while the imino signal of nucleobase U10 exhibits only a very weak PRE effect . 
Interestingly the G27/G28 double signal only shows a moderate PRE effect in comparison to U11 , U12 and U13 which is consistent with binding of 1/2 CoðNH Þ 3 + 3 6 in the major groove . 
Taken together , the PRE analysis reveals the existence of a Mn binding site within the 4U-hp2-wt RNA which 2 + is located in close proximity to the nucleobases U11 , U12 and U13 . 
This Mn binding site represents a strong indi-2 + cation for the existence of a Mg binding site at exactly 2 + the same position within the 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
Furthermore , PRE analysis and 1/2 CoðNH Þ 3 + NOESY 3 6 data reveal binding sites in the same region of the RNA leading to the conclusion that there is one speciﬁc outer sphere Mg binding site within the fourU motif of the 2 + 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
Moderate PRE effects of the nucleobases G27/G28 are in agreement with localization of this binding site within the major groove . 
Finally , we titrated 4U-hp2-wt RNA with Mg ions 2 + and analyzed the occurring CSPs of the imino group region within the [ H , N ] - HSQC spectra . 
CSP ( [ Mg ] ) 1 15 2 + curves were ﬁtted according to Equation ( 2 ) and KD values were derived . 
Figure 8 shows Mg - dependent 2 + CSPs of the imino groups with their respective ﬁts ( continuous lines ) . 
In Figure 8D , the shifting signals of the imino groups U5 and U13 within the [ H - N ] -1 15 HSQC during the titration of the RNA with MgCl2 are shown exemplarily . 
Fitting results are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 .

Kdiss values are obtained for different imino signals . 
Lowest Kdiss values are found for U4 ( 0.85 ± 0.18 ) and G14 ( 1.17 ± 0.12 mM ) . 
Nucleotides U5 , G6 and U13 exhibit Kdiss values of around 2.34 mM and the nucleotides U23 and U24 show Kdiss values of 3.56 mM . 
U13 shows by far the largest CSPmax value ( 0.250 ± 0.008 ppm ) . 
Multiple conformations of a [ RNA * Mg ] - complex 2 + assuming only a single Mg binding site fail to explain 2 + the observed diversity in Kdiss values as explained in the Supplementary Data ( Mg binding model for one 2 + binding site but different conformations of the [ RNA * Mg ] complex ) . 
2 + In addition , the CSP curve of U12 shows a distinct biphasic behavior . 
We argue that this behavior can only be explained by two different Mg binding sites . 
The 2 + model describing the binding properties of an RNA molecule with two different Mg binding sites is given 2 + in Figure 1 . 
The dissociation constants derived from the biphasic ﬁt ( CSP curve of U12 ) can be assigned to the macroscopic dissociation constants K1 ( 3.58 mM ) and K2 ( 2.06 mM ) . 
Since the observed CSP curves can not be explained by negative cooperativity ( negative cooperativity would lead to negative microscopic dissociation constants ) , cooperativity has to be positive . 
In such model , the smallest dissociation constants derived by monophasic ﬁtting have to be purely monophasic and correspond to one of the microscopic dissociation constants K2 ,4 and K3 ,4 . 
Thus , K2 ,4 was set to 1.17 ± 0.12 mM ( G14 ) and K3 ,4 to 0.85 ± 0.18 mM ( U4 ) as derived from monophasic ﬁtting of the CSP curves ( Figure 8 and Supplementary Table S1 ) . 
However , an assignment of the microscopic dissociation constant K2 ,4 ( 1.17 mM ) or the microscopic dissociation constant K3 ,4 ( 0.89 mM ) to the outer sphere Mg binding site within the fourU 2 + motif is not possible . 
According to the equations connecting the different dissociation constants ( Figure 1 ) , the microscopic dissociation constants K1 ,2 and K1 ,3 could 2 + be derived ( Table 3 ) . 
Free energy values for Mg binding GK1 and GK2 at a temperature of 10 C as well as the free energy for ternary [ Mg * RNA * Mg ] 2 + 2 + complex formation Gges are given in Table 3 . 
The macroscopic dissociation constant K1 is notably larger than K2 although formation of the binary complex is statistically favored over the formation of the ternary complex . 
The resulting microscopic dissociation constants connecting the free RNA and the binary complexes K1 ,2 ( 6.31 mM ) and K1 ,3 ( 8.26 mM ) are much larger than the corresponding dissociation constants K2 ,4 ( 1.17 mM ) and K3 ,4 ( 0.89 mM ) connecting the binary complexes with the ternary complex . 
In other words , binding of one Mg ion promotes binding of the 2 + second Mg ion ( positive cooperativity ) . 
According to 2 + the determined dissociation constants ( Table 3 ) , we determine a Hill coefﬁcient b = 1.47 ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . 
This intermediate positive cooperativity is in line with positive cooperativity values for Mg binding to 2 + tRNA reported in the literature ( b = 1.7 ) ( 54 ) Phe 
GK1 , GK2 and Gges were calculated for a temperature of 10 C. G ( 50.24 C ) was derived from CD melting studies . 
H , CD ges T * Sges and Gges ( 37 C ) were calculated from the difference of Gges ( 10 C ) and GCD ( 50.24 C ) . 
Errors in K1 , K2 , K2 ,4 , K3 ,4 and KCD ( Table 2 ) are statistical errors resulting from the ﬁt . 
Errors in K1 ,2 , K1 ,3 , GK1 ( 10 C ) , GK2 ( 10 C ) , Gges ( 10 C ) , GCD D ( 50.24 C ) , Hges and T * Sges ( 10 C ) are Gaussian errors calculated by error propagation . 
A description how two Mg binding sites may lead to 2 + the observed variety of monophasic CSP curves is given in the Supplementary Data ( Qualitative explanation of the observed CSP curves using a two binding site model ) . 
From the Mg dependence of the melting point Tm 2 + determined by CD spectroscopy ( Figure 5 and Table 2 ) , the free energy for Mg binding GCD at a temperature 2 + of 50.24 C was determined . 
Assuming that Mg only 2 + binds to the folded but not to the unfolded RNA GCD is equal to Gges . 
From the difference of Gges ( T = 10 C ) and GCD ( T = 50.24 C ) , Hges and T * Sges ( 10 C ) were calculated according to the Gibbs -- Helmholtz equation assuming that Hges and Sges are not temperature-dependent . 
Results are given in Table 3 . 
The T * Sges value ( 63.037 ± 6.404 kJ/mol ) indicates that the Mg - bound state exhibits a higher degree of 2 + order than the free RNA which appears reasonable since in the ternary [ Mg * RNA * Mg ] complex , rotational 2 + 2 + and translational degrees of freedom of the hexahydrated Mg ions are reduced . 
In particular , binding of two 2 + hexahydrated Mg ions to the RNA molecule is 2 + accompanied by the loss of three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom per hexahydrated Mg 2 + ion while the loss of one degree of freedom reduces the entropy by 1/2 R. However , this accounts only for 50 J / ( mol * K ) ( 2 * 6/2 * R ) which is far less than the observed change in entropy ( Sges = 223 ± 23 J / ( mol * K ) ) . 
Thus , additional entropy reducing effects have to be present . 
Such effects might be caused by an increased conform-ational restriction of the RNA itself or by a higher degree of order in the water molecules involved . 
This energetically unfavorable entropy term is overcompensated by stabilizing Hges contributions ( 90.855 ± 6.469 kJ / mol ) which most probably result from energetically favorable Coulomb interactions . 
Using GCD ( 50.24 C ) and Gges ( 10 C ) values ( Table 3 ) , the free energy for Mg binding Gges ( 37 C ) 2 + calculates to 21.807 ± 0.443 kJ/mol . 
Such value indicates that most probably not more than two Mg 2 + binding sites are involved since three or more Mg 2 + binding sites would lead to a lower Gges value or to Kdiss values higher than those reported for diffuse binding ( 55 ) . 
It may be noticed that the average Gges value that we obtained per magnesium binding site ( 10.9 kJ/mol ) is in surprisingly good agreement with the average value ( -- 11 kJ/mol ) that can be derived from the difference in concentration of bound and free magnesium in vivo ( 13,14 ) . 
In summary , these results indicate the existence of two Mg binding sites within the 4U-hp2-wt RNA . 
At least 2 + one of these binding sites is outer sphere coordinated and is located in proximity to the nucleobases U11 , U12 , G27 and G28 most probably within the major groove of the RNA . 
Although the existence of a second 2 + Mg binding site is certain , it could not be localized unambiguously . 
PRE experiments suggest that it is near the nucleobase U33 ( Figure 7 ) . 
The fact that only one binding site could be located with 1/2 CoðNH Þ 3 + 3 6 suggests that the second Mg binding site might be inner sphere 2 + coordinated . 
However , it is also possible that the two binding sites are in such close proximity that they can not be identiﬁed as two independent binding sites . 
Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments we show that fourU RNA thermometers are optimized in their sequence and Mg binding properties . 
Two Mg 2 + 2 + binding sites with positive cooperativity could be identiﬁed within the 4U-hp2-wt RNA , one of them as outer sphere binding site directly within the fourU motif as predicted from the secondary structure of this RNA 2 + ( 32 ) . 
Mg concentration has a modulating effect on the melting point of the fourU RNA thermometer and therefore most probably inﬂuences gene expression in vivo . 
From the in vivo experiments it became obvious that the onset of gene expression already occurs at temperatures signiﬁcantly below the melting point . 
Apparently , a small fraction of RNA thermometers in the open conformation seems to be sufﬁcient to efﬁciently permit translation initiation . 
In addition , the in vivo experiments reveal that already small changes in the temperature dependent stability ( Tm ) of the RNA thermometer lead to tremendous effects on gene expression of the downstream gene .
