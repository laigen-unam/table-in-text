ABSTRACT 
The ability of 71 strains of Salmonella enterica originating from produce , meat , or clinical sources to form bioﬁlms was investigated . 
A crystal violet binding assay demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences in bioﬁlm formation by isolates from any source when tested in any of the following three media : Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 2 % glucose , tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) , or 1/20th-strength TSB . 
Incubation was overnight at 308C under static conditions . 
Curli production and cellulose production were monitored by assessing morphotypes on Luria-Bertani agar without salt containing Congo red and by assessing ﬂuorescence on Luria-Bertani agar containing calcoﬂuor , respectively . 
One hundred percent of the clinical isolates exhibited curli biosynthesis , and 73 % demonstrated cellulose production . 
All meat-related isolates formed curli , and 84 % produced cellulose . 
A total of 80 % of produce-related isolates produced curli , but only 52 % produced cellulose . 
Crystal violet binding was not statistically different between isolates representing the three morphotypes when grown in TSB ; however , signiﬁcant differences were observed when strains were cultured in the two other media tested . 
These data demonstrate that the ability to form bioﬁlms is not dependent on the source of the test isolate and suggest a relationship between crystal violet binding and morphotype , with curli - and cellulose-deﬁcient isolates being least effective in bioﬁlm formation . 
Foodborne salmonellosis is responsible for an estimated 1.3 million illnesses and 553 deaths per year in the United States ( 16 ) . 
While meat , poultry , and eggs remain the leading vehicles for outbreaks , Salmonella has been isolated with increasing frequency from fresh produce in recent years ( 3 ) . 
A number of studies have demonstrated the ability of Salmonella to attach and form bioﬁlms on a wide variety of food contact surfaces , including metal , plastic , and rubber ( 14 , 26 , 31 ) . 
Sanitizers tested in our laboratory have proven incapable of inactivating Salmonella inoculated onto cantaloupe , especially when the organism was allowed to reside on the melon surface for more than 48 h ( 33 ) . 
In addition , the attachment strength of Salmonella on cantaloupe surfaces increased with increased contact time ( 32 ) . 
These results led to the hypothesis that salmonellae inoculated onto melon surfaces rapidly form bioﬁlms . 
Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated bioﬁlm formation by Salmonella Poona RM 2350 on cantaloupe rind tissue after just 24 h of storage ( 1 ) . 
The entrapment of cells of Salmonella within a bioﬁlm is likely responsible for enhanced sanitizer resistance and increased attachment strength . 
A bioﬁlm is generally deﬁned as `` a structured community of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced polymeric matrix and adherent to an inert or living surface '' ( 6 ) .

The presence of native microbial bioﬁlms has been visualized on a wide variety of plant surfaces , including endive , parsley , spinach , basil , leeks , and a variety of sprouts ( 10 , 11 , 20 , 21 ) . 
The formation of bioﬁlms by bacteria on plants likely improves the ability of these organisms to colonize and survive the harsh environment of the phyllosphere ( 19 ) . 
Bioﬁlm formation by Salmonella has only recently been investigated . 
Early work documented the production of thin aggregative ﬁmbriae ( curli ) by virulent strains ( 25 ) , but a conclusive role for these ﬁbers was not elucidated . 
The production of curli was later found to be an important component in the formation of an extracellular matrix by cells of Salmonella ( 24 ) . 
Recently , a second component of this matrix was found to be cellulose ( 22 , 34 ) . 
The production of cellulose and curli by Salmonella leads to a matrix of tightly packed cells covered in a hydrophobic network . 
This network of material is important in bioﬁlm formation as well as in its persistence on various surfaces ( 5 , 27 ) . 
While in vivo studies have shown that the production of cellulose may not be involved in the virulence of Sal-monella Enteritidis , cellulose-deﬁcient mutants were less persistent and more susceptible to chlorine treatments in solution ( 27 ) . 
These results indicate that cellulose and curli may play a role in the survival and resistance of salmonellae in the food environment . 
The recent increase in produce-related outbreaks of sal-monellosis , along with the indication that Salmonella readily forms bioﬁlms on cantaloupe surfaces ( 1 ) , gives rise to the hypothesis that perhaps produce-related isolates are able to survive in the harsh phyllosphere environment by exhib iting enhanced bioﬁlm formation . 
Furthermore , curli and cellulose production by produce-related Salmonella has not been investigated . 
Therefore , the objectives of our study were to ( i ) determine whether produce-related strains exhibited enhanced bioﬁlm formation in vitro compared to meat-related and clinical isolates , and ( ii ) screen our collection for cellulose and curli production .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 3934 , 942 , 1170/97 , and 1162/97 were obtained from Dr. Carlos Gamazo ( Department of Microbiology , University of Navarra , Spain ) . 
These isolates were used as comparison strains , as their cellulose and curli production has already been documented ( 28 ) . 
All other isolates were from the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- Agricultural Research Service -- Eastern Regional Research Center culture collection . 
A total of 15 clinical isolates ( Table 1 ) , 25 produce isolates ( Table 2 ) , and 31 meat isolates ( Table 3 ) were used in this study . 
Stocks were stored in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ; BBL/Becton Dickinson , Sparks , Md. ) containing 30 % glycerol at 2808C . 
Working cultures were maintained on tryptic soy agar ( BBL/Becton Dickinson ) slants at 48C . 
quantitated in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth supplemented with 2 % glucose , TSB , and 1/20th-strength TSB ( 1 ⁄ - TSB ) as previously 20 described ( 17 ) , with the addition of a ﬁxation step ( 808C for 30 min ) prior to staining with crystal violet . 
Heat ﬁxation has been used in crystal violet assays to measure bioﬁlm formation , and we found that it provided more reproducible results ( 12 ) . 
Brieﬂy , cells were cultured overnight in the appropriate medium and then diluted ( 1:10 ) and inoculated into 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , N.J. ) . 
Plates were incubated overnight at 308C under static conditions , and bioﬁlm formation was quantitated . 
Crystal violet -- stained bioﬁlms were solubilized in 95 % ethanol , and optical densities ( ODs ) were read at 590 nm in a microplate reader ( HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay 
Reader , Perkin Elmer , Norwalk , Conn. ) . 
Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated twice . 
and curli was determined as described previously ( 23 , 27 ) . 
The production of curli was characterized using LB ( BBL/Becton Dickinson ) agar without salt supplemented with 40 mg of Congo red per liter ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo. ) and 20 mg of brilliant blue per liter ( Sigma ) . 
Isolates were streaked onto Congo red plates and incubated for 48 h at 288C before determining morphotypes by comparing them to control strains . 
Isolates were grouped into three distinct morphotypes : ( i ) red , dry , and rough , indicating curli and cellulose production ( rdar ) ; ( ii ) brown , dry , and rough , indicating curli production but a lack of cellulose synthesis ( bdar ) ; and ( iii ) smooth and white , indicating a lack of both curli and cellulose production ( saw ) . 
Cellulose production was characterized by streaking isolates onto LB plates containing 200 mg of calcoﬂuor ( ﬂuorescent brightener 28 , Sigma ) per liter and incubating at room temperature for 48 h. Cellulose production was judged by comparing the ﬂuorescence of the test strains to that of the control strains under UV light ( 366 nm ) . 
All isolates were screened in duplicate and repeated twice .

Statistical analysis . 
The absorbance data for each individual observation were scaled against the values obtained for nonino-culated control wells of the respective 96-well plates . 
Resulting negative values were set to zero . 
For each of the three culture methods , the data from the multiple replicates were pooled , and the mean values were calculated for each isolate . 
To identify a relationship between the source of the isolate and the degree of crystal violet binding , the isolates were grouped as clinical , meat , and produce . 
The data for the groups were pooled and analyzed by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) ( P ,0.05 ; SigmaStat 2.03 , SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , Ill. ) for the effect of ( i ) isolate source and ( ii ) culture method . 
Occurrence of the various morphotypes ( or ﬂuorescence on LB plus calcoﬂuor plates ) among the three isolate groups was compared using chi-square analysis ( SigmaStat ) . 
Th absorbance data were collated on the basis of morphotype and ﬂuorescence and compared using ANOVA .

RESULTS
Results demonstrate that all Salmonella isolates produced signiﬁcant amounts of bioﬁlm when cultivated in the appropriate medium . 
Mean bioﬁlm formation in each of the three media tested is shown in Tables 1 through 3 . 
Bioﬁlm formation in LB supplemented with 2 % glucose was minimal compared to that in TSB or 1⁄20 - TSB ( as indicated by the large differences in OD values ) , indicating that bioﬁlm 1 formation was greatly enhanced in both TSB and ⁄ 20-TSB . 
Within the isolate groups , only clinical isolates bound signiﬁcantly more crystal violet in 1⁄20 - TSB than in standard TSB ( Table 4 ) . 
Meat - and produce-related strains had similar ODs , regardless of whether the assay was carried out using TSB or 1 ⁄ - TSB . 
20 In assessing bioﬁlm formation by the strains from the three sources , no differences could be detected between isolates when compared using similar media . 
For example , there was no statistical difference in crystal violet binding between clinical , meat-related , and produce-related strains when all three were tested in 1⁄20 - TSB . 
The formation of curli and cellulose was assessed on 
Congo red plates . 
Morphotypes were judged by comparing test strains to control strains as follows . 
Salmonella Enteritidis 3934 produces both curli and cellulose and expresses the rdar morphotype . 
Salmonella Enteritidis 942 produces curli but no cellulose and expresses the bdar morphotype . 
Salmonella Enteritidis 1162/97 and 1170/97 produces neither curli nor cellulose and results in the saw morphotype . 
Morphotypes of the strains tested in this study are presented in Tables 1 through 3 . 
The rdar morphotype was the most prevalent from all three sources , and the distribution of morphotypes was signiﬁcantly different among the three isolate groups ( chi-square P 5 0.004 ; Table 5 ) . 
Interestingly , the saw morphotype was detected only among produce-related isolates . 
A total of 73 , 84 , and 56 % of clinical , meat - , and produce-related isolates , respectively , produced both curli and cellulose . 
The bdar morphotype was more prevalent ( 27 and 24 % ) in the clinical and produce-related strains than in the meat-related ( 16 % ) strains ( Table 5 ) . 
Cellulose production was further tested by streaking isolates onto LB plates supplemented with calcoﬂuor . 
Results from these plates were in agreement with results from the Congo red plates , except for produce isolate Salmonella Typhimurium 45 ( Table 2 ) . 
All other isolates that were bda b Within isolate group , letters ( X , Y , Z ) indicate signiﬁcant differences among media ( P ,0.05 , ANOVA ) ; within medium , letter ( ) indicates no signiﬁcant differences among isolate groups ( P A .0.05 , ANOVA ) . 
or saw on Congo red plates were not ﬂuorescent on LB plus calcoﬂuor ( Tables 1 through 3 ) . 
We attempted to assess whether there was any relationship between morphotype and crystal violet binding . 
Isolates were sorted by morphotype and then compared by OD values in the various media ( Table 6 ) . 
When grown in LB plus 2 % glucose , bdar isolates were signiﬁcantly higher in crystal violet binding than were rdar and saw isolates . 
No signiﬁcant differences were observed between morphotypes when they were grown in TSB . 
The binding of crystal violet for bdar and rdar strains was statistically higher than that for saw isolates when grown in 1⁄20 - TSB . 
Note , however , that saw isolates produced the least amount of bioﬁlm in each of the three media .

DISCUSSION
We undertook this study to determine whether produce-related isolates exhibited enhanced bioﬁlm-forming capa bilities , given our observations of bioﬁlm formation by Sal-monella on cantaloupe surfaces . 
Previous authors have demonstrated Salmonella bioﬁlm formation on a variety of surfaces , but , to our knowledge , none have investigated whether this was inﬂuenced by the source of the test organism . 
We found isolates from all three sources to be strong bioﬁlm formers . 
These ﬁndings are in agreement with previously published reports on the high capacity of salmonellae to form bioﬁlms on plastic surfaces ( 26 , 29 , 30 ) . 
Bioﬁlm formation by produce-related isolates was not signiﬁcantly higher than that by meat or clinical isolates when tested in LB plus 2 % glucose , TSB , or 1⁄20 - TSB . 
Bioﬁlm formation has been shown to be an important determinant in the virulence of a number of pathogenic bacteria . 
Isolates of Enterococcus faecalis associated with endocarditis produced signiﬁcantly more bioﬁlm than did nonendocarditis isolates ( 18 ) . 
Djordjevic et al. ( 8 ) observed that bioﬁlm production of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes strains , which contain the majority of strains from clinical cases , was signiﬁcantly higher than that of lineage II and III strains . 
L. monocytogenes strains that were persistent in food production plants also demonstrated enhanced adherence compared to nonpersistent isolates ( 15 ) . 
Catheter-re-lated outbreak strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis were distinguishable from nonoutbreak strains by their ability to produce bioﬁlms on glass ( 9 ) . 
All salmonellae tested in this study are able to form strong bioﬁlms , regardless of wheth-er they are clinical isolates , isolates from produce or meat , or related to outbreaks resulting from the consumption of contaminated produce or meat . 
Interestingly , when these Salmonella isolates were regrouped by moving the produce-related and meat-related strains arising from outbreaks to the list of clinical isolates , the ODs of the clinical isolates a Average OD ( 590 nm ) of isolates of a given morphotype in the speciﬁed medium . 
Within the medium , letters ( A , B ) indicate no signiﬁcant differences among isolate groups ( P ,0.05 , ANOVA ) . 
were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the remaining meat-and produce-related strains when tested in 1⁄20 - TSB ( data not shown ) . 
We found no differences in bioﬁlm formation between clinical , meat-related , or produce-related isolates in any of our test media . 
ODs measured for the isolates in LB plus 2 % glucose were similar to those reported for Salmonella Typhimurium after 18 h of incubation at 308C ( 17 ) . 
In addition , ODs measured in TSB were similar to those found by Stepanović et al. ( 30 ) for moderate-to-strong bioﬁlmforming strains . 
The observation that nutrient-limited media ( 1⁄20 - TSB ) was effective in promoting bioﬁlm formation agrees with previously published reports ( 7 , 31 ) . 
Transcription of the csgD gene , which positively controls curli and cellulose production , has been shown to increase under nu-trient-limiting conditions in Salmonella ( 13 ) . 
The morphotypes of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from clinical and animal origins have been reported previously ( 27 ) . 
Solano et al. ( 27 ) surveyed 63 clinical strains and found 76 and 24 % exhibiting the rdar and saw morphotypes , respectively . 
Animal-related isolates exhibited the rdar morphotype at a rate of 71 % ( 27 ) . 
In contrast , approximately 73 % of our clinical isolates and 84 % of our meat-related isolates displayed the rdar morphotype . 
The rdar morphotype has been linked to increased virulence , and it is not surprising that most of the isolates in our collection display rdar ( 23 ) . 
Batch culture under static conditions has been shown to be conducive for the production of curli and cellulose ( 27 ) . 
Both cell surface components have been demonstrated to be important in bioﬁlm formation on abiotic surfaces ; therefore , we hypothesized that rdar isolates might exhibit increased crystal violet binding ( 5 , 27 ) . 
When bioﬁlm formation was measured in TSB , the display of the rdar morphotype did not correlate with increased crystal violet binding in the microtiter plate assay compared to the display of the bdar or saw morphotype . 
Bdar isolates displayed signiﬁcantly higher crystal violet binding when tested in LB plus 2 % glucose . 
Both rdar and bdar isolates exhibited signiﬁcantly higher crystal violet binding than did saw strains in 1⁄20 - TSB . 
These data indicate that cell surface components other than curli and cellulose may inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation and that the cell surface component ( s ) responsible may vary due to environmental conditions . 
Our results indicate that the incidence of cellulose production and curli biosynthesis is different for isolates fro a variety of sources . 
Cellulose-deﬁcient strains were found only among produce isolates . 
Barak et al. ( 2 ) found that Salmonella adhered more strongly to alfalfa sprouts than did Escherichia coli O157 : H7 and postulated that this resulted from the lack of curli production by E. coli O157 : H7 . 
Eighty percent of the produce-related isolates produced curli . 
All of the produce-related strains that expressed the saw morphotype were from produce-related outbreaks and not from collected food samples . 
This may further underscore the importance of curli in attachment to produce surfaces . 
The production of both cellulose and curli is important for the survival and persistence of Salmonella on surface environments ( 22 , 23 ) . 
Bioﬁlm formation by human path-ogens on fresh produce is not well characterized . 
While it is clear that Salmonella initiates bioﬁlm formation after contacting produce surfaces ( 1 , 4 ) , the role of these bioﬁlms in protecting the pathogen against aqueous sanitizers is not clear . 
The reduced efﬁcacy of sanitizers on attached bacteria lends credence to the hypothesis that bacteria embedded within bioﬁlms are more resistant ( especially after 1 or more days of storage ) to inactivation . 
Our results demonstrate that bioﬁlm formation is not inﬂuenced by the origin of the test isolate . 
The role of bioﬁlm formation , curli , and cellulose in establishing bacteria on the surface of fruits and vegetables must be characterized in order to put forth more effective postharvest intervention treatments .
