Abstract expressing the 14-kDa Schistosoma mansoni antigen , Sm14 . 
Bacterial adjuvants , including ( i ) Lactococcus lactis expressing interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) and ( ii ) Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 , were also employed in oral immunization assays . 
Detection assays to speciﬁc IgG and IgA anti-Sm14 antibodies were performed to evaluate humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice . 
An increase in speciﬁc IgG titers was observed ; however , no IgA production was detected . 
The protection levels against schistosomiasis ( 34.9 -- 49.5 % ) obtained with all experimental formulations in this work were very similar to values reported by previous studies , which used puriﬁed recombinant Sm14 for parenteral vaccination of mice . 
There was a slight reduction in hepatic granulomas of mice vaccinated with Salmonella . 
Oogram studies showed diminished numbers of S. mansoni eggs in the intestinal wall of vaccinated mice , but individual female worm fecundity did not seem to be affected by our immunization protocol .

1. Introduction
Schistosomiasis is still a major problem worldwide , ranking with malaria and tuberculosis in global public health importance ( Bergquist , 2002 ; Chitsulo et al. , 2004 ) . 
The main control strategy for this parasitic disease relies on chemotherapy with the anti-helmintic drug praziquantel ; however , it is generally agreed that this approach has limitations , including high reinfection rates in endemic areas ( Capron et al. , 2002 ; Al-Sherbiny et al. , 2003 ) . 
An effective vaccine would provide a very desirable complementary long-term control strategy ( Bergquist et al. , 2002 ; Pearce , 2003 ) . 
In this context , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) selected six molecule candidates that are considered the most promising to compose a subunit vaccine against schistosomiasis ( Bergquist , 1995 ) . 
One of them is the 14-kDa Schistosoma mansoni antigen Sm14 , which is a cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein whose mRNA is expressed at high levels in the schistosomula , adult worms and eggs ( Brito et al. , 2002 ) . 
This antigen induces partial protection against experimental schistosomiasis and fascioliasis in mice immunized by parenteral routes ( Moser et al. , 1991 ; Tendler et al. , 1996 ; Vilar et al. , 2003 ; Fonseca et al. , 2004 ) . 
It has not been yet used in human trials , but apparently it is in the ﬁnal stages of scale-up production ( Pearce , 2003 ; Vilar et al. , 2003 ) . 
Studies on immune responses to Sm14 antigen that correlate with resistance to infection have suggested a role for cell-mediated immunity ( Brito et al. , 2000a ; Al-Sherbiny et al. , 2003 ; Fonseca et al. , 2004 ) . 
A hypothetical schistosomiasis vaccine using this protein could be delivered in a way such that it stimulates cellular immunity , strengthening the beneﬁts associated with the use of this candidate antigen ( Al-Sherbiny et al. , 2003 ) . 
The use of attenuated Salmonella as a live vector to administrate heterologous proteins was already shown to induce this arm of the immune system ( Kaufmann et al. , 2001 ; Kotton and Hohmann , 2004 ) . 
It was also found to be successful in eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses against several parasitic antigens ( Xu et al. , 1995 ; Lee et al. , 2000 ; Ruiz-Pe ́rez et al. , 2002 ; Garmory et al. , 2002 ) . 
Vaccination using bacterial carriers is generally advantageous , since they are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and are well suited for large-scale immunization ( Medina and Guzmán , 2001 ; Garmory et al. , 2003 ) . 
Furthermore , they can be administrated orally , which is a practical and reliable route for large-scale public health vaccination programs ( Shata et al. , 2000 ) . 
In addition to the antigen administration route , adjuvants have a strong inﬂuence on the effectiveness of a vaccine , since they can be applied to modulate the immune response in a desirable direction ( Comoy et al. , 1998 ) . 
Some bacterial strains have recognized adjuvant features , and they have the advantage of all the administration facilities associated with bacterial carriers mentioned above ( Neumann et al. , 1998 ; Bermúdez - Humarán et al. , 2003 ) . 
We used a live attenuated Salmonella enterica var . 
Typhimurium vaccine strain producing the recombinant antigen Sm14 for oral immunization in mice , with and without the bacterial adjuvants Lactococcus lactis expressing interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , or Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 . 
The induced humoral immune response included speciﬁc production of IgG anti-Sm14 antibodies , whereas IgA anti-Sm14 was not detected in the intervals tested . 
Immunization with the Salmonella ( rSm14 ) strain afforded protection to SWISS mice challenged with S. mansoni cercaria . 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
in Table 1 ; Escherichia coli and S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium strains were aerobically grown in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( DIFCO ) at 37 ◦ C . 
The L. lactis strain was anaerobically grown at 30 ◦ C in M17 broth ( DIFCO ) supplemented with 0.5 % glucose . 
The L. delbrueckii strain was anaerobically grown in Lactobacilli MRS Broth ( DIFCO ) at 37 ◦ C. Plasmids were selected by the addition of antibiotics : ampicillin ( 100 g/ml ) for E. coli and S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium , and chloramphenicol ( 10 g/ml ) for L. lactis . 
The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed 
2.2. DNA manipulations
Typhimurium was isolated as previously described ( Birnboim and Doly , 1979 ) . 
DNA restriction and modiﬁcation enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers . 
General DNA manipulation techniques a Plasmid DNA from E. coli and S. enterica var . 
well as preparation of competent cells , were performed according to standard procedures ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) . 
Transformation of bacterial cells was done by electroporation ( 2.5 KV , 25 FD , 200 ) . 
2.3. Protein expression analysis
Samples of S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium cultures harboring the plasmid pMal : Sm14 were analyzed before and after induction with IPTG ( isopropyl -- d-thiogalactopyranoside ) . 
The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 60 mM Tris -- HCl , pH 6.8 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % - mercaptoethanol and 0.01 % bromophenol blue . 
Protein samples were boiled for 5 min separated in 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( SDS-PAGE ) and visualized by Coomassie blue staining . 
2.4. Immunization of mice
Eight groups of eight 6 -- 8 week-old female SWISS mice were used for the immunization experiment . 
They were inoculated intragastrically using a gavage needle with 109 cells of each bacterial strain resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , 100 l per animal ) . 
The L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 strain was grown for 20 h and administrated to one group of mice during 7 days , before the beginning of the vaccination protocol . 
The S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium SL3261 strains harboring pMALTM-c2 or pMal : Sm14 plasmids were grown to an OD600 = 0.5 -- 0.6 ; the expression of the fusion protein was then induced by the addition of IPTG , at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.6 mM . 
Four hours later , these cultures were used to immunize mice . 
The L. lactis NZ9000 strain harboring the pSEC : scIL-12 plasmid was grown to an OD600 = 0.4 -- 0.5 ; it was then induced by the addition of nisin , at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 ng/ml . 
Three hours later , this culture was used to immunize mice . 
The immunization protocol extended for 1 month and was applied on days 0 , 1 , 2 , 14 , 15 , 28 and 29 . 
Two groups of mice received the S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium SL3261 strain that produces the Sm14 protein plus L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 or L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) . 
2.5. Experimental infection, worm burden recovery and protection analysis
Forty-ﬁve days after the beginning of the immunization protocol , the mice were transcutaneousl challenged with 50 S. mansoni LE strain cercariae , shed by laboratory-reared and infected Biomphalaria glabrata . 
Forty-two days post-infection , the mice were sacriﬁced by cervical fracture and adult worms were recovered by hepatic and mesenteric perfusion using the Pellegrino and Siqueira ( 1956 ) technique , with minor modiﬁcations ; they were counted under a dissecting microscope , to evaluate the worm burden . 
The level of protection was calculated as follows : P = [ ( C − V ) / C ] × 100 , where P is the % protection , C the mean worm count in control animals and V is the mean worm count in vaccinated animals .

2.6. Oogram studies and histopathological analysis
Following perfusion for recovering of the schistosomes , fragments of the intestine ( terminal ileum ) from each animal were separated and transferred to petri dishes containing saline . 
The intestines were opened lengthwise and the excess mucus was removed . 
Onecentimeter fragments were cut-off , partially dried on absorbent paper , weighed and placed between a glass slide and a plastic cover . 
The preparation was inverted and pressed on a rubber surface padded with ﬁlter paper ( Pellegrino and Faria , 1965 ) . 
Then , the slides were examined with a microscope ( 100 × ) and all the eggs were counted . 
Quantitative oograms were obtained , using the formula : number of eggs/grams of tissue = number of eggs in intestinal fragment/weight of fragment in mg . 
A qualitative oogram evaluation was made , in which the developmental stages of the eggs were classiﬁed following criteria previously described by Pellegrino et al. ( 1962 ) . 
The percentage of each egg stage was calculated . 
Also , the ratio ` number of second stage eggs/number of female S. mansoni worms ' was calculated in order to obtain individual fecundity of the parasites . 
Liver fragments were collected , ﬁxed in 10 % formalin and processed for parafﬁn embedding , for histological studies . 
Five-micrometer thick sections were stained with haematoxylin -- eosin . 
Measurements of the granulomas were made with the aid of a micrometered ocular square adapted to the microscope . 
2.7. Sampling of the mice
and 87 and stored at − 70 ◦ C , until required . 
Fresh fecal Serum samples were taken on days 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 pellets were collected on days 15 , 24 , 38 , 47 , 62 and 70 . 
PBS ( 1 ml ) supplemented with 1 % of bovine serum albumine ( BSA ) and 1 mM of phenyl methyl sulforyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) ( Sigma ) was added to 100 mg of fresh fecal pellets and incubated overnight , at 4 ◦ C. Fecal samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 17,900 × g. Supernatants were stored at − 70 ◦ C , until required . 
2.8. Production of recombinant Sm14 protein
E. coli harboring the pMal : Sm14 construct was grown in LB medium ( 1 l ) , supplemented with 0.1 % glucose and ampicillin ( 100 g/ml ) . 
The expression of the fusion protein was induced by 0.4 mM IPTG . 
After 3 h , the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6800 × g at 4 ◦ C , for 20 min , and the supernatant was discarded . 
The pellet , resuspended in PBS , was frozen at − 70 ◦ C and thawed three times . 
The resulting suspension was sonicated twice for 15 s , and then centrifuged at 2700 × g for 45 min . 
The proteins present in the bacterial supernatant were analyzed in 12 % SDS-PAGE gel to determine if the recombinant protein was present . 
E. coli lysates containing the induced MBP/Sm14 fusion protein were diluted 1:5 in PBS , pH 7.2 . 
The suspension was then loaded into an amylose resin column ( New England Biolabs ) and washed 10 times with PBS . 
The fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM maltose solution and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay . 
2.9. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
1 g/ml of puriﬁed Sm14 protein in 0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer , pH 9.6 . 
Wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1 % BSA for serum samples , or with 3 % BSA for feces samples , both in PBS-T20 solution ( PBS 1 × , pH 7.2 ; 0.1 % Tween 20 ) . 
The plates were then incubated with 0.1 ml of serum samples diluted 1:50 in PBS-T20 for 2 h at 37 ◦ C , or overnight at 4 ◦ C with 50 l of fecal extracts . 
Washes were performed with PBS-T20 between incubations . 
Anti-mouse IgA ( Sigma ) diluted 1:1000 or IgG ( Promega ) diluted 1:2500 , both conjugated with peroxidase , were incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦ C with fecal extracts and serum samples , respectively . 
Plate ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 ◦ C with were developed with 0.04 % o-phenylenediamine and 6 % H2O2 in 0.15 M citrate -- phosphate buffer , pH 5.0 , and the reaction was stopped 5 min later with 5 % H2SO4 . 
Sample readings were taken at 490 nm . 
2.10. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of three independent immunization and challenge experiments was performed with the Student 's t-test or the ANOVA test , using the computer software package MINITAB ( Minitab Inc. , State College , PA ) .

3. Results
3.1. Expression of recombinant Sm14 protein in S. enterica var. Typhimurium
The recombinant plasmid pMal : Sm14 was isolated from E. coli and transferred into S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium SL3261 by electroporation . 
The Salmonella vaccine strain efﬁciently produced the Sm14 recombinant antigen fused with maltose-binding protein ( MBP ) under IPTG induction , at a molecular mass of around 56.7 kDa , which corresponds to the expected molecular mass of the fusion product of MBP ( 42.7 kDa ) and Sm14 ( 14 kDa ) . 
The highest level of fusion protein production was reached 4 h following induction , as shown by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1 ) . 
At this point , the vaccine strain was used to immunize mice . 
3.2. Antibody responses to rSm14
the S. enterica var . 
Typhimurium recombinant strains , samples were taken from experimental mice at 2-week intervals , and speciﬁc IgG and IgA anti-Sm14 antibodies were evaluated by ELISA , for serum and feces samples , respectively . 
No IgA anti-Sm14 antibody production was detectable , in any of the intervals tested ( data not shown ) . 
Sm14 had augmented titers of total anti-Sm14 IgG , when compared to the negative-control group . 
There was an increase in IgG titers in the experimental groups after the ﬁrst boost ( day 30 ) , and the titers remaine Following the ﬁrst dose of oral vaccination with The groups that received Salmonella-producing high after challenge ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The IgG anti-Sm14 levels found in the mouse groups treated with the different adjuvant strains , together with the Salmonella vaccine , were similar to those measured in the SL3261 pMal : Sm14 group ( data not shown ) .

To measure the protective immunity against schistosomiasis induced by vaccination with Salmonella-producing Sm14 antigen alone , or associated with L. delbrueckii or L. lactis adjuvant strains , SWISS mice were challenged with S. mansoni LE cercariae and the level of protection was calculated as the reduction in the mean worm burden recovered in the experimental groups compared to each control group . 
The protection levels induced by the three experimental formulations , SL3261 pMal : Sm14 , alone , or combined with L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 or L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) , ranged from 34.9 to 49.47 % ( Table 2 ) .

3.4. Oogram studies
Oogram data are presented in Table 3 . 
The immature stage distribution of S. mansoni eggs present in mouse-intestine fragments appeared normal in all groups . 
The average numbers of eggs in the SL3261 pMal : Sm14 , SL3261 pMal : Sm14 + L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 and SL3261 pMal : Sm14 + L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) vaccinated groups were signiﬁcantly lower than in the PBS-control group . 
There were reductions of 44 , 44.5 and 52 % , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The ratio ` number of second stage eggs/number of female S. mansoni worms ' was not signiﬁcantly altered in the vaccinated groups ( Table 3 ) .

4. Discussion
We found that it is possible to produce high levels of recombinant Sm14 antigen in a S. enterica vaccine strain ( SL3261 pMal : Sm14 ) , which induces protective immunity against experimental schistosomiasis in mice . 
This vaccination strategy , using a live attenuated bacterial vector as a producer of a heterologous antigen , offers many technical advantages , including facilities in the productive process , compared to subunit vaccines , and the possibility of delivering it by the oral route , which makes the vaccine safer than injectable vaccines and which facilitates administration ( Kotton and Hohmann , 2004 ) . 
A previous study by Khan et al. ( 1994 ) reported the production of an antigen from S. mansoni , glutathione S transferase ( Sm28-GST ) , fused to the highly immunogenic tetanus toxin fragment C ( TTFC ) by the Salmonella SL3261 strain . 
They demonstrated protective immunity induction against tetanus toxin and virulent Salmonella challenges in mice immunized with their vaccine strain ; however , they did not measure protection against S. mansoni infection . 
We were able to induce signiﬁcant protection against experimental schistosomiasis with an orally administrated bacterial vaccine . 
In addition to evaluating the protection engendered by oral immunization with our recombinant Sm14-producing Salmonella strain , we sought to determine whether co-administration of a bacterial adjuvant , L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) or L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 , could enhance this protection level . 
L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) is a food-grade bacterium that has been genetically engineered to produce a recombinant IL-12 ( Bermúdez - Humarán et al. , 2003 ) . 
This cytokine is considered a good adjuvant in vaccination strategies against some parasitic infections , including schistosomiasis , due to its immunostimulatory properties ( Wynn et al. , 1996 ; Fonseca et al. , 2004 ) . 
L delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 has been proposed as a probiotic strain , which induces a systemic immune response in mice by stimulating the phagocytic capacity of the host macrophages and by promoting the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines ( Neumann et al. , 1998 ) . 
We were able to detect a moderate production of speciﬁc IgG anti-Sm14 antibodies in SL3261 ( rSm14 ) - vaccinated mice . 
The antibody titers did not vary when the adjuvant strains were co-administrated . 
In a similar vaccination strategy described by Varaldo et al. ( 2004 ) , a recombinant Sm14-producing Mycobacterium bovis BCG was used to immunize mice intraperitoneally ; however , induction of humoral immunity against this antigen was not detected . 
Additionally , Khan et al. ( 1994 ) reported diminished antibody production against the S. mansoni antigen Sm28-GST , only when their recombinant Salmonella SL3261 vaccine strain was administrated orally , but not when it was inoculated intravenously . 
In this context , we can hypothesize that our SL3261 ( rSm14 ) strain would induce higher levels of IgG anti-Sm14 if it was delivered by a parenteral route rather than the oral route though this remains to be tested . 
Previous studies have proposed a role for antiSm14 IgG antibodies in the immune response against schistosomiasis in human patients ( Brito et al. , 2000b ; Al-Sherbiny et al. , 2003 ) . 
Therefore , though moderate levels of this isotype have been detected in mouse sera , we should not totally discard the participation of this arm of the immune system in the protection engendered by our vaccination protocol . 
our bacterial vaccine strain , we did not detect antiSm14 IgA antibody production . 
Similarly , Baras et al. ( 1999 ) did not detect speciﬁc production of IgA anti-Sm28 after oral immunization of mice with the antigen encapsulated in microparticles . 
This antibody isotype has been proposed to play a protective role against schistosomiasis in studies of vaccination of rats with the Sm28-GST antigen , as well as in studies of human immune responses toward this antigen ( Capron et al. , 2002 ) . 
Moreover , in another report of mucosal immunization of mice using liposomeassociated Sm28-GST , speciﬁc production of IgA was demonstrated ( Ivanoff et al. , 1996 ) . 
However , Ribeiro et al. ( 2002 ) evaluated the humoral immune response induced in mice immunized with different doses of rSm14 , and they also did not detect speciﬁc anti-Sm14 IgA antibodies , indicating that this antigen induces Though we used a mucosal administration route for very little , if any , of this antibody isotype . 
Therefore , IgA may not be involved in the protection against schistosomiasis afforded by Sm14 vaccination . 
We found that oral immunization with Sm14-producing Salmonella vaccine strain induced partial protection against schistosomiasis in SWISS mice ( 35 -- 49.47 % ) , quite similar to levels obtained with subcutaneous ( s.c. ) vaccination of rSm14 ( Tendler et al. , 1996 ; Fonseca et al. , 2004 ) . 
In a more recent work , Abreu et al. ( 2004 ) reported 34.9 -- 50 % protection in mice immunized s.c. with rSm14 , together with or fused with TTFC . 
Again , our protection levels with an oral vaccine were very similar to the values obtained with vaccines administrated by parenteral routes . 
The overall immunological mechanisms involved in schistosomiasis protection are very complex , and many questions remain to be investigated ( Hoffmann and Wynn , 2000 ; Bergquist et al. , 2002 ) . 
Many studies on this subject attempted to evaluate the immune responses associated with deﬁned vaccine candidate antigens ( Al-Sherbiny et al. , 2003 ) . 
In this context , the immune response toward recombinant Sm14 in human schistosomiasis was proposed to involve a Th1 proﬁle , including cellular effector mechanisms and the immunostimulatory cytokines , interferon - ( IFN - ) and tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) ( Brito et al. , 2000a ) . 
Moreover , a recent study demonstrated that these cytokines enhance protective immunity in mice injected with rSm14 and IL-12 ( Fonseca et al. , 2004 ) , the latter is a typical Th1-cytokine . 
Though we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in worm burdens recovered in vaccinated groups when an adjuvant strainproducing IL-12 was co-administrated with SL3261 ( rSm14 ) ( Table 2 ) , we were able to evaluate whether there were alterations in the pathology associated with schistosomiasis . 
against schistosomiasis is a reduction in parasite-induced aggression in the vertebrate host ( Pearce , 2003 ) . 
Wynn ( 1996 ) defended the development of an antipathological vaccine for schistosomiasis based on IL-12 immunoregulation . 
Supporting this hypothesis , Fonseca et al. ( 2004 ) found a reduction of the hepatic granuloma area when 1 g of recombinant IL-12 was co-administered s.c. with Sm14 in an immunization assay that induced partial protection against challenge with S. mansoni . 
Bermúdez - Humarán et al. ( 2003 ) observed immunomodulation in mice inoculate A very desirable feature in a putative vaccine intranasally with recombinant L. lactis secreting IL-12 and suggested that oral or nasal delivery of this microorganism provokes mucosal surface immune responses , thus being suitable for vaccine utilization . 
Our data are suggestive of a possible effect on schistosome-induced granuloma formation , since there was a slight reduction in granuloma diameters measured in all the groups that received Salmonella , except one , when compared to the control ( PBS ) group ( Table 4 ) . 
However , we did not observe alterations in hepatic inﬂammatory inﬁltrates or in granuloma diameters among the vaccinated groups , even when L. lactis NZ ( pSEC : scIL-12 ) was associated . 
The long period from vaccination priming and infection until sacriﬁce , the amount of IL-12 produced , and its availability after oral administration , are the main parameters that could explain our histopathological observations . 
On the other hand , the signiﬁcant reduction in the number of total S. mansoni eggs found in mouse tissue samples ( Fig. 3 ) may account for the low morbidity , since portal inﬂammation and schistosomiasis pathology depend on the deposition of eggs in the host 's liver . 
As already mentioned , adjuvant strains and live vectors , such as Salmonella , L. lactis and L. delbrueckii , greatly inﬂuence the immune response polarization against protein antigens ( Comoy et al. , 1997 ; Comoy et al. , 1998 ; Neumann et al. , 1998 ; Bermúdez - Humarán et al. , 2003 ) . 
Hayashi et al. ( 1999 ) , studying Kuppfer cells , demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces an increased production of polarizing cytokines in mice infected or not with S. mansoni . 
Consequently , the PBS group was considered the ideal control for the oogram , since it is a very sensitive method that is inﬂuenced by both parasite and host-related factors . 
In fact , immunological alterations in experimental schistosomiasis are easily detected by changes in quantitative oograms , as seen when the subjects are treated with drugs such as dexamethasone ( Hermeto et al. , 1994 ) and pentoxifylline ( Mati et al. , unpublished results ) . 
in female parasite fecundity , mainly in studies with Sm28-GST based vaccines ( Boulanger et al. , 1991 ; Ivanoff et al. , 1996 ; Capron et al. , 2001 ) . 
The lowered ratios ` ( number of second stage eggs/g of tissue ) / number of female worms ' found in our vaccinated groups were not signiﬁcantly different , indicating that there was no vaccine-induced alteration in S. mansoni Some authors have reported considerable reductions fecundity ( Table 3 ) . 
Although Ivanoff et al. ( 1996 ) did not observe a signiﬁcant reduction in the quantity of eggs laid per female , they consider that only a reduction in adult worm burden would not be sufﬁcient to explain diminished numbers of eggs in host tissue , since they propose an increase in fecundity in the parasite population when the worms are less numerous . 
However , the ratios of eggs per female worm in the host tissues are not inversely proportional to the total number of parasites . 
Based on our ﬁndings , it seems that the decrease in parasite burden is the main factor accounting for the reduction in total oviposition of S. mansoni . 
The normal distribution of the developmental stages of eggs in the control and in the vaccinated groups indicates that there were no alterations in the oviposition kinetics of the parasite . 
The oogram technique was not utilized in the other studies . 
In our experiment , the lack of confounding factors and the observation of newly-laid eggs made the evaluation of second stage immature eggs by an oogram an excellent parameter to analyze alterations in fecundity among the female parasites . 
In conclusion , the oral vaccination of mice with a live attenuated Salmonella strain expressing the Sm14 antigen afforded a level of protection against S. mansoni infection quite similar to those previously reported for anti-schistosome vaccines administrated by parenteral routes . 
The co-administration of adjuvant strains did not signiﬁcantly alter this protection . 
Moderate levels of speciﬁc anti-Sm14 IgG antibodies were detected in the sera of vaccinated mice . 
A small reduction in hepatic granulomas was observed in mice vaccinated with Salmonella compared to those in the PBS group . 
Oogram studies showed diminished numbers of S. mansoni eggs in the intestinal wall of vaccinated mice , but this is more likely to be due to a reduction in worm burdens than to decreased fecundity of the female parasites .
